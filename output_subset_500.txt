38016198|t|Multimodal spatiotemporal monitoring of basal stem cell-derived organoids reveals progression of olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
38016198|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a highly prevalent symptom and an early sign of neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, the roles of peripheral olfactory system in disease progression and the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration remain to be studied. Olfactory epithelium (OE) organoid is an ideal model to study pathophysiology in vitro, yet the reliance on 3D culture condition limits continual in situ monitoring of organoid development. Here, we combined impedance biosensors and live imaging for real-time spatiotemporal analysis of OE organoids morphological and physiological features during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The impedance measurements showed that organoids generated from basal stem cells of APP/PS1 transgenic mice had lower proliferation rate than that from wild-type mice. In concert with the biosensor measurements, live imaging enabled to visualize the spatial and temporal dynamics of organoid morphology. Abnormal protein aggregation and accumulation, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, was found in AD organoids and increased as disease progressed. This multimodal in situ bioelectrical measurement and imaging provide a new platform for investigating onset mechanisms of OD, which would shed new light on early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

37258792|t|Identifying the potential role of serum miR-20a as a biomarker for olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease.
37258792|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction (OD), one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), is a cardinal prodromal symptom that can appear years before the onset of motor symptoms. Ongoing studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are suitable biomarkers for PD, while there is a lack of robust miRNAs that can serve as markers for OD in PD. METHODS: The concordantly differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in the damaged olfactory system were first identified in 2 OD-related Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Then, they were verified in another PD-related GEO dataset and only one miRNA (miR-20a) was found to be significantly altered. Serum levels of miR-20a were further measured by qPCR in 79 PD patients with OD (PD-OD), 52 PD patients without OD (PD-NOD), and 52 healthy controls (HC). Objective measure of OD was defined by 16-item Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test. All the participants underwent a demographic and comprehensive PD-related clinical assessment. RESULTS: Our results proved that miR-20a was significantly downregulated in PD-OD compared with PD-NOD and the area under curve (AUC) for OD detection by miR-20a was 0.803 (95% confidence interval, 0.724-0.883). In addition, PD-OD had higher scores of Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, Hoehn and Yahr stage (H-Y), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3, NMSS 5, NMSS 9, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Activity of Daily Living (ADL), and lower scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 39-item PD Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) than PD-NOD. Binary regression model further presented that lower expressions of miR-20a and poorer cognitive function acted as promoting factors in the development of OD. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-20a could be a novel biomarker for OD in PD and PD-OD patients tend to have higher disease stage, poorer motor aspects of experiences of daily living, worse cognitive scores, and inferior quality of life, and were more likely to have mental disorders. Cognitive function, in particular, is strongly associated with OD in PD patients.

33422806|t|Could COVID-19 anosmia and olfactory dysfunction trigger an increased risk of future dementia in patients with ApoE4?
33422806|a|The association of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with significant neurological and neuropsychiatric complications has been increasingly reported, both during the acute illness and in its aftermath. However, due to the short duration of patient follow up until now, it is not clear whether this infection will be associated with longer-term neurological and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. In particular, the question of whether COVID-19 will be associated with an increased risk and rate of future dementia remains open and subject to speculation. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients have reported sudden anosmia or other olfactory dysfunction as concurrent symptoms. The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may reach the brain via the olfactory nerve or an upper nasal trancribrial route is an interesting working hypothesis. Among the identified genetic risk factors for Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), Apo E4 is one of the strongest and most frequent. People carrying one or two copies of the e4 allele of Apo E4 have significant odor recognition deficits in comparison to those not carrying this haplotype. The hypothesis invoked in this paper is that anosmia/olfactory dysfunctions induced by SARS-CoV-2 may cause an increased a risk of future neurodegenerative dementia in ApoE4 carriers, and that this risk would be higher than in Apo E4 carriers affected by anosmia not induced by SARS-CoV-2. This would be associated with virus-induced chronic modifications in the central nervous system. It is proposed that COVID-19 patients with anosmia and no other serious symptoms should be followed up as part of specifically designed and approved studies in order to identify the early stages of dementia (especially LOAD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies), thereby improving our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in pre-cognitive stages of neurodegenerative dementia and making best use of any available therapies. This latter opportunity is unique and should not be lost.

23871228|t|Nicotine increases lifespan and rescues olfactory and motor deficits in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.
23871228|a|Drosophila melanogaster is an attractive model of familial Parkinson's disease, as flies with loss-of-function mutations of the parkin gene exhibit many pathologies observed in PD patients. Progressive motor deficits found in homozygous parkin mutants seem to result from mitochondrial pathology that causes indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration [1,2]. We have found that heterozygous parkin mutants have decreased lifespan, generally progressive motor dysfunction and olfactory deficits compared to control flies, suggesting that mutation of this gene produces a dominant phenotype. Tobacco smokers are dose-dependently less likely to develop PD [3,4]; subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies show that nicotine is protective in models of sporadic PD [6]. Literature addressing the potential protection by nicotine in Parkin loss-of-function models spans limited concentrations and selected time points in the organism's lifespan. We have found that parkin heterozygotes have late-onset climbing and flying deficits as well as decreased viability and olfactory deficits that precede motor defects. While chronic nicotine exposure decreases lifespan and climbing and flying abilities in control flies, it can improve viability and flying capability as well as rescue climbing and olfactory deficits in parkin heterozygotes. Dopaminergic neurons are spared in the parkin heterozygote, perhaps because this phenotype is less severe than in the homozygous parkin mutants. Nicotine pretreatment may be protective in sporadic PD patients and models; however, timely diagnosis remains to be an obstacle. Our results suggest that nicotine also may be protective in familial PD patients, who can be easily identified before motor symptoms occur.

35166976|t|Olfactory dysfunction is associated with motor function only in tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease.
35166976|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of olfactory impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is 50-90%, and therefore, olfactory dysfunction is one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in patients with PD. Numerous studies have evaluated the association between motor and non-motor symptoms and olfactory dysfunction in PD. AIM: In this study, we investigated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction, which is measured using the UPSIT test, with other motor and non-motor symptoms separately in three motor subtypes of PD, including tremor dominant (TD), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), and indeterminate and healthy subjects. METHODS: We recruited 487 early-stage PD patients (43 PIGD, 406 TD, and 38 indeterminate) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 197) from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). All participants completed motor and non-motor tests at baseline visit and after 4 years of follow-up. Subjects underwent common PD scaling tests. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction was significantly correlated with declined motor functions only in the TD subtype. Also, significant correlations were noticed between olfactory dysfunction and speed-attention processing and executive function in the HCs as well. Finally, no significant or meaningful association was observed in the PIGD and indeterminate subtype. Anosmia and hyposmia subjects in the TD group had the worse motor and non-motor scores compared to normosmia subjects after 4 years. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction was significantly correlated with declined motor functions in the TD subtype. This is indicating that olfactory dysfunction may be an early motor and non-motor biomarker only in the TD subtype. However, it is possible that the involvement of olfactory function in other subtypes is not strong enough to make it a useful marker of diseases progression.

31177212|t|Clinical, Structural, and Neuropathological Features of Olfactory Dysfunction in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
31177212|a|We explored changes in clinical features and neuropathological mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction (OD) in 60 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory function was evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks test and a threshold discrimination identification (TDI) score. Based on the TDI score, we divided patients according to the presence or absence of OD (AD-OD and AD-NOD, respectively). Cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated by a series of rating scales. The volumes and cortical thickness of the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala were measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropathological protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid were measured. The frequency of OD was 50%. TDI scores were lower in the AD-OD group than in the AD-NOD group (p < 0.001). Compared with the AD-NOD group, the AD-OD group showed greater cognitive function impairments (p < 0.001), and daily living activities were more severely compromised (p = 0.019). The AD-OD group had lower hippocampal and amygdala volumes (p = 0.025, p = 0.030, respectively) and a more pronounced reduction in cortical thickness (p = 0.010). The total tau level was lower in the AD-OD group than the AD-NOD group (p = 0.040). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and thinner AD-signature cortices were associated with lower TDI scores (OR = 0.826, p < 0.001; OR = 1.433, p = 0.008). Overall, in AD patients, the impairments in olfactory discrimination and identification seem to be more correlated with cognitive levels. OD in AD may be an indicator of pathological cognitive decline and structural changes.

26873234|t|[Impairment of Odor Recognition in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1].
26873234|a|There is evidence that impaired human cognitive abilities are reflected in loss of olfactory abilities. Declining olfactory perception may be a biomarker for impairment of cognitive function and of impending illnesses in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we reported that patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1) had lower sensitivity to emotional facial expressions as well as abnormal olfactory threshold or recognition level. In DM 1, pathological studies have reported neurofibrillary tangles in several temporal areas including the entorhinal cortex (ENT), hippocampus (HI), and the amygdala. We observed that patients with DM 1 showed signal abnormalities in the olfactory limbic areas on magnetic resonance imaging. Our findings underscore the need to pay careful attention to significant decreases in odor identification abilities caused by diverse forms of abnormal brain function, especially in the AMG, ENT and HI.

32583050|t|Olfactory testing does not predict beta-amyloid, MRI measures of neurodegeneration or vascular pathology in the British 1946 birth cohort.
32583050|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of olfactory identification deficits as a predictor of cerebral beta-amyloid status and other markers of brain health in cognitively normal adults aged ~ 70 years. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational cohort study. 389 largely healthy and cognitively normal older adults were recruited from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (1946 British Birth cohort) and investigated for olfactory identification deficits, as measured by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Outcome measures were imaging markers of brain health derived from 3 T MRI scanning (cortical thickness, entorhinal cortex thickness, white matter hyperintensity volumes); 18F florbetapir amyloid-PET scanning; and cognitive testing results. Participants were assessed at a single centre between March 2015 and January 2018. RESULTS: Mean (+- SD) age was 70.6 (+- 0.7) years, 50.8% were female. 64.5% had hyposmia and 2.6% anosmia. Olfaction showed no association with beta-amyloid status, hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, AD signature cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity volume, or cognition. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In the early 70s, olfactory function is not a reliable predictor of a range of imaging and cognitive measures of preclinical AD. Olfactory identification deficits are not likely to be a useful means of identifying asymptomatic amyloidosis. Further studies are required to assess if change in olfaction may be a proximity marker for the development of cognitive impairment.

22305338|t|Olfactory ERPs in an odor/visual congruency task differentiate ApoE epsilon4 carriers from non-carriers.
22305338|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory and semantic processing. AD patients and MCI patients at risk for AD show altered N400 ERP responses to incongruent visual and verbal stimuli. AD patients exhibit neuropathology in olfactory brain areas before cognitive symptoms, suggesting the potential for olfactory processing to reflect early pathology. Despite this, odor congruency has not been examined. We investigated odor-image congruency in older adults at genetic risk for AD. ApoE epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers were screened for anosmia, severe hyposmia, and dementia. Olfactory ERPs were measured 600-1300 ms following odor-image pairs. Odors were each presented once congruently and once incongruently via an olfactometer. Pz amplitude significantly decreased on incongruent trials in e4 carriers. Pz amplitude differences on congruous and incongruous trials were larger in non carriers. Regression indicated that congruency showed very high sensitivity and specificity for correctly classifying epsilon4 carriers from non-carriers.

39113792|t|Rbm24/Notch1 signaling regulates adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and mediates Parkinson-associated olfactory dysfunction.
39113792|a|Rationale: Adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) is essential for maintaining neural homeostasis, and its dysregulation contributes to anosmia and delayed tissue healing in neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite intricate regulatory networks identified in SVZ neurogenesis, the molecular mechanisms dynamically maintaining neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in response to physiological and pathological stimuli remain incompletely elucidated. Methods: We generated an RNA binding motif protein 24 (Rbm24) knockout model to investigate its impact on adult neurogenesis in the SVZ, employing immunofluorescence, immunoblot, electrophysiology, RNA-sequencing, and in vitro experiments. Further investigations utilized a PD mouse model, along with genetic and pharmacological manipulations, to elucidate Rbm24 involvement in PD pathology. Results: Rbm24, a multifaceted post-transcriptional regulator of cellular homeostasis, exhibited broad expression in the SVZ from development to aging. Deletion of Rbm24 significantly impaired NSPC proliferation in the adult SVZ, ultimately resulting in collapsed neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb. Notably, Rbm24 played a specific role in maintaining Notch1 mRNA stability in adult NSPCs. The Rbm24/Notch1 signaling axis was significantly downregulated in the SVZ of PD mice. Remarkably, overexpression of Rbm24 rescued disruption of adult neurogenesis and olfactory dysfunction in PD mice, and these effects were hindered by DAPT, a potent inhibitor of Notch1. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of the Rbm24/Notch1 signaling axis in regulating adult SVZ neurogenesis under physiological and pathological circumstances. This provides valuable insights into the dynamic regulation of NSPC homeostasis and offers a potential targeted intervention for PD and related neurological disorders.

28543731|t|Neuroimaging biomarkers and impaired olfaction in cognitively normal individuals.
28543731|a|OBJECTIVE: There is a need for inexpensive noninvasive tests to identify older healthy persons at risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) for enrollment in AD prevention trials. Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. METHODS: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (n = 829) to assess a composite AD signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and underwent 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (n = 306) and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (n = 305) positron emission tomography scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 829 CN participants (mean age = 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score < 6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope = -0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.76 to -0.09, p = 0.01 and slope = -0.72, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.28, p < 0.01, respectively). Reduced HVa, decreased AD signature cortical thickness, and increased amyloid accumulation were significantly associated with increased odds of anosmia. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that OI may be a noninvasive, inexpensive marker for risk stratification, for identifying participants at the preclinical stage of AD who may be at risk for cognitive impairment and eligible for inclusion in AD prevention clinical trials. These cross-sectional findings remain to be validated prospectively. Ann Neurol 2017;81:871-882.

38430690|t|Longitudinal brain changes in Parkinson's disease with severe olfactory deficit.
38430690|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are associated with distinct cognitive trajectories in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying neurobiology for this relationship remains unclear but may involve distinct patterns of neurodegeneration. This study aimed to examine longitudinal cortical atrophy and thinning in early-stage PD with severe olfactory deficit (anosmia) without and with concurrent probable RBD. METHODS: Longitudinal MRI data over four years of 134 de novo PD and 49 healthy controls (HC) from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) cohort were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Patients were categorized into those with anosmia by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score <= 18 (AO+) and those without (UPSIT score > 18, AO-). The AO+ group was further subdivided into AO+ with probable RBD (AO+RBD+) and without (AO+RBD-) for subanalysis. RESULTS: Compared to subjects without baseline anosmia, the AO+ group exhibited greater longitudinal declines in both volume and thickness in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri and right transverse temporal gyrus. Patients with concurrent anosmia and RBD showed more extensive longitudinal declines in cortical volume and thickness, involving additional brain regions including the bilateral precuneus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right paracentral gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: The atrophy/thinning patterns in early-stage PD with severe olfactory dysfunction include regions that are critical for cognitive function and could provide a structural basis for previously reported associations between severe olfactory deficit and cognitive decline in PD. Concurrent RBD might enhance the dynamics of cortical changes.

20211105|t|Smell and preclinical Alzheimer disease: study of 29 patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment.
20211105|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the olfactory function in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and the relationship to the progression from aMCI to Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Cohort prospective study on aMCI patients at the first evaluation (T0) and at the 18-month follow-up (T1). SETTING: Alzheimer Unit of the University of L'Aquila, Italy. METHODS: Twenty-nine aMCI patients were enrolled in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Olfactory function was studied with the Sniffin' Sticks Screening Test (SSST) and the Sniffin' Sticks Extended Test (SSET). Olfactory functions were related to neurocognitive functions assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mental Deterioration Battery (MDB). RESULTS: At T0, aMCI patients showed an olfactory impairment and all of the aMCI patients had lower olfaction scores at T1. At T1, 9 of the 29 aMCI patients (31%) developed AD and had lower mean SSST and SSET scores than 20 aMCI patients who did not develop AD. The most significant relationship was found between olfactory discrimination and visuospatial ability, language skill, and the Rey Immediate test of the MDB and between olfactory identification and the Rey Delayed test. CONCLUSION: Odour discrimination and identification performance correlated more prominently than detection thresholds with performance on neuropsychological tests. We concluded that the olfactory deficit occurs early in aMCI, so we suggest introducing the clinical routine use of the olfactory test for early identification of the progression of the decline from aMCI to AD.

20182024|t|Effects of caffeine in Parkinson's disease: from neuroprotection to the management of motor and non-motor symptoms.
20182024|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 60 years. Classically, PD is considered to be a motor system disease and its diagnosis is based on the presence of a set of cardinal motor signs (rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor) that are consequence of a pronounced death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Nowadays there is considerable evidence showing that non-dopaminergic degeneration also occurs in other brain areas which seems to be responsible for the deficits in olfactory, emotional and memory functions that precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. The present review attempts to examine results reported in epidemiological, clinical and animal studies to provide a comprehensive picture of the antiparkinsonian potential of caffeine. Convergent epidemiological and pre-clinical data suggest that caffeine may confer neuroprotection against the underlying dopaminergic neuron degeneration, and influence the onset and progression of PD. The available data also suggest that caffeine can improve the motor deficits of PD and that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists such as istradefylline reduces OFF time and dyskinesia associated with standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments. Finally, recent experimental findings have indicated the potential of caffeine in the management of non-motor symptoms of PD, which do not improve with the current dopaminergic drugs. Altogether, the studies reviewed provide strong evidence that caffeine may represent a promising therapeutic tool in PD, thus being the first compound to restore both motor and non-motor early symptoms of PD together with its neuroprotective potential.

36341691|t|Anosmia, mild cognitive impairment, and biomarkers of brain aging in older adults.
36341691|a|Olfactory impairment is a potential marker for prodromal dementia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This population-based study included 4214 dementia-free participants (age >=65 years). Olfaction was assessed using the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test. In the subsamples, we measured plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)40, Abeta42, total tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL; n = 1054); and quantified hippocampal, entorhinal cortex, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-signature cortical thickness (n = 917). Data were analyzed with logistic and linear regression models. In the total sample, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed in 1102 persons (26.2%; amnestic MCI, n = 931; non-amnestic MCI, n = 171). Olfactory impairment was significantly associated with increased likelihoods of MCI, amnestic MCI, and non-amnestic MCI. In the subsamples, anosmia was significantly associated with higher plasma total tau and NfL concentrations, smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes, and greater WMH volume, and marginally with lower AD-signature cortical thickness. These results suggest that cerebral neurodegenerative and microvascular lesions are common neuropathologies linking anosmia with MCI in older adults.

32249295|t|Orthonasal, but not Retronasal Olfaction Is Specifically Impaired in Parkinson's Disease.
32249295|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) appears several years before the presence of motor disturbance. Olfactory testing has the potential to serve as a tool for early detection of PD, but OD is not specific to PD as it affects up to 20% of the general population. Olfaction includes an orthonasal and a retronasal components; in some forms of OD, retronasal olfactory function is preserved. We aimed to evaluate whether combined testing components allows for discriminating between PD-related OD and non-Parkinsonian OD (NPOD). The objective of this study is to orthonasal and retronasal olfactory function in PD patients and compare them to a NPOD group and to healthy controls. We hypothesized that this combined testing allows to distinguish PD patients from both other groups. We included 32 PD patients, 25 NPOD patients, and 15 healthy controls. Both olfactory components were impaired in PD and NPOD patients, compared with controls; however, NPOD patients had significantly better orthonasal scores than PD patients. Furthermore, the ratio of retronasal/orthonasal score was higher in PD than in both other groups. In the NPOD group, orthonasal and retronasal scores were significantly correlated; no such correlation could be observed in PD patients. In summary, PD patients seem to rely on compensatory mechanisms for flavor perception. Combined orthonasal and retronasal olfactory testing may contribute to differentiate PD patients from patients with NPOD.

31935728|t|Inability to Smell Peppermint Is Related to Cognitive Decline: A Prospective Community-Based Study.
31935728|a|BACKGROUND: A few studies have demonstrated the association of poorer olfactory identification (OI) with poorer cognition in population-based cohorts. None of them considered the outcome associated with the inability to smell a certain odor. OBJECTIVE: To verify the hypothesis that at least one specific odor is associated with incident cognitive decline among older adults. METHODS: In the Shanghai Aging Study, a sub-cohort of 948 dementia-free participants who had baseline OI measurements were prospectively followed for 5 years. RESULTS: An inability to smell peppermint (beta = -0.44, p < 0.001), rose (beta = -0.14, p = 0.040), or coffee (beta = -0.37, p = 0.002) was inversely related to the annual rate of change in the Mini Mental State Examination score, and an inability to smell peppermint was associated with a higher risk for incident dementia (hazard ratio 2.67, 95% CI 1.44-4.96) after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that some odors, especially peppermint, might be considered as a potential predictor for dementia in older populations.

18779429|t|Phantosmias and Parkinson disease.
18779429|a|BACKGROUND: Impaired olfaction is a common, nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, qualitative olfactory disturbances, such as odor distortions, have not been extensively reported in this condition. OBJECTIVE: To describe 2 patients who reported positive olfactory symptoms preceding typical PD, which were consistent with olfactory hallucinations (phantosmias) in the absence of major smell deficit. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University hospital. Patients We describe 2 patients, both seen in 2007, who reported pleasant olfactory hallucinations for several years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Iodine I 123-labeled ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography and olfactometric testing results. RESULTS: The (123)I-labeled ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography showed reduced radiotracer uptake in both striatum more marked in the putamen and on the left side in patient 1 and reduced radiotracer uptake in both putamen more marked on the right side in patient 2. Olfactometric testing showed mild hyposmia in patient 1 and normal function in patient 2. The disappearance of the phantosmias in both patients coincided with the development of typical PD. CONCLUSION: We propose phantosmia as a new premotor manifestation of PD and suggest that qualitative abnormalities of olfaction, rather than the typical smell loss demonstrated in this condition, should be more carefully examined in the prodromal phase of PD.

35869271|t|Seed-induced Abeta deposition alters neuronal function and impairs olfaction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
35869271|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) which ultimately forms plaques. These Abeta deposits can be induced in APP transgenic mouse models by prion-like seeding. It has been widely accepted that anosmia and hyposmia occur during the early stages of AD, even before cognitive deficits are present. In order to determine the impact of seed-induced Abeta deposits on olfaction, we performed intracerebral injections of seed-competent brain homogenate into the olfactory bulb of young pre-depositing APP transgenic mice. Remarkably, we observed a dramatic olfactory impairment in those mice. Furthermore, the number of newborn neurons as well as the activity of cells in the mitral cell layer was decreased. Notably, exposure to an enriched environment reduced Abeta seeding, vivified neurogenesis and most importantly reversed olfactory deficits. Based on our findings, we conclude that altered neuronal function as a result of induced Abeta pathology might contribute to olfactory dysfunction in AD.

11385006|t|Anosmia in dementia is associated with Lewy bodies rather than Alzheimer's pathology.
11385006|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess olfactory function of patients with dementia. Odour detection ability is impaired in clinical Parkinson's disease. Evidence of impaired detection in patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease is inconsistent. No studies of olfaction have been neuropathologically validated. METHODS: The olfactory function of 92 patients with dementia and 94 controls was assessed using a simple bedside test as part of the Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA). Neuropathological assessment was made of cortical Lewy bodies and substantia nigra (SN) cell counts and of Alzheimer's disease in all 92 patients, 22 of whom had SN Lewy bodies and 43 of whom had only Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Patients with Lewy bodies were more likely to be anosmic than those with Alzheimer's disease or controls. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were not more likely to be anosmic than controls. Nor was anosmia associated with degree of neurofibrillary tangles, as assessed by Braak stage. Among subjects with Lewy bodies, overall cortical Lewy body scores and Lewy body density in the cingulate were higher in those who were anosmic. Consensus clinical criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies had a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 89%. In the absence of definite Alzheimer's disease, the criteria had sensitivity of 100%. In patients with definite Alzheimer's disease, anosmia was slightly more sensitive (55%) than the consensus criteria (33%). However, the addition of anosmia to the consensus criteria did not improve their overall performance. CONCLUSION: Dementia with Lewy bodies is associated with impaired odour detection. Misdiagnosis may have accounted for some previous reports of impaired odour detection in Alzheimer's disease. Simple but more sensitive tests of anosmia are required if they are to be clinically useful in identifying patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.

17553102|t|Alpha-synuclein pathology in the olfactory pathways of dementia patients.
17553102|a|Lewy-type pathology is a characteristic of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Thus far, the definitive diagnosis of these dementias can only be confirmed at post-mortem. However, it is known that the loss of smell (anosmia) is an early symptom in patients who develop dementia, and the use of the smell test has been proposed as an early diagnostic procedure. The aim of this study was to understand further the extent of Lewy pathology in the olfactory system of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Post-mortem tissue from 250 subjects was obtained from the OPTIMA brain bank. Five areas of the olfactory pathway were examined by immunolabelling for alpha-synuclein - a major component of Lewy pathology: the olfactory tract/bulb (n = 79), the anterior olfactory nucleus in the lateral olfactory gyrus (n = 193), the region of olfactory projection to the orbito-frontal cortex (n = 225), the hippocampus (n = 236) and the amygdala (n = 201). Results show that Lewy pathology affects different parts of the olfactory pathways differentially, suggesting a specific pattern of development of pathology. Clinical Parkinson's disease is most likely to be identified if the orbito-frontal cortex is affected, while the diagnosis is less likely if the pathology is restricted to the olfactory bulb or tract. These results suggest that pathology in the olfactory bulb and tract occurs prior to clinical signs of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the results presented here provide further evidence supporting the possible value of a smell test to aid the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

26003671|t|Olfaction deterioration in cognitive disorders in the elderly.
26003671|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases are widespread neurodegenerative pathologies. Parkinson's disease affects about 1 % of the population over the age of 65 years, while Alzheimer is considered the most common cause of dementia, with an annual incidence of 1 % in persons aged 65 years. It has been demonstrated that both these neurodegenerative diseases are associated with smell dysfunction. AIM: The aim of the present review is to describe briefly modern olfactory evaluation tools as well as the importance of olfactory sensitivity screening in the elderly, especially where cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, are suspected. METHODS: A brief literature review focusing on the basic principle of smell tests is illustrated together with their application in elderly patients affected by cognitive disorders, in particular Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are both neurodegenerative disorders typically found in the elderly. As both diseases are characterized by the early presence of dysosmia, simple validated smell tests could very well help clinicians in the early diagnosis of these neuropathological conditions. Elderly patients complaining of smell loss and found to be dysosmic, by means of validated olfactory tests, should be neurologically evaluated as early as possible to detect slight motor abnormalities in an at-risk population.

31531013|t|Sudden Intrabulbar Amyloid Increase Simultaneously Disrupts Olfactory Bulb Oscillations and Odor Detection.
31531013|a|There seems to be a correlation between soluble amyloid beta protein (Abeta) accumulation in the main olfactory bulb (OB) and smell deterioration in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and animal models. Moreover, this loss of smell appears to be related to alterations in neural network activity in several olfactory-related circuits, including the OB, as has been observed in anesthetized animals and brain slices. It is possible that there is a correlation between these two pathological phenomena, but a direct and simultaneous evaluation of the acute and direct effect of Abeta on OB activity while animals are actually smelling has not been performed. Thus, here, we tested the effects of acute intrabulbar injection of Abeta at a low dose (200 pmol) on the OB local field potential before and during the presence of a hidden piece of smelly food. Our results show that Abeta decreases the power of OB network activity while impairing the animal's ability to reach the hidden food. We found a strong relationship between the power of the OB oscillations and the correlation between OBs and the olfactory detection test scores. These findings provide a direct link between Abeta-induced OB network dysfunction and smell loss in rodents, which could be extrapolated to AD patients.

7324865|a|Various reports concerning the oro-alimentary ducts of dements and increasing arguments in favour of a new etiopathogenic hypothesis for Pick's disease, involving impaired zinc metabolism and histological lesions partly linked with the hodology of the olfactory system, lie at the origin of our present clinical interest in olfaction. In a first stage, using a technique based on dilution with N-propanol, we observed certain conditions permitting an evaluation of the olfactory capacities of patients with Pick's disease, senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescense. There does not seem to be a decline in olfaction with age. Olfactory capacities in the two forms of dementia studied were distinctly inferior to those of non-dements. Olfactory habituation was more marked, especially in Pick's disease where there were also paradoxical responses which seemed to form part of a more general change in reaction to stimulus. In senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescence the response to olfactory stimulus declines with dilution of N-propanol and lesional extension. Observation of recorded parameters (EEG, psycho-galvanic reflex, ocular movement, breathing) is useful in Pick's disease and may be difficult in senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescence. Olfactory capacities appear to constitute an additional criterion on which to base a diagnosis of dementia. They could be used to help establish the neuro-biological bases of certain types of demential behaviour and to observe the progress of tentative therapies.

25633674|t|Olfactory cortex degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
25633674|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits are prevalent in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These symptoms precede clinical onset of cognitive and memory deficits and coincide with AD pathology preferentially in the central olfactory structures, suggesting a potential biomarker for AD early detection and progression. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that structural degeneration of the primary olfactory cortex (POC) could be detected in AD as well as in MCI patients and would be correlated with olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) alterations, reflecting loss of olfactory cortex activity. METHODS: Total structural volumes and fMRI activation volumes of the POC and hippocampus were measured along with olfactory and cognitive behavioral tests in 27 cognitively normal (CN), 21 MCI, and 15 AD subjects. RESULTS: Prominent atrophy in the POC and hippocampus was found in both AD and MCI subjects and correlated with behavioral measurements. While behavioral and volumetric measurements showed a gradual decline from CN to MCI to AD, olfactory activation volume in the POC and hippocampus showed a steeper decline in the MCI group compared to corresponding tissue volume, resembling the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Decline in olfactory activity was correlated with the AD structural degeneration in the POC. A more prominent olfactory activity deficit than that of behavioral and tissue volume measurements was shown in the MCI stage. Olfactory fMRI may thus provide an earlier and more sensitive measure of functional neurodegeneration in AD and MCI patients.

29134611|t|Exploring white matter microstructure and olfaction dysfunction in early parkinson disease: diffusion MRI reveals new insight.
29134611|a|Olfaction dysfunction is considered as a robust marker of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD). Measurement of olfaction function as a screening test is unsatisfactory due to long lead time interval and low specificity for detection of PD. Use of imaging markers might yield more accurate predictive values and provide bases for combined use of imaging and clinical markers for early PD. Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted on 85 de novo PD patients in and 36 healthy controls to find: first, white matter tracts with significant difference in quantitative anisotropy between PD groups with various degrees of olfaction dysfunction and second, second fibers with correlation with University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score in each group using a multiple regression analysis considering age, sex, GDS and MoCA score. Local connectomes were determined in seven of all the possible comparisons, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). PD patients with anosmia and normal olfaction had the highest number of fibers with decreased connectivity in left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral fornix, bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), bilateral cingulum, bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) and body, genu and splenium of corpus callosum (CC) (FDR = 0.0013). In multiple regression analysis, connectivity in the body, genu and splenium of CC and bilateral fornix had significant negative correlation (FDR between 0.019 and 0.083), and bilateral cingulum and MCP had significant positive correlation (FDR between 0.022 and 0.092) with UPSIT score. White matter connectivity in healthy controls could not be predicted by UPSIT score using the same model. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that microstructural degenerative changes in these areas underlie the clinical phenotype of prodromal olfaction dysfunction in PD and that diffusion parameters of these areas might be able to serve as signature markers for early detection of PD. This is the first report that confirms a discriminative role for UPSIT score in identifying PD specific changes in white matter microstructure. Our results open a window to identify microstructural signatures of prodromal PD in white matter.

26025012|t|Selective cognitive and psychiatric manifestations in Wolfram Syndrome.
26025012|a|BACKGROUND: Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is known to involve diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, vision loss, hearing impairment, motor abnormalities, and neurodegeneration, but has been less clearly linked to cognitive, sleep, and psychiatric abnormalities. We sought to determine whether these abnormalities are present in children, adolescents, and young adults with WFS compared to age- and gender-matched individuals with and without type 1 diabetes using standardized measures. METHODS: Individuals with genetically-confirmed WFS (n = 19, ages 7-27) were compared to age- and gender- equivalent groups of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; n = 25), and non-diabetic healthy controls (HC: n = 25). Cognitive performance across multiple domains (verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, memory, attention, smell identification) was assessed using standardized tests. Standardized self- and parent-report questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances were acquired from all groups and an unstructured psychiatric interview was performed within only the WFS group. RESULTS: The three groups were similar demographically (age, gender, ethnicity, parental IQ). WFS and T1DM had similar duration of diabetes but T1DM had higher HbA1C levels than WFS and as expected both groups had higher levels than HC. The WFS group was impaired on smell identification and reported sleep quality, but was not impaired in any other cognitive or self-reported psychiatric domain. In fact, the WFS group performed better than the other two groups on selected memory and attention tasks. However, based upon a clinical evaluation of only WFS patients, we found that psychiatric and behavioral problems were present and consisted primarily of anxiety and hypersomnolence. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that cognitive performance and psychological health were relatively preserved WFS patients, while smell and sleep abnormalities manifested in many of the WFS patients. These findings contradict past case and retrospective reports indicating significant cognitive and psychiatric impairment in WFS. While many of these patients were diagnosed with anxiety and hypersomnolence, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms indicated that the symptoms were not of grave concern to the patients. It may be that cognitive and psychiatric issues become more prominent later in life and/or in later stages of the disease, but this requires standardized assessment and larger samples to determine. In the relatively early stages of WFS, smell and sleep-related symptoms may be useful biomarkers of disease and should be monitored longitudinally to determine if they are good markers of progression as well.

27772753|t|Antioxidant and inflammatory biomarkers for the identification of prodromal Parkinson's disease.
27772753|a|OBJECTIVES: We explored the role of oxidative stress and inflammatory molecules as potential Parkinson (PD) biomarkers and correlated biological with non-motor abnormalities (olfactory impairment and dysautonomia), in patients with idiopathic REM behavior disorder (iRBD) (prodromal PD) and established PD. METHODS: We recruited 11 iRBD and 15 patients with idiopathic PD (Hohen&Yahr 1-3, on L-DOPA and dopamine agonists combination therapy) and 12 age- and sex-matched controls (CTRL). We measured total olfactory score (TOS), autonomic function [deep breathing (DB), lying to standing (LS) and Valsalva manoeuvre (VM) ratios], blood reduced glutathione (Br-GSH), oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (neopterin). RESULTS: Anosmia was similarly prevalent in iRBD (36%) and PD (33%) patients, but absent in CTRL. Orthostatic hypotension was more common among iRBD (73%) and PD (60%) than in CTRL (25%). By univariable ordinal logistic regression, TOS, Br-GSH, LS and VM ratio worsened from CTRL to iRBD and PD groups. Only reduced Br-GSH levels (p=0.037, OR=0.994; 95%CI 0.988-1.000) were independently associated to PD. TOS correlated with Br-GSH (R=0.34, p=0.037), VM ratio (R=0.43, p=0.015), and neopterin (rho=0.39, p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced systemic antioxidant capacity is found in prodromal and overt PD and may represent, in association with olfactory loss and cardiovascular dysautonomia, a useful biomarker for an integrative, early diagnosis of PD.

24554308|t|Olfactory bulb involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.
24554308|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mild cognitive impairment heralding its progression to dementia. The neuropathologic changes of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases may involve the olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb/tract, primary olfactory cortices, and their secondary targets. Olfactory dysfunction is related to deposition of pathological proteins, alpha-synuclein, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofilament protein in these areas, featured by neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies and neurites inducing a complex cascade of molecular processes including oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and cytosolic disruption of cellular processes leading to cell death. Damage to cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems is likely involved, since such damage is most marked in those diseases with severe anosmia. Recent studies of olfactory dysfunction have focused its potential as an early biomarker for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders and their disease progression. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on neuropathological and pathophysiological changes of the olfactory system in the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD and synucleinopathies. We also present neuropathological findings in the olfactory bulb and tract in a large autopsy cohort (n = 536, 57.8 % female, mean age 81.3 years). The severity of olfactory bulb HPtau, Abeta, and alphaSyn pathology correlated and increased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing neuritic Braak stages, Thal Abeta phases, and cerebral Lewy body pathology, respectively. Hence, further studies are warranted to investigate the potential role of olfactory biopsies (possibly restricted to the olfactory epithelium) in the diagnostic process of neurodegenerative diseases in particular in clinical drug trials to identify subjects showing early, preclinical stages of neurodegeneration and to stratify clinically impaired cohorts according to the underlying cerebral neuropathology.

38580172|t|Potential Convergence of Olfactory Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease and COVID-19: The Role of Neuroinflammation.
38580172|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that affects 7-10 million individuals worldwide. A common early symptom of PD is olfactory dysfunction (OD), and more than 90% of PD patients suffer from OD. Recent studies have highlighted a high incidence of OD in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review investigates the potential convergence of OD in PD and COVID-19, particularly focusing on the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation contributes to OD and neurological events. Starting from our fundamental understanding of the olfactory bulb, we summarize the clinical features of OD and pathological features of the olfactory bulb from clinical cases and autopsy reports in PD patients. We then examine SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory bulb neuropathology and OD and emphasize the SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammatory cascades potentially leading to PD manifestations. By activating microglia and astrocytes, as well as facilitating the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to the onset or exacerbation of PD. We also discuss the possible contributions of NF-kappaB, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the JAK/STAT, p38 MAPK, TLR4, IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 and cGAS-STING signaling pathways. Although olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 may be reversible, it is challenging to restore OD in patients with PD. With the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and the recurrence of infections, we call for continued attention to the intersection between PD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially from the perspective of OD.

30007334|t|Diagnostic Accuracy, Item Analysis and Age Effects of the UPSIT Spanish Version in Parkinson's Disease.
30007334|a|OBJECTIVE: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is the most commonly used test to detect olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the cut-off score for clinical purposes is often difficult to establish because of age and sex effects. The current work aims to study the sensitivity and specificity of the UPSIT Spanish version and its accuracy in discriminating PD patients at different age groups from healthy controls (HC), and to perform an item analysis. METHOD: Ninety-seven non-demented PD patients and 65 HC were assessed with the UPSIT Spanish version. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for PD were calculated. Multiple regression analysis was used to define predictors of UPSIT scores. RESULTS: Using the normative cut-off score for anosmia (<=18), the UPSIT showed a sensitivity of 54.6% with a specificity of 100.0% for PD. We found that, using the UPSIT cut-off score of <=25, sensitivity was 81.4% and specificity 84.6% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.908). Diagnosis and age were good predictors of UPSIT scores (B = -10.948; p < .001; B = -0.203; p < .001). When optimal cut-off scores were considered according to age ranges (<=60, 61-70, and >=71), sensitivity and specificity values were >80.0% for all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the Spanish UPSIT version, sensitivity and specificity are improved when specific cut-off scores for different age groups are computed.

35894511|t|COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?
35894511|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a hallmark symptom of COVID-19 disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The cause of the sudden and usually temporary anosmia that most people suffer from COVID-19 is likely entirely peripheral-inflammation and other damage caused by the virus in the sensory epithelium inside the upper recesses of the nasal cavity can damage or prevent chemicals from properly activating the olfactory sensory neurons. However, persistent olfactory dysfunction from COVID-19, in the form of hyposmia and parosmia (decreased or altered smell) may affect as many as 15 million people worldwide. This epidemic of olfactory dysfunction is thus a continuing public health concern. Mounting evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself or inflammation from the immune response in the nasal sensory epithelium may invade the olfactory bulb, likely via non-neuronal transmission. COVID-19-related long-term olfactory dysfunction and early damage to olfactory and limbic brain regions suggest a pattern of degeneration similar to that seen in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia. Thus, long-term olfactory dysfunction coupled with cognitive and emotional disturbance from COVID-19 may be the first signs of delayed onset dementia from neurodegeneration. Few treatments are known to be effective to prevent further degeneration, but the first line of defense against degeneration may be olfactory and environmental enrichment. There is a pressing need for more research on treatments for olfactory dysfunction and longitudinal studies including cognitive and olfactory function from patients who have recovered from even mild COVID-19.NEW & NOTEWORTHY More than 15 million people worldwide experience persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, possibly caused by olfactory bulb damage. SARS-CoV-2 can cause inflammation and viral invasion of the olfactory bulb, initiating a cascade of degeneration similar to Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease. People who have had even mild cases of COVID-19 show signs of degeneration in cortical areas connected with the olfactory system. These data suggest a wave of post-COVID dementia in the coming decades.

16170073|t|Anosmia is very common in the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease.
16170073|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory abnormalities are reported in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Anosmia appears to be common in dementia with Lewy bodies but not in pure Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anosmia improves discrimination between the Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease and "pure" Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: 106 cases of necropsy confirmed pure Alzheimer's disease (n = 89) or LBV (n = 17) were reviewed. All had received butanol odour threshold testing. Anosmia was defined as a score < or = 1.0 on a 0-9 point scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to model potential predictors (for example, parkinsonism, smoking, hallucinations) of neuropathological diagnosis and anosmia. RESULTS: LBV cases had an increased prevalence of anosmia (65%) compared with Alzheimer's disease (23%; odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, p = 0.00045), or normal elderly people (6.7%). Within the dementia cases, the negative predictive value (92%) and specificity (78%) of anosmia were both good; sensitivity for detecting LBV was 65%, but the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 35%. Logistic regression models showed anosmia (OR = 5.4, p = 0.005) and visual hallucinations (OR = 7.3, p = 0.007) were strong independent predictors of Lewy body pathology. When anosmia was added as a core feature to consensus diagnostic criteria for probable Lewy body dementia, five additional cases of LBV were detected (29% increased sensitivity), but with four additional false positives (1% increased discrimination, 4% decreased specificity, 33% decreased PPV). CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia is very common in LBV. Adding anosmia as a core feature improved sensitivity for detecting LBV, but did not improve discrimination between Alzheimer's disease and LBV owing to a concomitant increase in false positives.

20083801|t|Association of anosmia with autonomic failure in Parkinson disease.
20083801|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction and autonomic failure are gaining recognition as nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson disease (PD). This observational study assessed whether in PD anosmia and autonomic failure are related to each other or to neuroimaging evidence of striatal dopamine deficiency. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 23 patients with sporadic PD. Baroreflex-cardiovagal gain was quantified from the relationship between cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and baroreflex-sympathoneural function by responses of systolic pressure to the Valsalva maneuver and of hemodynamics and plasma norepinephrine (NE) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) levels to orthostasis. 6-[(18)F]Fluorodopamine PET and plasma and skeletal muscle microdialysate NE and DHPG were used to indicate cardiac and extracardiac noradrenergic innervation and brain 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa PET to indicate striatal dopaminergic innervation. Parkinsonism was assessed by UPDRS scores. RESULTS: Compared to patients with PD and normal to moderately decreased sense of smell, patients with anosmic PD had lower mean baroreflex-cardiovagal gain (p = 0.04), larger falls in systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and orthostasis (p = 0.04, p = 0.02), smaller orthostatic increments in plasma NE and DHPG (p = 0.003, p = 0.03), lower cardiac septal:hepatic and renal cortical:hepatic ratios of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity (p = 0.01, p = 0.06), and lower microdialysate NE and DHPG (p = 0.01; p = 0.006). Neither clinical severity of parkinsonism nor the putamen:occipital cortex ratio of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa-derived radioactivity was related to the UPSIT category. CONCLUSIONS: In Parkinson disease, anosmia is associated with baroreflex failure and cardiac and organ-selective extracardiac noradrenergic denervation, independently of parkinsonism or striatal dopaminergic denervation.
