Olfactory dysfunction is a potential early indicator of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinsonâ€™s (Sommer et al., 2004).

Automated extraction of smell loss and neurodegenerative disease information could speed up the process of identifying medically relevant connections.

Our goal is to create a knowledge base of olfactory dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease associations.
