12671941|t|Olfaction in neurodegenerative disorder.
12671941|a|There has been an increase of interest in olfactory dysfunction since it was realised that anosmia was a common feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer-type dementia (AD). It is an intriguing possibility that the first sign of a disorder hitherto regarded as one of movement or cognition may be that of disturbed smell sense. In this review of PD, parkinsonian syndromes, essential tremor, AD, motor neurone disease (MND) and Huntington's chorea (HC) the following observations are made: 1). olfactory dysfunction is frequent and often severe in PD and AD; 2). normal smell identification in PD is rare and should prompt review of diagnosis unless the patient is female with tremor-dominant disease; 3). anosmia in suspected progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration is atypical and should likewise provoke diagnostic review; 4). hyposmia is an early feature of PD and AD and may precede motor and cognitive signs respectively; 5). subjects with anosmia and one ApoE-4 allele have an approximate 5-fold increased risk of later AD; 6). impaired smell sense is seen in some patients at 50% risk of parkinsonism; 7). smell testing in HC and MND where abnormality may be found, is not likely to be of clinical value; and 8). biopsy of olfactory nasal neurons shows non-specific changes in PD and AD and at present will not aid diagnosis.

26003671|t|Olfaction deterioration in cognitive disorders in the elderly.
26003671|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases are widespread neurodegenerative pathologies. Parkinson's disease affects about 1 % of the population over the age of 65 years, while Alzheimer is considered the most common cause of dementia, with an annual incidence of 1 % in persons aged 65 years. It has been demonstrated that both these neurodegenerative diseases are associated with smell dysfunction. AIM: The aim of the present review is to describe briefly modern olfactory evaluation tools as well as the importance of olfactory sensitivity screening in the elderly, especially where cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, are suspected. METHODS: A brief literature review focusing on the basic principle of smell tests is illustrated together with their application in elderly patients affected by cognitive disorders, in particular Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are both neurodegenerative disorders typically found in the elderly. As both diseases are characterized by the early presence of dysosmia, simple validated smell tests could very well help clinicians in the early diagnosis of these neuropathological conditions. Elderly patients complaining of smell loss and found to be dysosmic, by means of validated olfactory tests, should be neurologically evaluated as early as possible to detect slight motor abnormalities in an at-risk population.

28802932|t|Anosmia and Ageusia in Parkinson's Disease.
28802932|a|Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, is a common nonmotor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Ageusia, the loss of sense of taste, is additionally an underappreciated nonmotor feature of PD. The olfactory tract is involved early in PD as indicated by frequent occurrence of hyposmia or anosmia years or decades before motor symptoms and by autopsy studies showing early synuclein pathology in the olfactory tract and anterior olfactory nucleus even in the early stages of PD. Testing for olfaction consists of evaluation of olfactory thresholds, smell identification and discrimination, and olfactory memory. Testing for gustation involves evaluating thresholds and discrimination of five basic tastes (salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami). The presence of a specific pattern of loss in both olfaction and gustation in PD has been proposed, but this has not yet been confirmed. Within PD, olfactory loss is strongly tied with cognitive status though links to other features of PD or a particular PD phenotype is debated. Hyposmia is more often present and typically more severe in PD patients than other parkinsonian syndromes, making it a potentially useful biomarker for the disease.

31291631|t|Olfactory Identification among Various Subtypes of Parkinson Disease.
31291631|a|INTRODUCTION: This study is aimed at investigating the olfactory function among different subtypes of Parkinson disease (PD) and the impact of sex on smell identification test. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used Iran-smell identification test (Iran-SIT). PD severity was determined using a Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) scale. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the olfactory function among different PD subtypes. All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 16.0. RESULTS: In total, 66 males and 38 females participated in this study. The most common PD subtype was postural instability and gait difficulty (38.5%). Severe hyposmia and anosmia were found in 44.6 and 19.6% of participants, respectively. Women had a higher score in olfactory function than men (p = 0.44). The score of subjects with stage 1 in the H&amp;Y scale was about 3 points higher than the score with stage 4. The ANCOVA showed a statistically significant effect of subtypes PD on Iran-SIT score after controlling for the effects of covariates (p = 0.03). There is a significant difference between tremor-dominant Parkinson disease (TDPD) and other subtypes of PD (p < 0.05). However, Iran-SIT scores failed to show a significant difference between men and women (p = 0.13). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that PD is heterogeneous and there is significant variability in odor identification ability in these patients. We observed more olfactory impairment in TDPD, and subjects with higher H&amp;Y stage. We recommended future studies with repeated measurements of different aspects of smell function to characterize the temporal relationship of olfactory dysfunction with PD.

33417193|t|Neurological features and outcome in COVID-19: dementia can predict severe disease.
33417193|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 22 million people worldwide. Although much has been learned about COVID-19, we do not know much about its neurological features and their outcome. This observational study was conducted on the patients of Imam Hossein Hospital, and 361 adult patients (214 males) with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 5, 2020 to April 3, 2020, were enrolled. Data was gathered on age, sex, comorbidities, initial symptoms, symptoms during the disease course, neurological symptoms, and outcome. The mean age of the patients was 61.90 +- 16.76 years. The most common initial symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. In 21 patients (5.8%), the initial symptom was neurological. History of dementia was associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio = 1.28). During the course of the disease, 186 patients (51.52%) had at least one neurological symptom, the most common being headache (109 [30.2%]), followed by anosmia/ageusia (69, [19.1%]), and dizziness (54, [15%]). Also, 31 patients had neurological complications (8.58%). Anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, and headache were associated with favorable outcome (P < 0.001), while altered mental status and hemiparesis were associated with poor outcome. The mortality rate of patients who had neurological complications was more than twice than that of patients without neurological complication (P = 0.008). Almost half of the patients experienced at least one neurological symptom, which may be the initial presentation of COVID-19. Dementia appears to be associated with severe COVID-19. Mortality was higher in patients with neurological complications, and these patients needed more intensive care.

34086764|t|Is either anosmia or constipation associated with cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease?
34086764|a|OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association of anosmia or constipation with cognitive dysfunction and disease severity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with PD (less than 5 years) without a clinical diagnosis of dementia were included from February 2017 to August 2018. The subjects were further divided into subgroups based on whether anosmia occurred and the grade of constipation. The severity of PD motor symptoms was rated using the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), and cognitive functions were evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical analyses including t-tests, chi-square tests, multiple linear regression, and binary logistic regression were used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 107 newly diagnosed PD patients were included in this study. The MoCA score was significantly lower in the anosmia group (p < 0.001). Constipation was associated with impaired olfaction in a post-hoc test. The correlation coefficient between MoCA and UPSIT score was 0.41 (p < 0.001). Total anosmia and age were associated with cognitive dysfunction (MoCA < 26) (odds ratio, 2.63, p = 0.003; 1.10, p < 0.001, respectively). The anosmia group had a higher MDS-UPDRS part 3 score with beta coefficient of 7.30 (p = 0.02). Furthermore, grade 3 constipation was associated with a higher MDS-UPDRS total score with beta coefficient of 14.88 (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia but not constipation was associated with cognitive impairment in PD patients. Nevertheless, severe constipation was associated with impaired olfaction and PD disease severity. We suggest that the propagation of alpha-synuclein from the olfactory route is distinct from the enteric nervous system, but the intercommunication between these two routes is complex.

34325072|t|Olfactory dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
34325072|a|Alterations in olfactory functions are proposed to be early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Many neurodegenerative diseases are age-related, including two of the most common, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The establishment of biomarkers that promote early risk identification is critical for the implementation of early treatment to postpone or avert pathological development. Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is seen in 90% of early-stage PD patients and 85% of patients with early-stage AD, which makes it an attractive biomarker for early diagnosis of these diseases. Here, we systematically review widely applied smelling tests available for humans as well as olfaction assessments performed in some animal models and the relationships between OD and normal aging, PD, AD, and other conditions. The utility of OD as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and future research directions are also discussed.

35679630|t|Olfaction and apathy in early idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
35679630|a|BACKGROUND: Apathy remains a disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) with limited therapeutic success. Processing of emotions and smell share neuroanatomical and evolutionary pathways. OBJECTIVES: To explore the association of apathy with smell dysfunction (SD) in early PD. METHODS: We analyzed patients with de-novo PD, with follow-up of at least 5 years from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. SD and apathy were defined using University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and MDS-UPDRS part 1A. Odds ratios were calculated between apathy and olfaction groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was grouped by presence/ absence of smell dysfunction. The Log Rank test was used to compare time to apathy. RESULTS: We found no association between presence of apathy in patients with and without SD (OR 1.01 [0.49-2.08]). There was no significant difference between PD patients with and without SD in time to apathy (p = 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: SD does not portend greater risk of apathy in PD.

35894511|t|COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?
35894511|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a hallmark symptom of COVID-19 disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The cause of the sudden and usually temporary anosmia that most people suffer from COVID-19 is likely entirely peripheral-inflammation and other damage caused by the virus in the sensory epithelium inside the upper recesses of the nasal cavity can damage or prevent chemicals from properly activating the olfactory sensory neurons. However, persistent olfactory dysfunction from COVID-19, in the form of hyposmia and parosmia (decreased or altered smell) may affect as many as 15 million people worldwide. This epidemic of olfactory dysfunction is thus a continuing public health concern. Mounting evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself or inflammation from the immune response in the nasal sensory epithelium may invade the olfactory bulb, likely via non-neuronal transmission. COVID-19-related long-term olfactory dysfunction and early damage to olfactory and limbic brain regions suggest a pattern of degeneration similar to that seen in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia. Thus, long-term olfactory dysfunction coupled with cognitive and emotional disturbance from COVID-19 may be the first signs of delayed onset dementia from neurodegeneration. Few treatments are known to be effective to prevent further degeneration, but the first line of defense against degeneration may be olfactory and environmental enrichment. There is a pressing need for more research on treatments for olfactory dysfunction and longitudinal studies including cognitive and olfactory function from patients who have recovered from even mild COVID-19.NEW & NOTEWORTHY More than 15 million people worldwide experience persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, possibly caused by olfactory bulb damage. SARS-CoV-2 can cause inflammation and viral invasion of the olfactory bulb, initiating a cascade of degeneration similar to Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease. People who have had even mild cases of COVID-19 show signs of degeneration in cortical areas connected with the olfactory system. These data suggest a wave of post-COVID dementia in the coming decades.

36341691|t|Anosmia, mild cognitive impairment, and biomarkers of brain aging in older adults.
36341691|a|Olfactory impairment is a potential marker for prodromal dementia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This population-based study included 4214 dementia-free participants (age >=65 years). Olfaction was assessed using the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test. In the subsamples, we measured plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)40, Abeta42, total tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL; n = 1054); and quantified hippocampal, entorhinal cortex, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-signature cortical thickness (n = 917). Data were analyzed with logistic and linear regression models. In the total sample, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed in 1102 persons (26.2%; amnestic MCI, n = 931; non-amnestic MCI, n = 171). Olfactory impairment was significantly associated with increased likelihoods of MCI, amnestic MCI, and non-amnestic MCI. In the subsamples, anosmia was significantly associated with higher plasma total tau and NfL concentrations, smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes, and greater WMH volume, and marginally with lower AD-signature cortical thickness. These results suggest that cerebral neurodegenerative and microvascular lesions are common neuropathologies linking anosmia with MCI in older adults.

36342675|t|Widening the Spectrum of Risk Factors, Comorbidities, and Prodromal Features of Parkinson Disease.
36342675|a|Importance: The prodromal phase of Parkinson disease (PD) may last for more than 10 years. Recognition of the spectrum and occurrence of risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal features of PD can increase understanding of the causes and development of the disease and help identify individuals at risk. Objective: To identify the association of a subsequent diagnosis of PD with a range of risk factors and prodromal features, including lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and potential extracerebral manifestations of PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a case-control study using insurance claims of outpatient consultations of patients with German statutory health insurance between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020. Included were patients with incident diagnosis of PD without a previous diagnosis of parkinsonism or dementia and controls matched 1:2 for age, sex, region, and earliest year of outpatient encounter. Exposures: Exposures were selected based on previous systematic reviews, case-control and cohort studies reporting on risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal features of PD. Main Outcomes and Measures: Previously postulated risk factors and prodromal features of PD, using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding. Results: A total of 138 345 patients with incident PD (mean [SD] age, 75.1 [9.8] years; 73 720 male [53.3%]) and 276 690 matched controls (mean [SD] age, 75.1 (9.8) years; 147 440 male [53.3%]) were identified. Study participants were followed up for a mean (SD) of 6.0 (2.0) years. Consistent with previous reports, risk factors and prodromal features associated with PD included traumatic brain injury, odds ratio (OR), 1.62; 95% CI, 1.36-1.92; alcohol misuse, OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.44; hypertension, OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.26-1.31; anosmia, OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.59-2.93; and parasomnias (including RBD), OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84. In addition, there were associations with restless legs syndrome (OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 3.91-4.50), sleep apnea (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37-1.54), epilepsy (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 2.07-2.46), migraine (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.29), bipolar disorder (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 3.11-4.67), and schizophrenia (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 3.82-5.25). The following diagnoses were also found to be associated with PD: sensory impairments beyond anosmia, such as hearing loss (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20) and changes of skin sensation (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.43). There were also positive associations with skin disorders (eg, seborrheic dermatitis, OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15-1.46; psoriasis, OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21), gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25-1.33; gastritis, OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.33), conditions with a potential inflammatory component (eg, seronegative osteoarthritis, OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43), and diabetes types 1 (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.43) and 2 (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.27). Associations even 5 to 10 years before diagnosis included tremor (odds ratio [OR], 4.49; 95% CI, 3.98-5.06), restless legs syndrome (OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 3.39-4.09), bipolar disorder (OR, 3.80; 95% CI, 2.82-5.14), and schizophrenia (OR, 4.00; 95% CI, 3.31-4.85). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this case-control study suggest that the associations found between PD and certain risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal symptoms in a representative population may reflect possible early extrastriatal and extracerebral pathology of PD. This may be due to shared genetic risk with PD, medication exposure, or direct causation, or represent pathophysiologically relevant factors contributing to the pathogenesis of PD.

36689643|t|Markers of olfactory dysfunction and progression to dementia: A 12-year population-based study.
36689643|a|INTRODUCTION: We evaluated markers of olfactory dysfunction (OD) for estimating hazard of dementia in older adults. METHODS: Mild (hyposmia) and severe (anosmia) OD was classified in a population-based study of dementia-free persons (SNAC-K; n = 2473; mean age = 70 years) using the Sniffin sticks odor identification task. Combined variables were created for objective and subjective OD and for OD and APOE status. Hazard of dementia across 12 years was estimated with Cox regression. RESULTS: OD was associated with increased hazard of dementia (2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60-2.52), with the strongest association for anosmia (2.92; 95% CI 2.14-3.98). Results remained consistent after adjusting for potential confounders and across age and sex subgroups. APOE epsilon4 carriers with anosmia had the highest hazard of dementia (epsilon4: 6.95; 95% CI 4.16-11.62; epsilon4/epsilon4: 19.84; 95% CI 6.17-63.78). DISCUSSION: OD is associated with increased risk of dementia, especially severe impairment in combination with genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease.

38098019|t|Human-derived air-liquid interface cultures decipher Alzheimer's disease-SARS-CoV-2 crosstalk in the olfactory mucosa.
38098019|a|BACKGROUND: The neurological effects of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) raise concerns about potential long-term consequences, such as an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation and other AD-associated pathologies are also suggested to increase the risk of serious SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anosmia is a common neurological symptom reported in COVID-19 and in early AD. The olfactory mucosa (OM) is important for the perception of smell and a proposed site of viral entry to the brain. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 infection at the OM of individuals with AD. METHODS: To address this gap, we established a 3D in vitro model of the OM from primary cells derived from cognitively healthy and AD individuals. We cultured the cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to study SARS-CoV-2 infection under controlled experimental conditions. Primary OM cells in ALI expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and several other known SARS-CoV-2 receptor and were highly vulnerable to infection. Infection was determined by secreted viral RNA content and confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) in the infected cells by immunocytochemistry. Differential responses of healthy and AD individuals-derived OM cells to SARS-CoV-2 were determined by RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Results indicate that cells derived from cognitively healthy donors and individuals with AD do not differ in susceptibility to infection with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, transcriptomic signatures in cells from individuals with AD are highly distinct. Specifically, the cells from AD patients that were infected with the virus showed increased levels of oxidative stress, desensitized inflammation and immune responses, and alterations to genes associated with olfaction. These results imply that individuals with AD may be at a greater risk of experiencing severe outcomes from the infection, potentially driven by pre-existing neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The study sheds light on the interplay between AD pathology and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altered transcriptomic signatures in AD cells may contribute to unique symptoms and a more severe disease course, with a notable involvement of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to enhance outcomes for AD patients with viral infection. The study is crucial to better comprehend the relationship between AD, COVID-19, and anosmia. It highlights the importance of ongoing research to develop more effective treatments for those at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

38430690|t|Longitudinal brain changes in Parkinson's disease with severe olfactory deficit.
38430690|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are associated with distinct cognitive trajectories in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying neurobiology for this relationship remains unclear but may involve distinct patterns of neurodegeneration. This study aimed to examine longitudinal cortical atrophy and thinning in early-stage PD with severe olfactory deficit (anosmia) without and with concurrent probable RBD. METHODS: Longitudinal MRI data over four years of 134 de novo PD and 49 healthy controls (HC) from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) cohort were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Patients were categorized into those with anosmia by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score <= 18 (AO+) and those without (UPSIT score > 18, AO-). The AO+ group was further subdivided into AO+ with probable RBD (AO+RBD+) and without (AO+RBD-) for subanalysis. RESULTS: Compared to subjects without baseline anosmia, the AO+ group exhibited greater longitudinal declines in both volume and thickness in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri and right transverse temporal gyrus. Patients with concurrent anosmia and RBD showed more extensive longitudinal declines in cortical volume and thickness, involving additional brain regions including the bilateral precuneus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right paracentral gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: The atrophy/thinning patterns in early-stage PD with severe olfactory dysfunction include regions that are critical for cognitive function and could provide a structural basis for previously reported associations between severe olfactory deficit and cognitive decline in PD. Concurrent RBD might enhance the dynamics of cortical changes.

10627864|t|Is Parkinson's disease a primary olfactory disorder?
10627864|a|It has been known for over 30 years that olfactory function is disordered in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The severity and partial specificity of anosmia was not realized until recently, with the advent of more detailed analysis and sophisticated measurement. The olfactory vector hypothesis suggests that the causative agent for IPD enters the brain via the nasal route, but the reason for olfactory dysfunction may be more subtle. Evidence for olfactory disturbance is reviewed from pathological, psychological, neurophysiological and genetic stand-points. It is proposed that the initial causative event in IPD may start in the rhinencephalon (olfactory brain) prior to damage in the basal ganglia.

22094386|t|Olfactory deficits induce neurofilament hyperphosphorylation.
22094386|a|Olfactory dysfunction, including structural abnormalities of the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb and the central olfactory cortices is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in aged population characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). How olfactory deficits are linked with AD-like neuropathological changes is still unknown. Here, by using two anosmia animal models, bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) rats and Cnga2(-/Y) mice, which lack intact olfactory CNG channels, we found the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated neurofilament (NF) are highly increased in the neurites at both the hippocampus and the cortex. As hyperphosphorylated NF is one of the main components of NFTs, our study strongly suggested the underlying correlation of olfactory deficits with AD-like pathological impairments.

28644998|t|Olfactory identification deficit predicts white matter tract impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
28644998|a|Olfactory identification deficit (OID) has been associated with both aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the context of an amnestic disorders, OID predicts conversion to AD. Neuroanatomical correlates could increase specificity and sensitivity and elucidate the mechanistic differences between OID in AD and aging. Cross-sectional analysis of white matter microstructural changes was performed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tract-based-spatial-statistics in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), AD and normal controls (NC) in 66 subjects (26 AD, 15 aMCI, 25 NC). DTI 3-Tesla MRI scans were analyzed and subject level means for fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial and axial diffusivity (lambda1D and lambda2,3D) were calculated. Linear regression models were applied using DTI markers as predictor and OID as outcome. OID was associated with increased lambda1D in aMCI and increased MD, lambda1D and lambda2,3D in AD. Voxel-wise analyses revealed widespread differences in all markers in AD. There were significant differences in lambda1D in aMCI, particularly in the olfactory tract. OID is correlated with microstructural white matter changes as early as in aMCI. This study may help elucidate the biological basis for olfactory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Neuroanatomical correlates could help distinguish OID associated with AD and that associated with aging.

31177212|t|Clinical, Structural, and Neuropathological Features of Olfactory Dysfunction in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
31177212|a|We explored changes in clinical features and neuropathological mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction (OD) in 60 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory function was evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks test and a threshold discrimination identification (TDI) score. Based on the TDI score, we divided patients according to the presence or absence of OD (AD-OD and AD-NOD, respectively). Cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated by a series of rating scales. The volumes and cortical thickness of the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala were measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropathological protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid were measured. The frequency of OD was 50%. TDI scores were lower in the AD-OD group than in the AD-NOD group (p < 0.001). Compared with the AD-NOD group, the AD-OD group showed greater cognitive function impairments (p < 0.001), and daily living activities were more severely compromised (p = 0.019). The AD-OD group had lower hippocampal and amygdala volumes (p = 0.025, p = 0.030, respectively) and a more pronounced reduction in cortical thickness (p = 0.010). The total tau level was lower in the AD-OD group than the AD-NOD group (p = 0.040). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and thinner AD-signature cortices were associated with lower TDI scores (OR = 0.826, p < 0.001; OR = 1.433, p = 0.008). Overall, in AD patients, the impairments in olfactory discrimination and identification seem to be more correlated with cognitive levels. OD in AD may be an indicator of pathological cognitive decline and structural changes.

32249295|t|Orthonasal, but not Retronasal Olfaction Is Specifically Impaired in Parkinson's Disease.
32249295|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) appears several years before the presence of motor disturbance. Olfactory testing has the potential to serve as a tool for early detection of PD, but OD is not specific to PD as it affects up to 20% of the general population. Olfaction includes an orthonasal and a retronasal components; in some forms of OD, retronasal olfactory function is preserved. We aimed to evaluate whether combined testing components allows for discriminating between PD-related OD and non-Parkinsonian OD (NPOD). The objective of this study is to orthonasal and retronasal olfactory function in PD patients and compare them to a NPOD group and to healthy controls. We hypothesized that this combined testing allows to distinguish PD patients from both other groups. We included 32 PD patients, 25 NPOD patients, and 15 healthy controls. Both olfactory components were impaired in PD and NPOD patients, compared with controls; however, NPOD patients had significantly better orthonasal scores than PD patients. Furthermore, the ratio of retronasal/orthonasal score was higher in PD than in both other groups. In the NPOD group, orthonasal and retronasal scores were significantly correlated; no such correlation could be observed in PD patients. In summary, PD patients seem to rely on compensatory mechanisms for flavor perception. Combined orthonasal and retronasal olfactory testing may contribute to differentiate PD patients from patients with NPOD.

32310189|t|Olfaction in LRRK2 Linked Parkinson's Disease: Is It Different from Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease?
32310189|a|BACKGROUND: Studies on olfaction in LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease (LRRK2-PD) have yielded variable results. The impact of smell dysfunction upon daily life activities have been rarely assessed in PD. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the olfactory deficit in LRRK2-PD and its impact on daily life activities. METHODS: Twenty-four LRRK2-PD, 40 idiopathic PD (IPD), and 49 age-sex-matched controls were interviewed about olfactory characteristics and the impact of smell on daily life activities. The Barcelona Smell Identification test (BAST-24) and the Spanish-version of the 40-item University of Pennsylvania smell test (UPSIT) were applied. RESULTS: Nineteen (79.2%) LRRK2-PD patients reported subjective smell impairment with a low impact upon daily living activities. UPSIT score was higher in LRRK2-PD than in IPD (22.54+-7.98 vs 18.84+-6.03; p = 0.042). All IPD and 95.8% LRRK2-PD patients had hyposmia/anosmia, assessed by means of the UPSIT. No differences were found between LRRK2-PD and IPD regarding smell detection, memory or forced-choice identification. CONCLUSION: Most LRRK2-PD patients reported subjective smell impairment and presented hyposmia, according to validated smell tests, with a low impact of the smell dysfunction on daily life activities.

32968130|t|Is there a close association of depression with either constipation or dysosmia in Parkinson's disease?
32968130|a|A possible association between depression and either the severity of constipation or dysosmia in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients was investigated in this cross-sectional study. One-hundred six patients who had the history of PD for less than 5 years were recruited. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and our patients were divided into depressive and non-depressive groups (DP: BDI-II >= 14; n = 22 and NDP: BDI-II < 14; n = 84). Olfactory dysfunction was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Constipation severity was defined by stool softener dosage and amount. Statistical analyses with one-tailed T- or chi-squared test, odds ratios (OR), and beta-coefficient were used to determine significant differences. Total scores based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were significantly higher in the DP group. A significant relationship was observed between PD patients with depression and severe constipation; PD patients with depression were more likely to present with severe constipation (OR 5.81; 95% CI 1.24-27.29, p = 0.026, adjusted for age and gender); but the significance became marginal after adjusted for age, gender and UPDRS part 3 (OR 4.46, 95% CI 0.93-21.33; p = 0.061). However, no association between olfactory dysfunction and depression was detected. There were significant positive correlations between BDI-II scores and severe constipation (beta +- SE 7.65 +- 2.02; p =  < 0.001, adjusted for age and gender; beta +- SE 7.06 +- 2.04; p = 0.001, adjusted for age, gender, and UPDRS-3). Besides, we detected a marginally significant correlation that PD patients with higher BDI-II scores tended to present more severe motor symptoms. Olfactory dysfunction seemed to be less relevant to BDI-II scores. Based on our findings, we speculate that depression may be more closely related to brainstem nuclei than to the limbic pathway.

33293191|t|Relationship between cognitive impairment and olfactory function among older adults with olfactory impairment.
33293191|a|OBJECTIVE: Understanding the relationships among aging, cognitive function, and olfaction may be useful for diagnosing olfactory decline in older adults. Olfactory function declines in the early stage of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Aging and cognitive impairment are associated with olfactory decline. Moreover, the assessment of hyposmia and anosmia is paramount to the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to assess the relationships among aging, cognitive function, and olfaction in patients with olfactory impairment. METHODS: This observational study included 141 patients with olfactory deterioration who presented with dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), age-related hyposmia, or postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD). The patients underwent T&T olfactometry, a self-administered odor questionnaire (SAOQ), a visual analog scale (VAS), and a Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: T&T odor recognition thresholds decreased with aging (p < 0.01) and cognitive impairment (p < 0.08). The average T&T recognition thresholds were 5.1,4.6,4.2, and 3.7 in dementia, MCI, age-related hyposmia, and PVOD, respectively. Moreover, the average differences between the detection and recognition thresholds were 3.7, 2.8, 2.3, and 2.0 in dementia, MCI, age-related hyposmia, and PVOD, respectively. Hyposmia with dementia presented the highest recognition thresholds (p < 0.05) and the largest differences between the T&T detection and recognition thresholds, compared with age-related hyposmia and PVOD (p < 0.05). Hyposmia with dementia had the highest SAOQ and VAS scores compared with the other groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The possibility of dementia should be investigated in patients with hyposmia, including those with high T&T recognition thresholds, a large difference between the T&T detection and recognition thresholds, and high SAOQ and VAS scores.

33422806|t|Could COVID-19 anosmia and olfactory dysfunction trigger an increased risk of future dementia in patients with ApoE4?
33422806|a|The association of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with significant neurological and neuropsychiatric complications has been increasingly reported, both during the acute illness and in its aftermath. However, due to the short duration of patient follow up until now, it is not clear whether this infection will be associated with longer-term neurological and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. In particular, the question of whether COVID-19 will be associated with an increased risk and rate of future dementia remains open and subject to speculation. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients have reported sudden anosmia or other olfactory dysfunction as concurrent symptoms. The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may reach the brain via the olfactory nerve or an upper nasal trancribrial route is an interesting working hypothesis. Among the identified genetic risk factors for Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), Apo E4 is one of the strongest and most frequent. People carrying one or two copies of the e4 allele of Apo E4 have significant odor recognition deficits in comparison to those not carrying this haplotype. The hypothesis invoked in this paper is that anosmia/olfactory dysfunctions induced by SARS-CoV-2 may cause an increased a risk of future neurodegenerative dementia in ApoE4 carriers, and that this risk would be higher than in Apo E4 carriers affected by anosmia not induced by SARS-CoV-2. This would be associated with virus-induced chronic modifications in the central nervous system. It is proposed that COVID-19 patients with anosmia and no other serious symptoms should be followed up as part of specifically designed and approved studies in order to identify the early stages of dementia (especially LOAD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies), thereby improving our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in pre-cognitive stages of neurodegenerative dementia and making best use of any available therapies. This latter opportunity is unique and should not be lost.

33657978|t|Using the Chinese Smell Identification Test to explore olfactory function in Parkinson's disease.
33657978|a|Introduction: The Chinese Smell Identification Test (CSIT) was developed specifically for Chinese populations. This work investigated the utility of this test in detecting Parkinson's disease (PD). Olfactory dysfunction is a common non-motor symptom of PD. There are different opinions on the efficacy of drugs for anosmia in PD.Objective: To investigate the olfactory function of Chinese PD patients, verify the effectiveness of the CSIT, and further detect the effects of dopaminergic drugs on anosmia.Methods: In total, 149 PD patients were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and 149 healthy comparison participants (HCP) were recruited from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The CSIT was used for olfactory function testing in all participants.Results: CSIT scores were significantly lower in the PD group than in the HCP group (t(296) = -12.797, P < 0.001, d = 1.48). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal threshold value for the olfactory recognition test was 22.5, which had a sensitivity and specificity of 71.1% and 89.3%, respectively, for the detection of Parkinson's disease. Sex showed a significant influence on CSIT score (t = -3.552, P = 0.001), with males being more likely to develop olfactory dysfunction. We found CSIT scores of the non-medication group and the group with medication were lower than those of the HCP group, and the difference was statistically significant (t(82) = -7.116, P < 0.0167, d = 1.59; t(82) = -4.907, P < 0.0167, d = 1.10). CSIT scores of the group with medication were significantly higher than those of the non-medication group (t(41) = -3.067, P < 0.0167, d = 0.41).Conclusions: In China, the CSIT is recommended to improve the sensitivity of PD detection. The olfactory function of PD patients was improved after treatment with dopaminergic drugs.

33989761|t|COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease: Defects in neurogenesis as the potential cause of olfactory system impairments and anosmia.
33989761|a|Anosmia, a neuropathogenic condition of loss of smell, has been recognized as a key pathogenic hallmark of the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection responsible for COVID-19. While the anosmia resulting from olfactory bulb (OB) pathology is the prominent clinical characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinsonism-related symptoms in a significant portion of COVID-19 patients and survivors. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to alter the dopamine system and induce the loss of dopaminergic neurons that have been known to be the cause of PD. However, the underlying biological basis of anosmia and the potential link between COVID-19 and PD remains obscure. Ample experimental studies in rodents suggest that the occurrence of neural stem cell (NSC) mediated neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and OB is important for olfaction. Though the occurrence of neurogenesis in the human forebrain has been a subject of debate, considerable experimental evidence strongly supports the incidence of neurogenesis in the human OB in adulthood. To note, various viral infections and neuropathogenic conditions including PD with olfactory dysfunctions have been characterized by impaired neurogenesis in OB and OE. Therefore, this article describes and examines the recent reports on SARS-CoV-2 mediated OB dysfunctions and defects in the dopaminergic system responsible for PD. Further, the article emphasizes that COVID-19 and PD associated anosmia could result from the regenerative failure in the replenishment of the dopaminergic neurons in OB and olfactory sensory neurons in OE.

1992839|t|The nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
1992839|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the specific nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies had noted impaired odor identification, but there was no unanimity about the presence of odor detection deficits. METHOD: Odor identification was tested in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 57 elderly control subjects by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Odor detection was assessed in 46 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 40 control subjects by using a forced-choice threshold test with geraniol as the odorant. RESULTS: Significant deficits in olfactory identification were present in subjects who were in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment, and these deficits increased as Alzheimer's disease progressed. There was some overlap in individual smell identification test scores between cognitively impaired patients and normal elderly subjects. On the other hand, odor detection deficits did not appear until Alzheimer's disease was relatively advanced. Smell identification test scores were correlated with Mini-Mental State scores, but geraniol detection was not. CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease and may be more influenced by cognitive status than is acuity of odor detection, which is not altered until later in the disorder. The pattern of hyposmia in Alzheimer's disease suggests that the disorder may not "begin in the nose," as has been theorized previously. Further refinement of olfactory testing may be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of early dementia.

10336141|t|Loss of olfactory function in dementing disease.
10336141|a|Alzheimer's (AD) patients show neuropathological changes in areas of the brain central to olfactory processing, suggesting the theoretical importance and potential diagnostic utility of investigating functional changes in olfaction in these patients. Persons with Down's Syndrome who live to the fourth decade develop neuropathological changes in the brain similar to those found in AD. A series of investigations have been conducted to assess olfaction function in both patients with Alzheimer's disease and persons with Down's Syndrome. Functional testing included olfactory threshold, odor identification, odor similarity judgements, odor recognition memory, odor recall, odor fluency. Both Alzheimer's patients and persons with Down's Syndrome showed significant impairment in olfactory function, with some measures showing more impairment than others in the early stages of the disease process. Longitudinal investigation of several of the measures indicated decreased function over time consonant with falling DRS scores. Normal controls who tested positive for the APOE4 allele showed impaired odor identification compared to those who were allele negative. Patients with Huntington's Disease showed olfactory functional impairments, although the degree of impairment differed from the cortical dementias for some of these tasks. The sensitivity and specificity of these assessments will be discussed in relation to analogous assessments in other sensory modalities.

16170073|t|Anosmia is very common in the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease.
16170073|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory abnormalities are reported in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Anosmia appears to be common in dementia with Lewy bodies but not in pure Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anosmia improves discrimination between the Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease and "pure" Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: 106 cases of necropsy confirmed pure Alzheimer's disease (n = 89) or LBV (n = 17) were reviewed. All had received butanol odour threshold testing. Anosmia was defined as a score < or = 1.0 on a 0-9 point scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to model potential predictors (for example, parkinsonism, smoking, hallucinations) of neuropathological diagnosis and anosmia. RESULTS: LBV cases had an increased prevalence of anosmia (65%) compared with Alzheimer's disease (23%; odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, p = 0.00045), or normal elderly people (6.7%). Within the dementia cases, the negative predictive value (92%) and specificity (78%) of anosmia were both good; sensitivity for detecting LBV was 65%, but the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 35%. Logistic regression models showed anosmia (OR = 5.4, p = 0.005) and visual hallucinations (OR = 7.3, p = 0.007) were strong independent predictors of Lewy body pathology. When anosmia was added as a core feature to consensus diagnostic criteria for probable Lewy body dementia, five additional cases of LBV were detected (29% increased sensitivity), but with four additional false positives (1% increased discrimination, 4% decreased specificity, 33% decreased PPV). CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia is very common in LBV. Adding anosmia as a core feature improved sensitivity for detecting LBV, but did not improve discrimination between Alzheimer's disease and LBV owing to a concomitant increase in false positives.

19047559|t|Is olfactory impairment in Parkinson disease related to phenotypic or genotypic characteristics?
19047559|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between olfactory impairment (OI) and other impairment domains in Parkinson disease (PD) and the characteristics of OI in patients with certain genotypic characteristics. METHODS: In 295 nondemented patients with PD and 150 controls with a similar overall age and sex distribution, olfactory function was evaluated with the identification (ID) and discrimination (DIS) tests of the Sniffin' Sticks. In patients, demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated, and genetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of all patients, 61% had an impaired ID and 43% had an impaired DIS. No significant correlations >0.4 were found between olfactory scores and other demographic or clinical variables. Age and sex accounted for the 22% explained variance of the ID score regression model, whereas age, sex, and disease duration accounted for the 15% explained variance of the DIS score regression model. Parkin and DJ-1 mutation carriers (homozygous or heterozygous compound, n = 6) had normal ID scores. APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 carriers had no significantly different olfactory scores than noncarriers. The allele distribution of the alpha-synuclein (SNCA)-REP1 polymorphism in groups with an impaired or normal ID or DIS was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory impairment (OI) in Parkinson disease (PD) may be unrelated to other impairment domains of the disease, which may indicate that olfaction is an independent feature of PD. Parkin and DJ-1 mutation carriers had normal identification scores but the number of mutation carriers is too small to draw conclusions. The APOE genotype (APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 alleles) and SNCA-REP1 polymorphism do not seem to influence olfaction in PD.

20084814|t|Ageing, neurodegeneration, and olfactory and gustatory loss.
20084814|a|Olfactory and gustatory disorders increase with advancing age. Moreover, olfactory disorders are common in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since the decrease in olfactory function is usually gradual, it often remains undetected. Given the poor self-assessment of olfactory function, olfactory testing is mandatory in suspected cases to establish the diagnosis of hyposmia or anosmia. The high rate of anosmia over the age of 70 is suspected to be due to several factors such as changes in the olfactory epithelium (reduced mucus secretion, hormonal changes, changes in epithelial thickness, for example), and the reduced neuroregeneration rate in olfactory receptor cells themselves. There is no known adequate treatment for stopping or reversing this age-related decline in olfaction. In IPD, olfactory impairment precedes motor symptoms by years and is independent of dopaminergic loss. Using fMRI, altered neuronal activity in the amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation during olfactory stimulation have been demonstrated, as has a link between the expression of olfactory event-related potentials and olfactory-induced brain activity. In AD--by contrast with IPD--the severity of the disease and the olfactory disorder correlate. The olfactory disorders alone, however, cannot distinguish between AD and IPD. A complete loss of gustatory function is rare, while dysgeusia is common, especially with increasing age. There are multiple possible explanations, including concomitant disease and the side-effects of medication. These need to be established on the basis of exact history and examination. Treatment remains difficult.

28919173|t|Trigeminal system in Parkinson's disease: A potential avenue to detect Parkinson-specific olfactory dysfunction.
28919173|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is very frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and observed years before diagnosis. The trigeminal system, a chemosensory system allowing for the perception of spiciness, freshness, etc., is intimately connected to the olfactory system and although usually reduced in OD the trigeminal system is not well characterized in PD. We hypothesize that measuring trigeminal sensitivity potentially allows to discriminate between OD due to PD and OD due to other causes to potentially help the development of an early diagnostic tool. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate olfactory and trigeminal sensitivity and perception in PD patients and compare them to participants with non-parkinsonian OD (NPOD) and to healthy controls. METHODS: We assessed olfactory function using "Sniffin' Sticks test" and trigeminal function with the localization task in 28 PD patients, 27 healthy controls and 21 patients with OD unrelated to PD. RESULTS: PD patients exhibited significantly higher trigeminal sensitivity than NPOD patients (p = 0.002) and performed similar to healthy controls. In contrast, PD and NPOD patients had both similar olfactory scores, significantly below healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The trigeminal system seems not to be impaired in PD patients even in the presence of OD. Measuring trigeminal sensitivity may therefore allow to differentiate PD-related OD from other forms of OD.

33843686|t|Olfactory Phenotypes Differentiate Cognitively Unimpaired Seniors from Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Combined Machine Learning and Traditional Statistical Approach.
33843686|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, olfactory testing is not commonly performed to test OD in the setting of AD. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates objective OD as a non-invasive biomarker for accurately classifying subjects as cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. METHODS: Patients with MCI (n = 24) and AD (n = 24), and CU (n = 33) controls completed two objective tests of olfaction (Affordable, Rapid, Olfactory Measurement Array -AROMA; Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 Test -SST12). Demographic and subjective sinonasal and olfaction symptom information was also obtained. Analyses utilized traditional statistics and machine learning to determine olfactory variables, and combinations of variables, of importance for differentiating normal and disease states. RESULTS: Inability to correctly identify a scent after detection was a hallmark of MCI/AD. AROMA was superior to SST12 for differentiating MCI from AD. Performance on the clove scent was significantly different between all three groups. AROMA regression modeling yielded six scents with AUC of the ROC of 0.890 (p < 0.001). Random forest model machine learning algorithms considering AROMA olfactory data successfully predicted MCI versus AD disease state. Considering only AROMA data, machine learning algorithms were 87.5%accurate (95%CI 0.4735, 0.9968). Sensitivity and specificity were 100%and 75%, respectively with ROC of 0.875. When considering AROMA and subject demographic and subjective data, the AUC of the ROC increased to 0.9375. CONCLUSION: OD differentiates CUs from those with MCI and AD and can accurately predict MCI versus AD. Leveraging OD data may meaningfully guide management and research decisions.

34180422|t|Slow Motion Analysis of Repetitive Tapping (SMART) Test: Measuring Bradykinesia in Recently Diagnosed Parkinson's Disease and Idiopathic Anosmia.
34180422|a|BACKGROUND: Bradykinesia is the defining motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). There are limitations to its assessment using standard clinical rating scales, especially in the early stages of PD when a floor effect may be observed. OBJECTIVE: To develop a quantitative method to track repetitive tapping movements and to compare people in the early stages of PD, healthy controls, and individuals with idiopathic anosmia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 99 participants (early-stage PD = 26, controls = 64, idiopathic anosmia = 9). For each participant, repetitive finger tapping was recorded over 20 seconds using a smartphone at 240 frames per second. From each video, amplitude between fingers, frequency (number of taps per second), and velocity (distance travelled per second) was extracted. Clinical assessment was based on the motor section of the MDS-UPDRS. RESULTS: People in the early stage of PD performed the task with slower velocity (p < 0.001) and with greater frequency slope than controls (p = 0.003). The combination of reduced velocity and greater frequency slope obtained the best accuracy to separate early-stage PD from controls based on metric thresholds alone (AUC = 0.88). Individuals with anosmia exhibited slower velocity (p = 0.001) and smaller amplitude (p < 0.001) compared with controls. CONCLUSION: We present a simple, proof-of-concept method to detect early motor dysfunction in PD. Mean tap velocity appeared to be the best parameter to differentiate patients with PD from controls. Patients with anosmia also showed detectable differences in motor performance compared with controls which may suggest that some were in the prodromal phase of PD.

35767550|t|Odor identification predicts the transition of patients with isolated RBD: A retrospective study.
35767550|a|INTRODUCTION: To determine if the severity of olfactory dysfunction in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) predicts conversion to Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: Olfaction was tested using the Japanese version of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-J) in 155 consecutive patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD and 34 healthy controls. IRBD patients were followed up for 5.8 +- 3.2 (range 0.2-11) years. Thirty-eight patients underwent repeat UPSIT-J evaluation at 2.7 +- 1.3 years after the baseline test. RESULTS: UPSIT-J score was lower in IRBD patients than in age- and sex-matched controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cutoff score of 22.5 in UPSIT-J discriminated between IRBD patients and controls with a sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 81.8%. Anosmia (UPSIT-J score < 19) was present in 54.2% of IRBD patients. In total, 42 patients developed a neurodegenerative disease, of whom 17 had PD, 22 DLB, and 3 MSA. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the short-term risk of Lewy body disease (LBD) was higher in patients with anosmia than in those without anosmia. At baseline, the UPSIT-J score was similar between patients who developed PD and DLB (p = 0.136). All three IRBD patients (100%) who developed MSA did not have anosmia. CONCLUSIONS: In IRBD patients, anosmia predicts a higher short-term risk of transition to LBD but cannot distinguish between PD and DLB. At baseline, preserved odor identification may occur in latent MSA. Future IRBD neuroprotective trials should evaluate anosmia as a marker of prodromal LBD.

37258792|t|Identifying the potential role of serum miR-20a as a biomarker for olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease.
37258792|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction (OD), one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), is a cardinal prodromal symptom that can appear years before the onset of motor symptoms. Ongoing studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are suitable biomarkers for PD, while there is a lack of robust miRNAs that can serve as markers for OD in PD. METHODS: The concordantly differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in the damaged olfactory system were first identified in 2 OD-related Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Then, they were verified in another PD-related GEO dataset and only one miRNA (miR-20a) was found to be significantly altered. Serum levels of miR-20a were further measured by qPCR in 79 PD patients with OD (PD-OD), 52 PD patients without OD (PD-NOD), and 52 healthy controls (HC). Objective measure of OD was defined by 16-item Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test. All the participants underwent a demographic and comprehensive PD-related clinical assessment. RESULTS: Our results proved that miR-20a was significantly downregulated in PD-OD compared with PD-NOD and the area under curve (AUC) for OD detection by miR-20a was 0.803 (95% confidence interval, 0.724-0.883). In addition, PD-OD had higher scores of Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, Hoehn and Yahr stage (H-Y), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3, NMSS 5, NMSS 9, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Activity of Daily Living (ADL), and lower scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 39-item PD Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) than PD-NOD. Binary regression model further presented that lower expressions of miR-20a and poorer cognitive function acted as promoting factors in the development of OD. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-20a could be a novel biomarker for OD in PD and PD-OD patients tend to have higher disease stage, poorer motor aspects of experiences of daily living, worse cognitive scores, and inferior quality of life, and were more likely to have mental disorders. Cognitive function, in particular, is strongly associated with OD in PD patients.

20669268|t|Olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease and white matter abnormalities in central olfactory areas: A voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging study.
20669268|a|Olfactory dysfunction is known to occur before the appearance of the classical motor signs in Parkinson's disease (PD) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in PD have reported fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions in the early disease stages. We aimed to investigate the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and white matter (WM) FA of central olfactory areas in early PD. Twenty-four patients at Hoehn and Yahr stages I and II and 24 healthy controls matched by age, gender and years of education participated in this study. DTI was acquired at a 3 Tesla scanner and odor identification was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We performed FA voxelwise group comparisons in the central olfactory structures using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and correlation analyses between FA values in these central olfactory areas and UPSIT scores. Patients with severe microsmia (UPSIT between 19 and 25) and anosmia (UPSIT lower or equal to 18) had lower FA values than PD patients with mild/moderate or no olfactory dysfunction (UPSIT between 26 and 40) and healthy controls in the WM adjacent to gyrus rectus. In addition, patients with anosmia had reduced FA in the WM surrounding primary olfactory areas in comparison with healthy controls. FA values in the WM adjacent to primary olfactory cortex and right gyrus rectus correlated with UPSIT scores in the PD group. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that microstructural WM reductions are present in the central olfactory system of early stage PD patients and that these reductions are associated with reduced ability to smell.

23939345|t|Colonic neuropathology is independent of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
23939345|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) and constipation are two frequent and early non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Colonic PD neuropathology, the putative cause of constipation, can be analyzed and quantified using routine colonic biopsies and parallels disease severity. The present study was aimed at investigating whether the severity of neuropathology in the colon in PD is related to OD. Twenty-six PD patients were included. Colonic neuropathology, i.e., the density of Lewy pathology and the number of submucosal neurons, was unrelated to OD as assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification. This suggests that unlike colonic Lewy pathology, OD is unrelated to disease severity.

31531013|t|Sudden Intrabulbar Amyloid Increase Simultaneously Disrupts Olfactory Bulb Oscillations and Odor Detection.
31531013|a|There seems to be a correlation between soluble amyloid beta protein (Abeta) accumulation in the main olfactory bulb (OB) and smell deterioration in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and animal models. Moreover, this loss of smell appears to be related to alterations in neural network activity in several olfactory-related circuits, including the OB, as has been observed in anesthetized animals and brain slices. It is possible that there is a correlation between these two pathological phenomena, but a direct and simultaneous evaluation of the acute and direct effect of Abeta on OB activity while animals are actually smelling has not been performed. Thus, here, we tested the effects of acute intrabulbar injection of Abeta at a low dose (200 pmol) on the OB local field potential before and during the presence of a hidden piece of smelly food. Our results show that Abeta decreases the power of OB network activity while impairing the animal's ability to reach the hidden food. We found a strong relationship between the power of the OB oscillations and the correlation between OBs and the olfactory detection test scores. These findings provide a direct link between Abeta-induced OB network dysfunction and smell loss in rodents, which could be extrapolated to AD patients.

38527709|t|Impaired olfactory identification in dementia-free individuals is associated with the functional abnormality of the precuneus.
38527709|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory dysfunction indicates a higher risk of developing dementia. However, the potential structural and functional changes are still largely unknown. METHODS: A total of 236 participants were enrolled, including 45 Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals and 191dementia-free individuals. Detailed study methods, comprising neuropsychological assessment and olfactory identification test (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test, UPSIT), as well as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were applied in this research. The dementia-free individuals were divided into two sub-groups based on olfactory score: dementia-free with olfactory dysfunction (DF-OD) sub-group and dementia-free without olfactory dysfunction (DF-NOD) sub-group. The results were analyzed for subsequent intergroup comparisons and correlations. The cognitive assessment was conducted again three years later. RESULTS: (i) At dementia-free stage, there was a positive correlation between olfactory score and cognitive function. (ii) In dementia-free group, the volume of crucial brain structures involved in olfactory recognition and processing (such as amygdala, entorhinal cortex and basal forebrain volumes) are positively associated with olfactory score. (iii) Compared to the DF-NOD group, the DF-OD group showed a significant reduction in olfactory network (ON) function. (iv) Compared to DF-NOD group, there were significant functional connectivity (FC) decline between PCun_L(R)_4_1 in the precuneus of posterior default mode network (pDMN) and the salience network (SN) in DF-OD group, and the FC values decreased with falling olfactory scores. Moreover, in DF-OD group, the noteworthy reduction in FC were observed between PCun_L(R)_4_1 and amygdala, which was a crucial component of ON. (v) The AD conversion rate of DF-OD was 29.41%, while the DF-NOD group was 12.50%. The structural and functional changes in the precuneus were also observed in AD and were more severe. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the olfactory circuit, the precuneus is a critical structure in the odor identification process, whose abnormal function underlies the olfactory identification impairment of dementia-free individuals.

17553102|t|Alpha-synuclein pathology in the olfactory pathways of dementia patients.
17553102|a|Lewy-type pathology is a characteristic of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Thus far, the definitive diagnosis of these dementias can only be confirmed at post-mortem. However, it is known that the loss of smell (anosmia) is an early symptom in patients who develop dementia, and the use of the smell test has been proposed as an early diagnostic procedure. The aim of this study was to understand further the extent of Lewy pathology in the olfactory system of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Post-mortem tissue from 250 subjects was obtained from the OPTIMA brain bank. Five areas of the olfactory pathway were examined by immunolabelling for alpha-synuclein - a major component of Lewy pathology: the olfactory tract/bulb (n = 79), the anterior olfactory nucleus in the lateral olfactory gyrus (n = 193), the region of olfactory projection to the orbito-frontal cortex (n = 225), the hippocampus (n = 236) and the amygdala (n = 201). Results show that Lewy pathology affects different parts of the olfactory pathways differentially, suggesting a specific pattern of development of pathology. Clinical Parkinson's disease is most likely to be identified if the orbito-frontal cortex is affected, while the diagnosis is less likely if the pathology is restricted to the olfactory bulb or tract. These results suggest that pathology in the olfactory bulb and tract occurs prior to clinical signs of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the results presented here provide further evidence supporting the possible value of a smell test to aid the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

19448090|t|Olfactory impairment is more marked in patients with mild dementia with Lewy bodies than those with mild Alzheimer disease.
19448090|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia patients with anosmia are more likely to have Lewy body pathology at postmortem, but clinicopathological studies have only assessed olfaction in moderate dementia or an average of 5 years before death. It is not known whether, in patients with mild dementia (MMSE score over 20), olfactory function is more impaired in Alzheimer disease (AD) than dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: Patients with mild DLB (n = 21), mild AD (n = 27), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 21) and controls (n = 47) were assessed using a 16-item olfactory identification test and an olfactory threshold test which used sticks impregnated with differing concentrations of butanol. RESULTS: Patients with mild DLB had impaired olfactory identification ability compared with those with mild AD or MCI, independent of age, cognitive function and sex. The sensitivity of a cutoff score of seven correct responses out of 16 was 0.81 for distinguishing mild DLB from mild AD (AUC 0.682). The specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the same cut-off score were 0.41, 0.48 and 0.73, respectively. The olfactory threshold was not different in the AD and DLB groups. CONCLUSIONS: Simple bedside tests of olfactory identification merit further examination for their potential to improve the identification of patients with DLB when used alongside existing criteria. They are insufficiently specific for use in screening.

19526836|t|[Relationship between the regional cerebral blood flow and the cognitive function and anosmia in patients with Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease].
19526836|a|We compared the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the olfactory area and the cognitive function and anosmia in patient with Parkinson disease (PD) and in those with Alzheimer disease (AD). UPDRS III, MMSE, HDS-R, CDR, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were employed in this study. The subjects included 56 PD patients (average age 71.4+/-9.69 years), 23 AD patients (average age 73.3+/-7.12 years), 12 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (average age 72.5+/-6.89 years), and 9 age-matched controls (NC) (average age 73.8+/-6.61 years). Next we intravenously injected 1 ampule of thiamine propyldisulphide (Alinamin) and confirmed anosmia. In addition, we performed 123I-IMP SPECT (SEE methods) and satistically determined rCBF of the olfactory area based on the basis of the Z scores of the interest area. Anosima was detected in approximately 40% of the PD and AD patients. The HDS-R and MMSE scores were significantly higher in patients with anosima than in those without anosima; the CDR scores were significantly higher in the former than in the latter. Further, the incidence of anosima in PD patients and AD patients with MCI increased with an increase in the CDR scores. In order to determine the rCBF of the olfactory area of the PD and AD patients. As to rCBF of the olfactory area, we examined left and right Z scores of hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala, and uncus at Talairach level 3 and the scores of the Brodmann area 28, 34, 35, and 36 at Talairach level 5. In patients with anosmia, the Z scores were significantly high in cases with anosmia in all areas except the right Brodmann area 34 in PD patients and the right Brodmann area 28 and bilateral the Brodmann area 34 of both sides in AD patients. Some parts of the olfactory area are closely related to cognitive function, and it appeares that a reduced rCBF in the olfactory areas may lead to a functional decline in these regions which may cause anosmia and cognitive decline in PD and AD patients.

7324865|t|[Olfaction and dementia. Preliminary results of a clinical and experimental study with N-propanol].
7324865|a|Various reports concerning the oro-alimentary ducts of dements and increasing arguments in favour of a new etiopathogenic hypothesis for Pick's disease, involving impaired zinc metabolism and histological lesions partly linked with the hodology of the olfactory system, lie at the origin of our present clinical interest in olfaction. In a first stage, using a technique based on dilution with N-propanol, we observed certain conditions permitting an evaluation of the olfactory capacities of patients with Pick's disease, senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescense. There does not seem to be a decline in olfaction with age. Olfactory capacities in the two forms of dementia studied were distinctly inferior to those of non-dements. Olfactory habituation was more marked, especially in Pick's disease where there were also paradoxical responses which seemed to form part of a more general change in reaction to stimulus. In senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescence the response to olfactory stimulus declines with dilution of N-propanol and lesional extension. Observation of recorded parameters (EEG, psycho-galvanic reflex, ocular movement, breathing) is useful in Pick's disease and may be difficult in senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescence. Olfactory capacities appear to constitute an additional criterion on which to base a diagnosis of dementia. They could be used to help establish the neuro-biological bases of certain types of demential behaviour and to observe the progress of tentative therapies.

11385006|t|Anosmia in dementia is associated with Lewy bodies rather than Alzheimer's pathology.
11385006|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess olfactory function of patients with dementia. Odour detection ability is impaired in clinical Parkinson's disease. Evidence of impaired detection in patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease is inconsistent. No studies of olfaction have been neuropathologically validated. METHODS: The olfactory function of 92 patients with dementia and 94 controls was assessed using a simple bedside test as part of the Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA). Neuropathological assessment was made of cortical Lewy bodies and substantia nigra (SN) cell counts and of Alzheimer's disease in all 92 patients, 22 of whom had SN Lewy bodies and 43 of whom had only Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Patients with Lewy bodies were more likely to be anosmic than those with Alzheimer's disease or controls. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were not more likely to be anosmic than controls. Nor was anosmia associated with degree of neurofibrillary tangles, as assessed by Braak stage. Among subjects with Lewy bodies, overall cortical Lewy body scores and Lewy body density in the cingulate were higher in those who were anosmic. Consensus clinical criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies had a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 89%. In the absence of definite Alzheimer's disease, the criteria had sensitivity of 100%. In patients with definite Alzheimer's disease, anosmia was slightly more sensitive (55%) than the consensus criteria (33%). However, the addition of anosmia to the consensus criteria did not improve their overall performance. CONCLUSION: Dementia with Lewy bodies is associated with impaired odour detection. Misdiagnosis may have accounted for some previous reports of impaired odour detection in Alzheimer's disease. Simple but more sensitive tests of anosmia are required if they are to be clinically useful in identifying patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.

11901275|t|Severe dysosmia is specifically associated with Alzheimer-like memory deficits in nondemented elderly retirees.
11901275|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not (1) impaired olfactory function is associated with impaired memory on neuropsychological testing in healthy retirees, and if so then (2) whether memory impairment is most consistent with a mesiotemporal rather than frontal system disorder. METHODS: 173 independent residents of a continuing care retirement community were studied. Subjects completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and a battery of both general and specific cognitive measures that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Executive Interview (EXIT25). Subjects were examined twice over 3 years. RESULTS: UPSIT performance was normal in 21% and in the 'anosmic' range in 25% of subjects. Anosmic UPSIT performance was associated with significantly worse performance on all cognitive tests. However, only short-term verbal memory was independently associated with UPSIT-defined anosmia. This association remained significant after adjusting for the other cognitive and sociodemographic variables. The memory deficits of anosmic subjects were qualitatively consistent with a cortical type (type 1) dementing illness such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Over time, UPSIT-defined 'anosmic' cases suffered significantly greater declines on both the MMSE and the EXIT25, independently of baseline age, gender and MMSE score. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired odor identification in individuals without overt dementia is associated with an AD-like memory impairment and an increased rate of cognitive decline. The comorbid association of these deficits is consistent with the known hierarchical spread of preclinical AD pathology and may be a specific indicator of future clinical AD dementia.

20083801|t|Association of anosmia with autonomic failure in Parkinson disease.
20083801|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction and autonomic failure are gaining recognition as nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson disease (PD). This observational study assessed whether in PD anosmia and autonomic failure are related to each other or to neuroimaging evidence of striatal dopamine deficiency. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 23 patients with sporadic PD. Baroreflex-cardiovagal gain was quantified from the relationship between cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and baroreflex-sympathoneural function by responses of systolic pressure to the Valsalva maneuver and of hemodynamics and plasma norepinephrine (NE) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) levels to orthostasis. 6-[(18)F]Fluorodopamine PET and plasma and skeletal muscle microdialysate NE and DHPG were used to indicate cardiac and extracardiac noradrenergic innervation and brain 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa PET to indicate striatal dopaminergic innervation. Parkinsonism was assessed by UPDRS scores. RESULTS: Compared to patients with PD and normal to moderately decreased sense of smell, patients with anosmic PD had lower mean baroreflex-cardiovagal gain (p = 0.04), larger falls in systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and orthostasis (p = 0.04, p = 0.02), smaller orthostatic increments in plasma NE and DHPG (p = 0.003, p = 0.03), lower cardiac septal:hepatic and renal cortical:hepatic ratios of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity (p = 0.01, p = 0.06), and lower microdialysate NE and DHPG (p = 0.01; p = 0.006). Neither clinical severity of parkinsonism nor the putamen:occipital cortex ratio of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa-derived radioactivity was related to the UPSIT category. CONCLUSIONS: In Parkinson disease, anosmia is associated with baroreflex failure and cardiac and organ-selective extracardiac noradrenergic denervation, independently of parkinsonism or striatal dopaminergic denervation.

22305338|t|Olfactory ERPs in an odor/visual congruency task differentiate ApoE epsilon4 carriers from non-carriers.
22305338|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory and semantic processing. AD patients and MCI patients at risk for AD show altered N400 ERP responses to incongruent visual and verbal stimuli. AD patients exhibit neuropathology in olfactory brain areas before cognitive symptoms, suggesting the potential for olfactory processing to reflect early pathology. Despite this, odor congruency has not been examined. We investigated odor-image congruency in older adults at genetic risk for AD. ApoE epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers were screened for anosmia, severe hyposmia, and dementia. Olfactory ERPs were measured 600-1300 ms following odor-image pairs. Odors were each presented once congruently and once incongruently via an olfactometer. Pz amplitude significantly decreased on incongruent trials in e4 carriers. Pz amplitude differences on congruous and incongruous trials were larger in non carriers. Regression indicated that congruency showed very high sensitivity and specificity for correctly classifying epsilon4 carriers from non-carriers.

23871228|a|Drosophila melanogaster is an attractive model of familial Parkinson's disease, as flies with loss-of-function mutations of the parkin gene exhibit many pathologies observed in PD patients. Progressive motor deficits found in homozygous parkin mutants seem to result from mitochondrial pathology that causes indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration [1,2]. We have found that heterozygous parkin mutants have decreased lifespan, generally progressive motor dysfunction and olfactory deficits compared to control flies, suggesting that mutation of this gene produces a dominant phenotype. Tobacco smokers are dose-dependently less likely to develop PD [3,4]; subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies show that nicotine is protective in models of sporadic PD [6]. Literature addressing the potential protection by nicotine in Parkin loss-of-function models spans limited concentrations and selected time points in the organism's lifespan. We have found that parkin heterozygotes have late-onset climbing and flying deficits as well as decreased viability and olfactory deficits that precede motor defects. While chronic nicotine exposure decreases lifespan and climbing and flying abilities in control flies, it can improve viability and flying capability as well as rescue climbing and olfactory deficits in parkin heterozygotes. Dopaminergic neurons are spared in the parkin heterozygote, perhaps because this phenotype is less severe than in the homozygous parkin mutants. Nicotine pretreatment may be protective in sporadic PD patients and models; however, timely diagnosis remains to be an obstacle. Our results suggest that nicotine also may be protective in familial PD patients, who can be easily identified before motor symptoms occur.

28543731|t|Neuroimaging biomarkers and impaired olfaction in cognitively normal individuals.
28543731|a|OBJECTIVE: There is a need for inexpensive noninvasive tests to identify older healthy persons at risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) for enrollment in AD prevention trials. Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. METHODS: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (n = 829) to assess a composite AD signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and underwent 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (n = 306) and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (n = 305) positron emission tomography scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 829 CN participants (mean age = 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score < 6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope = -0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.76 to -0.09, p = 0.01 and slope = -0.72, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.28, p < 0.01, respectively). Reduced HVa, decreased AD signature cortical thickness, and increased amyloid accumulation were significantly associated with increased odds of anosmia. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that OI may be a noninvasive, inexpensive marker for risk stratification, for identifying participants at the preclinical stage of AD who may be at risk for cognitive impairment and eligible for inclusion in AD prevention clinical trials. These cross-sectional findings remain to be validated prospectively. Ann Neurol 2017;81:871-882.

38016198|t|Multimodal spatiotemporal monitoring of basal stem cell-derived organoids reveals progression of olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
38016198|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a highly prevalent symptom and an early sign of neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, the roles of peripheral olfactory system in disease progression and the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration remain to be studied. Olfactory epithelium (OE) organoid is an ideal model to study pathophysiology in vitro, yet the reliance on 3D culture condition limits continual in situ monitoring of organoid development. Here, we combined impedance biosensors and live imaging for real-time spatiotemporal analysis of OE organoids morphological and physiological features during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The impedance measurements showed that organoids generated from basal stem cells of APP/PS1 transgenic mice had lower proliferation rate than that from wild-type mice. In concert with the biosensor measurements, live imaging enabled to visualize the spatial and temporal dynamics of organoid morphology. Abnormal protein aggregation and accumulation, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, was found in AD organoids and increased as disease progressed. This multimodal in situ bioelectrical measurement and imaging provide a new platform for investigating onset mechanisms of OD, which would shed new light on early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

38151574|t|Clinical features and neurobiochemical mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson disease.
38151574|a|This study aimed to investigate clinical features, influencing factors and neurobiochemical mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction (OD) in Parkinson disease (PD). Total 39 patients were divided into the PD with OD (PD-OD) and PD with no OD (PD-nOD) groups according to overall olfactory function, including threshold, discrimination and identification, assessed by Sniffin' Sticks test. Motor function and non-motor symptoms were rated by multiple scales. Dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured. We found that the PD-OD group showed significantly lower score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, higher scores of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) Screening Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale than the PD-nOD group (p < 0.05). RBD Screening Questionnaire score was independently associated with the scores of overall olfactory function and discrimination (p < 0.05). Dopamine and acetylcholine levels in CSF from the PD-OD group was significantly lower than that from the PD-nOD group (p < 0.05). Dopamine and acetylcholine levels in CSF were significantly and positively correlated with the scores of overall olfactory function, threshold, discrimination and identification in PD patients (p < 0.05). RBD Screening Questionnaire score was significantly and negatively correlated with acetylcholine level in CSF in PD patients with poor olfactory detection (p < 0.05). This investigation reveals that PD-OD is associated with cognitive impairment, probable RBD and excessive daytime sleepiness. PD-OD is correlated with the decreased levels of dopamine and acetylcholine in CSF. RBD is an independent influencing factor of overall olfactory function and discrimination, and the decreased acetylcholine level in CSF may be the common neurobiochemical basis of RBD and OD in PD patients.

38517805|t|Opportunities and Pitfalls of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and Olfactory Dysfunction as Early Markers in Parkinson's Disease.
38517805|a|During its pre-motor stage, Parkinson's disease (PD) presents itself with a multitude of non-motor symptoms with different degrees of specificity and sensitivity. The most important among them are REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and olfactory dysfunction. RBD is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of REM sleep muscle atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. Olfactory dysfunction in individuals with prodromal PD is usually described as hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) or anosmia (complete loss of olfactory function). These symptoms can precede the full expression of motor symptoms by decades. A close comprehension of these symptoms and the underlying mechanisms may enable early screening as well as interventions to improve patients' quality of life. Therefore, these symptoms have unmatched potential for identifying PD patients in prodromal stages, not only allowing early diagnosis but potentially opening a window for early, possibly disease-modifying intervention. However, they come with certain challenges. This review addresses some of the key opportunities and pitfalls of both RBD and olfactory dysfunction as early markers of PD.

18779429|t|Phantosmias and Parkinson disease.
18779429|a|BACKGROUND: Impaired olfaction is a common, nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, qualitative olfactory disturbances, such as odor distortions, have not been extensively reported in this condition. OBJECTIVE: To describe 2 patients who reported positive olfactory symptoms preceding typical PD, which were consistent with olfactory hallucinations (phantosmias) in the absence of major smell deficit. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University hospital. Patients We describe 2 patients, both seen in 2007, who reported pleasant olfactory hallucinations for several years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Iodine I 123-labeled ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography and olfactometric testing results. RESULTS: The (123)I-labeled ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography showed reduced radiotracer uptake in both striatum more marked in the putamen and on the left side in patient 1 and reduced radiotracer uptake in both putamen more marked on the right side in patient 2. Olfactometric testing showed mild hyposmia in patient 1 and normal function in patient 2. The disappearance of the phantosmias in both patients coincided with the development of typical PD. CONCLUSION: We propose phantosmia as a new premotor manifestation of PD and suggest that qualitative abnormalities of olfaction, rather than the typical smell loss demonstrated in this condition, should be more carefully examined in the prodromal phase of PD.

20211105|t|Smell and preclinical Alzheimer disease: study of 29 patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment.
20211105|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the olfactory function in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and the relationship to the progression from aMCI to Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Cohort prospective study on aMCI patients at the first evaluation (T0) and at the 18-month follow-up (T1). SETTING: Alzheimer Unit of the University of L'Aquila, Italy. METHODS: Twenty-nine aMCI patients were enrolled in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Olfactory function was studied with the Sniffin' Sticks Screening Test (SSST) and the Sniffin' Sticks Extended Test (SSET). Olfactory functions were related to neurocognitive functions assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mental Deterioration Battery (MDB). RESULTS: At T0, aMCI patients showed an olfactory impairment and all of the aMCI patients had lower olfaction scores at T1. At T1, 9 of the 29 aMCI patients (31%) developed AD and had lower mean SSST and SSET scores than 20 aMCI patients who did not develop AD. The most significant relationship was found between olfactory discrimination and visuospatial ability, language skill, and the Rey Immediate test of the MDB and between olfactory identification and the Rey Delayed test. CONCLUSION: Odour discrimination and identification performance correlated more prominently than detection thresholds with performance on neuropsychological tests. We concluded that the olfactory deficit occurs early in aMCI, so we suggest introducing the clinical routine use of the olfactory test for early identification of the progression of the decline from aMCI to AD.

25633674|t|Olfactory cortex degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
25633674|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits are prevalent in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These symptoms precede clinical onset of cognitive and memory deficits and coincide with AD pathology preferentially in the central olfactory structures, suggesting a potential biomarker for AD early detection and progression. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that structural degeneration of the primary olfactory cortex (POC) could be detected in AD as well as in MCI patients and would be correlated with olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) alterations, reflecting loss of olfactory cortex activity. METHODS: Total structural volumes and fMRI activation volumes of the POC and hippocampus were measured along with olfactory and cognitive behavioral tests in 27 cognitively normal (CN), 21 MCI, and 15 AD subjects. RESULTS: Prominent atrophy in the POC and hippocampus was found in both AD and MCI subjects and correlated with behavioral measurements. While behavioral and volumetric measurements showed a gradual decline from CN to MCI to AD, olfactory activation volume in the POC and hippocampus showed a steeper decline in the MCI group compared to corresponding tissue volume, resembling the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Decline in olfactory activity was correlated with the AD structural degeneration in the POC. A more prominent olfactory activity deficit than that of behavioral and tissue volume measurements was shown in the MCI stage. Olfactory fMRI may thus provide an earlier and more sensitive measure of functional neurodegeneration in AD and MCI patients.

29134611|t|Exploring white matter microstructure and olfaction dysfunction in early parkinson disease: diffusion MRI reveals new insight.
29134611|a|Olfaction dysfunction is considered as a robust marker of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD). Measurement of olfaction function as a screening test is unsatisfactory due to long lead time interval and low specificity for detection of PD. Use of imaging markers might yield more accurate predictive values and provide bases for combined use of imaging and clinical markers for early PD. Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted on 85 de novo PD patients in and 36 healthy controls to find: first, white matter tracts with significant difference in quantitative anisotropy between PD groups with various degrees of olfaction dysfunction and second, second fibers with correlation with University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score in each group using a multiple regression analysis considering age, sex, GDS and MoCA score. Local connectomes were determined in seven of all the possible comparisons, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). PD patients with anosmia and normal olfaction had the highest number of fibers with decreased connectivity in left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral fornix, bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), bilateral cingulum, bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) and body, genu and splenium of corpus callosum (CC) (FDR = 0.0013). In multiple regression analysis, connectivity in the body, genu and splenium of CC and bilateral fornix had significant negative correlation (FDR between 0.019 and 0.083), and bilateral cingulum and MCP had significant positive correlation (FDR between 0.022 and 0.092) with UPSIT score. White matter connectivity in healthy controls could not be predicted by UPSIT score using the same model. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that microstructural degenerative changes in these areas underlie the clinical phenotype of prodromal olfaction dysfunction in PD and that diffusion parameters of these areas might be able to serve as signature markers for early detection of PD. This is the first report that confirms a discriminative role for UPSIT score in identifying PD specific changes in white matter microstructure. Our results open a window to identify microstructural signatures of prodromal PD in white matter.

30007334|t|Diagnostic Accuracy, Item Analysis and Age Effects of the UPSIT Spanish Version in Parkinson's Disease.
30007334|a|OBJECTIVE: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is the most commonly used test to detect olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the cut-off score for clinical purposes is often difficult to establish because of age and sex effects. The current work aims to study the sensitivity and specificity of the UPSIT Spanish version and its accuracy in discriminating PD patients at different age groups from healthy controls (HC), and to perform an item analysis. METHOD: Ninety-seven non-demented PD patients and 65 HC were assessed with the UPSIT Spanish version. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for PD were calculated. Multiple regression analysis was used to define predictors of UPSIT scores. RESULTS: Using the normative cut-off score for anosmia (<=18), the UPSIT showed a sensitivity of 54.6% with a specificity of 100.0% for PD. We found that, using the UPSIT cut-off score of <=25, sensitivity was 81.4% and specificity 84.6% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.908). Diagnosis and age were good predictors of UPSIT scores (B = -10.948; p < .001; B = -0.203; p < .001). When optimal cut-off scores were considered according to age ranges (<=60, 61-70, and >=71), sensitivity and specificity values were >80.0% for all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the Spanish UPSIT version, sensitivity and specificity are improved when specific cut-off scores for different age groups are computed.

31383472|t|The therapeutic effect of deep brain stimulation on olfactory functions and clinical scores in Parkinson's disease.
31383472|a|Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is still a highly effective treatment option that significantly improves motor function in advanced PD. Moreover, previous findings have shown that Olfactory dysfunction (OD) has been found in a majority of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Despite this, the effect of DBS on the olfactory function is not fully understood. Here we aimed to determine the effect of STN DBS on OD by evaluating the olfactory functions in the preoperative and postoperative early stages (1st and 3rd months) in forty-five PD patients and 40 healthy controls. The therapeutic effect of DBS on the improvement of motor functions was parallelly investigated. We have observed that there was a significant improvement in OI in the 1st month and in all olfactory parameters (OT, ODI, OI, and TDI) in the 3rd month. In evaluating the motor functional scores, we have revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) difference between preoperative UPDRS-motor score (23 +- 7.3) and the postoperative 3rd month score (11.1 +- 5.1). Although Beck Depression and Anxiety scores were improved to a certain level in the 3rd month, this improvement was not at a statistically significant level (p > 0.05). As a conclusion, we have shown that STN-DBS improves the smell functions in PD within three months suggesting that the therapeutic effects of DBS might have a wide range of therapeutic spectrum. Despite some limitations (i.e., short follow-up period) our study gives a critical message that future studies are needed to evaluate the functional correlates of STN-DBS treatment in PD patients.

32597818|t|Parkinson's Disease Affects Functional Connectivity within the Olfactory-Trigeminal Network.
32597818|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a frequent symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that appears years prior to diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that PD-related OD is different from non-parkinsonian forms of olfactory dysfunction (NPOD) as PD patients maintain trigeminal sensitivity as opposed to patients with NPOD who typically exhibit reduced trigeminal sensitivity. We hypothesize the presence of a specific alteration of functional connectivity between trigeminal and olfactory processing areas in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess potential differences in functional connectivity within the chemosensory network in 15 PD patients and compared them to 15 NPOD patients, and to 15 controls. METHODS: Functional MRI scanning session included resting-state and task-related scans where participants carried out an olfactory and a trigeminal task. We compared functional connectivity, using a seed-based correlation approach, and brain network modularity of the chemosensory network. RESULTS: PD patients had impaired functional connectivity within the chemosensory network while no such changes were observed for NPOD patients. No group differences we found in modularity of the identified networks. Both patient groups exhibited impaired connectivity when executing an olfactory task, while network modularity was significantly weaker for PD patients than both other groups. When performing a trigeminal task, no changes were found for PD patients, but NPOD patients exhibited impaired connectivity. Conversely, PD patients exhibited a significantly higher network modularity than both other groups. CONCLUSION: In summary, the specific pattern of functional connectivity and chemosensory network recruitment in PD-related OD may explain distinct behavioral chemosensory features in PD when compared to NPOD patients and healthy controls.

33627500|t|Olfactory Testing in Parkinson Disease and REM Behavior Disorder: A Machine Learning Approach.
33627500|a|OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify an abbreviated test of impaired olfaction amenable for use in busy clinical environments in prodromal (isolated REM sleep behavior disorder [iRBD]) and manifest Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: Eight hundred ninety individuals with PD and 313 controls in the Discovery cohort study underwent Sniffin' Stick odor identification assessment. Random forests were initially trained to distinguish individuals with poor (functional anosmia/hyposmia) and good (normosmia/super-smeller) smell ability using all 16 Sniffin' Sticks. Models were retrained using the top 3 sticks ranked by order of predictor importance. One randomly selected 3-stick model was tested in a second independent PD dataset (n = 452) and in 2 iRBD datasets (Discovery n = 241, Marburg n = 37) before being compared to previously described abbreviated Sniffin' Stick combinations. RESULTS: In differentiating poor from good smell ability, the overall area under the curve (AUC) value associated with the top 3 sticks (anise/licorice/banana) was 0.95 in the Development dataset (sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%, positive predictive value 92%, negative predictive value 90%). Internal and external validation confirmed AUCs >=0.90. The combination of the 3-stick model determined poor smell, and an RBD screening questionnaire score of >=5 separated those with iRBD from controls with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 65%, 100%, 100%, and 30%. CONCLUSIONS: Our 3-Sniffin'-Stick model holds potential utility as a brief screening test in the stratification of individuals with PD and iRBD according to olfactory dysfunction. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that a 3-Sniffin'-Stick model distinguishes individuals with poor and good smell ability and can be used to screen for individuals with iRBD.

33835144|t|Olfactory-Trigeminal Interactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
33835144|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a highly frequent early non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). An important step to potentially use OD for the development of early diagnostic tools of PD is to differentiate PD-related OD from other forms of non-parkinsonian OD (NPOD: postviral, sinunasal, post-traumatic, and idiopathic OD). Measuring non-olfactory chemosensory modalities, especially the trigeminal system, may allow to characterize a PD-specific olfactory profile. We here review the literature on PD-specific chemosensory alteration patterns compared with NPOD. Specifically, we focused on the impact of PD on the trigeminal system and particularly on the interaction between olfactory and trigeminal systems. As this interaction is seemingly affected in a disease-specific manner, we propose a model of interaction between both chemosensory systems that is distinct for PD-related OD and NPOD. These patterns of chemosensory impairment still need to be confirmed in prodromal PD; nevertheless, appropriate chemosensory tests may eventually help to develop diagnostic tools to identify individuals at risks for PD.

32583050|t|Olfactory testing does not predict beta-amyloid, MRI measures of neurodegeneration or vascular pathology in the British 1946 birth cohort.
32583050|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of olfactory identification deficits as a predictor of cerebral beta-amyloid status and other markers of brain health in cognitively normal adults aged ~ 70 years. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational cohort study. 389 largely healthy and cognitively normal older adults were recruited from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (1946 British Birth cohort) and investigated for olfactory identification deficits, as measured by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Outcome measures were imaging markers of brain health derived from 3 T MRI scanning (cortical thickness, entorhinal cortex thickness, white matter hyperintensity volumes); 18F florbetapir amyloid-PET scanning; and cognitive testing results. Participants were assessed at a single centre between March 2015 and January 2018. RESULTS: Mean (+- SD) age was 70.6 (+- 0.7) years, 50.8% were female. 64.5% had hyposmia and 2.6% anosmia. Olfaction showed no association with beta-amyloid status, hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, AD signature cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity volume, or cognition. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In the early 70s, olfactory function is not a reliable predictor of a range of imaging and cognitive measures of preclinical AD. Olfactory identification deficits are not likely to be a useful means of identifying asymptomatic amyloidosis. Further studies are required to assess if change in olfaction may be a proximity marker for the development of cognitive impairment.

32925101|t|Self-Reported Versus Objectively Assessed Olfaction and Parkinson's Disease Risk.
32925101|a|BACKGROUND: Poor olfaction is a prodromal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, self-reported sense of smell is often dismissed as unreliable. OBJECTIVE: To assess self-reported and objectively assessed sense of smell, independently and jointly, in relation to future risk for PD. METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis using data from 2,424 participants, ages 71-82 at baseline, from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. Exposures were self-reported poor sense of smell or taste and the objectively measured 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test score. The outcome was incident PD, analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, race, and cognitive function. RESULTS: After approximately 10 years of follow-up, both self-reported and objectively tested poor sense of smell were independently associated with a higher risk of developing PD: the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 2.8 (1.3, 5.9) and 4.0 (2.1, 7.5), respectively. When analyzed jointly, compared with participants who reported and tested normal, the hazard ratio was 2.2 (1.0, 4.6) for those reported poor sense of smell but tested normal, 3.6 (1.9, 6.9) for reported normal but tested poor, and 7.8 (3.2, 19.4) for both reported and tested poor. We did not find significant interactions between self-reported and objectively tested sense of smell in predicting PD risk. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that self-reported poor sense of smell or taste should not be simply dismissed as useless in predicting risk of PD. Future studies should confirm our finding and evaluate whether structured questionnaires may further improve the predictability.

18477840|t|Effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on olfactory function in Parkinson's disease patients.
18477840|a|OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on olfaction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: 15 patients suffering from sporadic PD-related dysosmia were implanted with bilateral electrodes aimed at the STN. One week before the surgery, odor detection threshold (DT) and identification threshold (IT) were evaluated in all patients using the 'five odor olfactory detection arrays' in both medication-off and medication-on conditions. 15 healthy age-matched controls also received the same olfactory evaluation. Patient evaluations were repeated at 6 and 12 months postoperatively in a medication-off/stimulator-on or medication-off/stimulator-off condition. Odor DT and IT scores were compared pre- and postoperatively, as well as between the medication-off/stimulator-on or -off conditions. RESULTS: The motor symptoms of all 15 PD patients, including rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability, and gait were significantly improved after stimulator implantation. The UPDRS motor (UPDRS III) scores decreased significantly in the medication-off/stimulator-on condition (p < 0.01). The odor DT and IT scores of PD patients were higher than those of healthy controls (p < 0.01). In the medication-off/stimulator-off condition, there was no significant difference in the odor DT and IT scores in PD patients pre- vs. postoperatively (p > 0.05). Notably, there were no significant alterations to DT scores in the stimulator-on and -off conditions at the 6- and 12-month follow-up (p > 0.05), whereas IT scores were significantly improved in the stimulation-on relative to the stimulation-off condition at the 6- and 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: STN DBS can significantly improve olfactory cognitive function in PD patients. The possible mechanisms include an improvement in striatal metabolism and neuronal activity in the orbitofrontal cortex mediated by STN DBS, as well as increased glucose metabolism in the striatum, midbrain, cingulate gyrus, and motor and higher-order somatosensory association cortices.

20182024|t|Effects of caffeine in Parkinson's disease: from neuroprotection to the management of motor and non-motor symptoms.
20182024|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 60 years. Classically, PD is considered to be a motor system disease and its diagnosis is based on the presence of a set of cardinal motor signs (rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor) that are consequence of a pronounced death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Nowadays there is considerable evidence showing that non-dopaminergic degeneration also occurs in other brain areas which seems to be responsible for the deficits in olfactory, emotional and memory functions that precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. The present review attempts to examine results reported in epidemiological, clinical and animal studies to provide a comprehensive picture of the antiparkinsonian potential of caffeine. Convergent epidemiological and pre-clinical data suggest that caffeine may confer neuroprotection against the underlying dopaminergic neuron degeneration, and influence the onset and progression of PD. The available data also suggest that caffeine can improve the motor deficits of PD and that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists such as istradefylline reduces OFF time and dyskinesia associated with standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments. Finally, recent experimental findings have indicated the potential of caffeine in the management of non-motor symptoms of PD, which do not improve with the current dopaminergic drugs. Altogether, the studies reviewed provide strong evidence that caffeine may represent a promising therapeutic tool in PD, thus being the first compound to restore both motor and non-motor early symptoms of PD together with its neuroprotective potential.

28651678|t|Latent Cognitive Phenotypes in De Novo Parkinson's Disease: A Person-Centered Approach.
28651678|a|OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is an important aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is considerable heterogeneity in its presentation. This investigation aims to identify and characterize latent cognitive phenotypes in early PD. METHODS: Latent class analysis, a data-driven, person-centered, cluster analysis was performed on cognitive data from the Parkinson's Progressive Markers Initiative baseline visit. This analytic method facilitates identification of naturally occurring endophenotypes. Resulting classes were compared across biomarker, symptom, and demographic data. RESULTS: Six cognitive phenotypes were identified. Three demonstrated consistent performance across indicators, representing poor ("Weak-Overall"), average ("Typical-Overall"), and strong ("Strong-Overall") cognition. The remaining classes demonstrated unique patterns of cognition, characterized by "Strong-Memory," "Weak-Visuospatial," and "Amnestic" profiles. The Amnestic class evidenced greater tremor severity and anosmia, but was unassociated with biomarkers linked with Alzheimer's disease. The Weak-Overall class was older and reported more non-motor features associated with cognitive decline, including anxiety, depression, autonomic dysfunction, anosmia, and REM sleep behaviors. The Strong-Overall class was younger, more female, and reported less dysautonomia and anosmia. Classes were unrelated to disease duration, functional independence, or available biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Latent cognitive phenotypes with focal patterns of impairment were observed in recently diagnosed individuals with PD. Cognitive profiles were found to be independent of traditional biomarkers and motoric indices of disease progression. Only globally impaired class was associated with previously reported indicators of cognitive decline, suggesting this group may drive the effects reported in studies using variable-based analysis. Longitudinal and neuroanatomical characterization of classes will yield further insight into the evolution of cognitive change in the disease. (JINS, 2017, 23, 551-563).

39113792|t|Rbm24/Notch1 signaling regulates adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and mediates Parkinson-associated olfactory dysfunction.
39113792|a|Rationale: Adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) is essential for maintaining neural homeostasis, and its dysregulation contributes to anosmia and delayed tissue healing in neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite intricate regulatory networks identified in SVZ neurogenesis, the molecular mechanisms dynamically maintaining neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in response to physiological and pathological stimuli remain incompletely elucidated. Methods: We generated an RNA binding motif protein 24 (Rbm24) knockout model to investigate its impact on adult neurogenesis in the SVZ, employing immunofluorescence, immunoblot, electrophysiology, RNA-sequencing, and in vitro experiments. Further investigations utilized a PD mouse model, along with genetic and pharmacological manipulations, to elucidate Rbm24 involvement in PD pathology. Results: Rbm24, a multifaceted post-transcriptional regulator of cellular homeostasis, exhibited broad expression in the SVZ from development to aging. Deletion of Rbm24 significantly impaired NSPC proliferation in the adult SVZ, ultimately resulting in collapsed neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb. Notably, Rbm24 played a specific role in maintaining Notch1 mRNA stability in adult NSPCs. The Rbm24/Notch1 signaling axis was significantly downregulated in the SVZ of PD mice. Remarkably, overexpression of Rbm24 rescued disruption of adult neurogenesis and olfactory dysfunction in PD mice, and these effects were hindered by DAPT, a potent inhibitor of Notch1. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of the Rbm24/Notch1 signaling axis in regulating adult SVZ neurogenesis under physiological and pathological circumstances. This provides valuable insights into the dynamic regulation of NSPC homeostasis and offers a potential targeted intervention for PD and related neurological disorders.

19205070|t|Biopsies of olfactory epithelium in patients with Parkinson's disease.
19205070|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving several neuronal systems. Impaired olfactory function may constitute one of the earliest symptoms of PD. However, it is still unclear to what degree changes of the olfactory epithelium may contribute to dysosmia and if these changes are different from those of other hyposmic or anosmic patients. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that olfactory loss in PD is a consequence of specific PD-related damage of olfactory epithelium. Biopsies of 7 patients diagnosed with PD were taken. Six patients with PD were hyposmic, one anosmic. As non-PD controls served 9 patients with hyposmia, 9 with anosmia, and 7 normosmic individuals. Further, nasal mucosa of 4 postmortem individuals was investigated. Immunohistochemical examinations were performed with antibodies against olfactory marker protein (OMP), protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), beta-tubulin, (BT), proliferation-associated antigen (Ki 67), the stem cell marker nestin, cytokeratin, p75NGFr, and alpha-synuclein. Most of the biopsy specimens exhibited irregular areas of olfactory-like, dysplastic epithelium positive for either PGP 9.5 or BT, but negative for OMP. No major histochemical differences in either the expression or distribution of these proteins were observed in the olfactory epithelium of patients with PD compared with controls. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) data indicated mRNA for OMP in almost all subjects, independently of their olfactory performance. These data support the idea that olfactory loss in Parkinson's disease is not a consequence of damage to the olfactory epithelium but rather results from distinct central-nervous abnormalities.

20374072|t|Is rhinorrhea an under-recognized intrinsic symptom of Parkinson disease? A prospective pilot study.
20374072|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence of idiopathic rhinorrhea in PD patients versus controls, to determine the correlation between rhinorrhea and anosmia, and the factors associated with rhinorrhea. SCOPE: A cohort of 61 PD patients and 51 age-matched controls completed a survey about rhinorrhea and underwent the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We compared the prevalence of idiopathic rhinorrhea in the PD patients versus controls, the correlation between rhinorrhea and anosmia in PD patients, and the factors associated with rhinorrhea in the PD patients. The results of the study are that 6% of controls versus 24% of PD patients had rhinorrhea (p = .03); moreover, only 2% of controls versus 15% of PD patients had severe rhinorrhea. CONCLUSION: Rhinorrhea is more prevalent in PD patients compared to controls and it does not significantly impact performance on a smell test.

24482154|t|Olfactory-related cortical atrophy is associated with olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
24482154|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is often associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and can precede characteristic motor symptoms by several years. Olfactory-related cortical atrophy has been reported in PD, although the extent and association between cortical atrophy and olfactory dysfunction have been controversial. The present study examined whether olfactory dysfunction is associated with gray matter (GM) volume in brain regions subserving primary and secondary olfactory processing. METHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted brain MRIs were acquired from 40 PD without dementia and 40 matched controls along with smell identification scores. Brain volumes were compared using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Compared to controls, PD patients sustained greater GM loss localized to bilateral piriform cortex (PC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Reduced olfactory performance in PD was significantly associated with lower GM volumes in PC and OFC. CONCLUSIONS: Both primary and secondary olfactory cortical atrophy occurred in PD and were associated with olfactory dysfunction.

35166976|t|Olfactory dysfunction is associated with motor function only in tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease.
35166976|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of olfactory impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is 50-90%, and therefore, olfactory dysfunction is one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in patients with PD. Numerous studies have evaluated the association between motor and non-motor symptoms and olfactory dysfunction in PD. AIM: In this study, we investigated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction, which is measured using the UPSIT test, with other motor and non-motor symptoms separately in three motor subtypes of PD, including tremor dominant (TD), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), and indeterminate and healthy subjects. METHODS: We recruited 487 early-stage PD patients (43 PIGD, 406 TD, and 38 indeterminate) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 197) from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). All participants completed motor and non-motor tests at baseline visit and after 4 years of follow-up. Subjects underwent common PD scaling tests. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction was significantly correlated with declined motor functions only in the TD subtype. Also, significant correlations were noticed between olfactory dysfunction and speed-attention processing and executive function in the HCs as well. Finally, no significant or meaningful association was observed in the PIGD and indeterminate subtype. Anosmia and hyposmia subjects in the TD group had the worse motor and non-motor scores compared to normosmia subjects after 4 years. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction was significantly correlated with declined motor functions in the TD subtype. This is indicating that olfactory dysfunction may be an early motor and non-motor biomarker only in the TD subtype. However, it is possible that the involvement of olfactory function in other subtypes is not strong enough to make it a useful marker of diseases progression.

35869271|t|Seed-induced Abeta deposition alters neuronal function and impairs olfaction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
35869271|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) which ultimately forms plaques. These Abeta deposits can be induced in APP transgenic mouse models by prion-like seeding. It has been widely accepted that anosmia and hyposmia occur during the early stages of AD, even before cognitive deficits are present. In order to determine the impact of seed-induced Abeta deposits on olfaction, we performed intracerebral injections of seed-competent brain homogenate into the olfactory bulb of young pre-depositing APP transgenic mice. Remarkably, we observed a dramatic olfactory impairment in those mice. Furthermore, the number of newborn neurons as well as the activity of cells in the mitral cell layer was decreased. Notably, exposure to an enriched environment reduced Abeta seeding, vivified neurogenesis and most importantly reversed olfactory deficits. Based on our findings, we conclude that altered neuronal function as a result of induced Abeta pathology might contribute to olfactory dysfunction in AD.

37301657|t|Impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on olfaction in Parkinson's disease: Clinical features and functional hypotheses.
37301657|a|Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical therapy typically applied in Parkinson's disease (PD). The efficacity of DBS on the control of motor symptoms in PD is well grounded while the efficacity on non-motor symptoms is more controversial, especially on olfactory disorders (ODs). The present review shows that DBS does not improve hyposmia but can affect positively identification/discrimination scores in PD. The functional hypotheses suggest complex mechanisms in terms of cerebral connectivity and neurogenesis process which could act indirectly on the olfactory bulb and olfactory pathways related to specific cognitive olfactory tasks. The functional hypotheses also suggest complex mechanisms of cholinergic neurotransmitter interactions involved in these pathways. Finally, the impact of DBS on general cognitive functions in PD could also be beneficial to identification/discrimination tasks in PD.

38580172|t|Potential Convergence of Olfactory Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease and COVID-19: The Role of Neuroinflammation.
38580172|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that affects 7-10 million individuals worldwide. A common early symptom of PD is olfactory dysfunction (OD), and more than 90% of PD patients suffer from OD. Recent studies have highlighted a high incidence of OD in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review investigates the potential convergence of OD in PD and COVID-19, particularly focusing on the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation contributes to OD and neurological events. Starting from our fundamental understanding of the olfactory bulb, we summarize the clinical features of OD and pathological features of the olfactory bulb from clinical cases and autopsy reports in PD patients. We then examine SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory bulb neuropathology and OD and emphasize the SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammatory cascades potentially leading to PD manifestations. By activating microglia and astrocytes, as well as facilitating the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to the onset or exacerbation of PD. We also discuss the possible contributions of NF-kappaB, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the JAK/STAT, p38 MAPK, TLR4, IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 and cGAS-STING signaling pathways. Although olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 may be reversible, it is challenging to restore OD in patients with PD. With the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and the recurrence of infections, we call for continued attention to the intersection between PD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially from the perspective of OD.

19753620|t|Retronasal olfactory function in Parkinson's disease.
19753620|a|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Orthonasal olfaction is severely altered in PD patients. Retronasal olfactory function has been shown to be preserved under certain conditions even in the absence of orthonasal function. This study was undertaken to investigate retronasal versus orthonasal olfactory function in Parkinson's disease (PD). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: A total of 45 PD patients (mean age, 61 years; range 26-82 years) underwent orthonasal olfactory testing with a standardized olfactory test (Sniffin' Sticks) and retronasal olfactory testing with a 10-item identification kit based on aromatized powders. RESULTS: Regarding orthonasal tests, all PD patients scored within the range of hyposmia and functional anosmia. The mean correct orthonasal identification score for PD patients was 56% +/- 2.6%, and the mean retronasal identification rate was 60% +/- 3%. There was no significant difference between ortho- and retronasal odor identification (P = .15). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that retronasal and orthonasal olfactory function are severely impaired in PD patients, and this impairment is of similar magnitude for both functions. The contribution of this finding to the food-intake behavior of PD patients is discussed.

20128674|t|The relationship between anosmia, constipation, and orthostasis and Parkinson's disease duration: results of a pilot study.
20128674|a|Autonomic symptomatology is prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and impacts quality of life, yet little data exist on the presentation of autonomic dysregulation. This study measures orthostasis, constipation, and anosmia in 58 PD patients and 51 age-matched controls enrolled in the University of Florida's Movement Disorders Center. Patients had their blood pressure measured while seated and in standing position, performed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), and completed a constipation survey. Our PD patients had a significantly different average decrease in systolic BP from a seated to standing position compared with their age-matched controls (5.90 mmHg (SD 17.03) vs. 2.6 mmHg (SD 11.28); p = .05). The difference in heart rate from seated to standing positions was not significant. Reflexive tachycardia was inversely proportional to levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) score (p = .002). Anosmia occurred in 96.4% of the PD group and 49% of the controls (p < .001). Constipation was also more prevalent in the PD population than in the controls (67.3% vs. 21.6%; p < .001). Both anosmia and constipation were correlated with disease duration (p = .038 and .04 respectively). Our study suggests that increasing levels of dopaminergic therapy inhibits reflexive tachycardia. Furthermore, our study suggests that anosmia and constipation progress with the primary disease process.

31271464|t|Predictive value of olfactory impairment for cognitive decline among cognitively normal adults.
31271464|a|OBJECTIVE: Dementia affects over 47 million people worldwide. Olfactory impairment (OI) is a well-established predictive marker of conversion to dementia among those with mild cognitive impairment. This systematic review aims to describe the predictive value of OI for future cognitive decline among cognitively normal adults. METHODS: A literature search encompassing PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane for longitudinal cohort studies following cognitively normal adults with baseline OI in comparison to those without OI reporting incident cognitive impairment or dementia was included. Study design, participant demographics, olfactory testing method, and incidence of cognitive decline or dementia were abstracted. Two investigators independently reviewed all articles. RESULTS: The search yielded 964 nonduplicate abstracts and titles, from which 19 full-text articles were reviewed and 10 were included. Studies included were all good quality (mean score 8.7 of 9), and all studies (100%) found a statistically significant association between baseline OI and incident cognitive decline compared with normosmic controls. CONCLUSION: The existing literature suggests that OI predicts future cognitive decline among cognitively normal adults, supporting olfactory evaluation as a low-cost, minimally invasive, and widely available screening tool to be used in combination with other tests to identify adults at early risk of dementia.

36702960|t|Non-visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.
36702960|a|BACKGROUND: Non-visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be prevalent and distressing. Most existing research has however, focused on visual hallucinations as well as related risk factors. The current study thus conducted a systematic review to collate existing evidence on non-visual hallucinations in PD, focusing on their prevalence, phenomenology, and clinical-cognitive correlates. METHODS: Ninety-one relevant studies were included from a systematic search across PsycINFO APA, PubMed, and Web of Science, for peer-reviewed publications in the English language, from 1970 to the present. These comprised a mix of case (30 studies; n = 56) and group design (62 studies; n = 7346) studies, divided into three somewhat overlapping collections to address our three research foci. RESULTS: Prevalence estimates for hallucinations were: auditory 1.5-72.0%, olfactory 1.6-21.0%, somatic-tactile 0.4-22.5%, gustatory 1.0-15.0%, and sensed presence 0.9-73.3%. Phenomenological inquiries revealed descriptions of vivid, consuming events replete with elaborate detail, adversely affecting PD patients in different ways. Overt experiences of multisensory hallucinations were also highly variable (0.4-80%) but exceedingly common, reported by almost half of the 45 included prevalence studies. There was some evidence for modality-specific hallucination predictors, but this was largely tentative, pending robust replication. CONCLUSIONS: Marked prevalence figures coupled with phenomenological descriptions implicating distress denote that non-visual and multisensory hallucinations in PD are of clinical significance. More direct research and clinical attention need to be devoted to the study and management of such hallucinatory experiences.

38291474|t|Olfactory and cognitive decrements in 1991 Gulf War veterans with gulf war illness/chronic multisymptom illness.
38291474|a|BACKGROUND: Gulf War illness (GWI)/Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI) is a disorder related to military service in the 1991 Gulf War (GW). Prominent symptoms of GWI/CMI include fatigue, pain, and cognitive dysfunction. Although anosmia is not a typical GWI/CMI symptom, anecdotally some GW veterans have reported losing their sense smell shortly after the war. Because olfactory deficit is a prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and because we previously reported suggestive evidence that deployed GW veterans may be at increased risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia, the current study examined the relationship between olfactory and cognitive function in deployed GW veterans. METHODS: Eighty deployed GW veterans (mean age: 59.9  +-7.0; 4 female) were tested remotely with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Veterans also completed self-report questionnaires about their health and deployment-related exposures and experiences. UPSIT and MoCA data from healthy control (HC) participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study were downloaded for comparison. RESULTS: GW veterans had a mean UPSIT score of 27.8  +- 6.3 (range 9-37) and a mean MoCA score of 25.3  +- 2.8 (range 19-30). According to age- and sex-specific normative data, 31% of GW veterans (vs. 8% PPMI HCs) had UPSIT scores below the 10th percentile. Nearly half (45%) of GW veterans (vs. 8% PPMI HCs) had MoCA scores below the cut-off for identifying MCI. Among GW veterans, but not PPMI HCs, there was a positive correlation between UPSIT and MoCA scores (Spearman's rho = 0.39, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in UPSIT or MoCA scores between GW veterans with and without history of COVID or between those with and without Kansas GWI exclusionary conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of olfactory and cognitive deficits and a significant correlation between UPSIT and MoCA scores in a cohort of 80 deployed GW veterans, 99% of whom had CMI. Because impaired olfactory function has been associated with increased risk for MCI and dementia, it may be prudent to screen aging, deployed GW veterans with smell identification tests so that hypo- and anosmic veterans can be followed longitudinally and offered targeted neuroprotective therapies as they become available.

7651444|t|The anterior olfactory nucleus in Parkinson's disease.
7651444|a|Impaired olfaction occurs in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and Lewy bodies have been found in the olfactory bulb and tract. We now confirm the latter finding and show that this presence of Lewy bodies is associated with significant neuronal loss. A quantitative study of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) was performed in tissue obtained postmortem from seven patients with PD and seven age-matched controls. Neuronal loss was seen in the PD bulb and tracts (p < 0.01), and a strong correlation of neuronal loss with disease duration was detected (R = -0.87). The presence of Lewy bodies was confirmed with immunocytochemical staining for ubiquitin in all the PD cases.

20223708|t|Relevance of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity and reduced odor identification in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.
20223708|a|BACKGROUND: Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity determined by transcranial sonography (TCS) and olfactory dysfunction are common findings in Parkinson disease (PD), which may reveal a prodromal synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). METHODS: TCS and the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) were performed in 34 consecutive patients with iRBD (67.9+/-6.1years), 17 consecutive patients with PD (66.4+/-6.7years), and 21 control group subjects (64.4+/-5.8years). RESULTS: There was a significantly increased area of echogenicity in the SN in the iRBD group (0.20+/-0.13cm2) and PD group (0.22+/-0.11cm2) compared with the control group (0.06+/-0.06cm(2)). We found pathological SN hyperechogenicity (0.20cm2) in 41.2% of the iRBD group, 52.6% of the PD group, and 9.5% of the control group. Further, there were abnormal findings of both pathological SN hyperechogenicity (0.20cm2) and functional anosmia or hyposmia in 4 (11.8%) or 9 (26.5%) of the iRBD group subjects, respectively, and 7 (57.9%) or 2 (11.8%) of the PD group subjects, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pathological SN hyperechogenic abnormality and functional anosmia in iRBD may be a disease state in the transition to a neurodegenerative disease.

24554308|t|Olfactory bulb involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.
24554308|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mild cognitive impairment heralding its progression to dementia. The neuropathologic changes of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases may involve the olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb/tract, primary olfactory cortices, and their secondary targets. Olfactory dysfunction is related to deposition of pathological proteins, alpha-synuclein, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofilament protein in these areas, featured by neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies and neurites inducing a complex cascade of molecular processes including oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and cytosolic disruption of cellular processes leading to cell death. Damage to cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems is likely involved, since such damage is most marked in those diseases with severe anosmia. Recent studies of olfactory dysfunction have focused its potential as an early biomarker for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders and their disease progression. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on neuropathological and pathophysiological changes of the olfactory system in the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD and synucleinopathies. We also present neuropathological findings in the olfactory bulb and tract in a large autopsy cohort (n = 536, 57.8 % female, mean age 81.3 years). The severity of olfactory bulb HPtau, Abeta, and alphaSyn pathology correlated and increased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing neuritic Braak stages, Thal Abeta phases, and cerebral Lewy body pathology, respectively. Hence, further studies are warranted to investigate the potential role of olfactory biopsies (possibly restricted to the olfactory epithelium) in the diagnostic process of neurodegenerative diseases in particular in clinical drug trials to identify subjects showing early, preclinical stages of neurodegeneration and to stratify clinically impaired cohorts according to the underlying cerebral neuropathology.

27483429|t|Odor Identification Test in Idiopathic REM-Behavior Disorder and Parkinson's Disease in China.
27483429|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), which is a risk factor in the development of PD. However, a few studies have conflicting results when comparing dysosmia in the patients with iRBD and PD. There is no study investigating the olfactory function in Chinese patients with iRBD. Additionally, the Sniffin' Sticks screening 12 test (SS-12) contains several odors that are not familiar to people in different cultures. METHODS: Odor identification was evaluated in iRBD patients (n = 54), PD patients (n = 54) and healthy controls (n = 54). With the identification data, a brief odor identification test was established and then validated in other subjects. RESULTS: Odor identification scores in iRBD patients were significantly higher than those in PD patients (P<0.001) but lower than those in controls (P<0.001). At the cut-off value of 7.5, the Sniffin' Sticks clearly differentiated iRBD and PD patients from the controls, and the brief test could increase the specificity in diagnosing PD. Neither the Sniffin' Sticks nor the brief test could clearly differentiate PD and iRBD patients from each other. CONCLUSIONS: Olfaction is more impaired in PD patients than in iRBD patients, possibly due to the heterogeneity of iRBD patients. The Sniffin' Sticks could be a useful tool for differentiating iRBD patients from the healthy population, and it could be useful for screening people at high-risk of PD in China, especially when combined with polysomnography. To reduce the expense and time required for the Sniffin' Sticks test, this study shows that a brief test is feasible.

27772753|t|Antioxidant and inflammatory biomarkers for the identification of prodromal Parkinson's disease.
27772753|a|OBJECTIVES: We explored the role of oxidative stress and inflammatory molecules as potential Parkinson (PD) biomarkers and correlated biological with non-motor abnormalities (olfactory impairment and dysautonomia), in patients with idiopathic REM behavior disorder (iRBD) (prodromal PD) and established PD. METHODS: We recruited 11 iRBD and 15 patients with idiopathic PD (Hohen&Yahr 1-3, on L-DOPA and dopamine agonists combination therapy) and 12 age- and sex-matched controls (CTRL). We measured total olfactory score (TOS), autonomic function [deep breathing (DB), lying to standing (LS) and Valsalva manoeuvre (VM) ratios], blood reduced glutathione (Br-GSH), oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (neopterin). RESULTS: Anosmia was similarly prevalent in iRBD (36%) and PD (33%) patients, but absent in CTRL. Orthostatic hypotension was more common among iRBD (73%) and PD (60%) than in CTRL (25%). By univariable ordinal logistic regression, TOS, Br-GSH, LS and VM ratio worsened from CTRL to iRBD and PD groups. Only reduced Br-GSH levels (p=0.037, OR=0.994; 95%CI 0.988-1.000) were independently associated to PD. TOS correlated with Br-GSH (R=0.34, p=0.037), VM ratio (R=0.43, p=0.015), and neopterin (rho=0.39, p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced systemic antioxidant capacity is found in prodromal and overt PD and may represent, in association with olfactory loss and cardiovascular dysautonomia, a useful biomarker for an integrative, early diagnosis of PD.

31935728|t|Inability to Smell Peppermint Is Related to Cognitive Decline: A Prospective Community-Based Study.
31935728|a|BACKGROUND: A few studies have demonstrated the association of poorer olfactory identification (OI) with poorer cognition in population-based cohorts. None of them considered the outcome associated with the inability to smell a certain odor. OBJECTIVE: To verify the hypothesis that at least one specific odor is associated with incident cognitive decline among older adults. METHODS: In the Shanghai Aging Study, a sub-cohort of 948 dementia-free participants who had baseline OI measurements were prospectively followed for 5 years. RESULTS: An inability to smell peppermint (beta = -0.44, p < 0.001), rose (beta = -0.14, p = 0.040), or coffee (beta = -0.37, p = 0.002) was inversely related to the annual rate of change in the Mini Mental State Examination score, and an inability to smell peppermint was associated with a higher risk for incident dementia (hazard ratio 2.67, 95% CI 1.44-4.96) after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that some odors, especially peppermint, might be considered as a potential predictor for dementia in older populations.

6690766|t|Olfactory meningiomas. The missed diagnosis.
6690766|a|Olfactory meningiomas are benign, slow-growing intracranial tumors arising from the dura along the cribriform plate. The first clinical symptom is anosmia followed, usually after several years, by dementia and visual deterioration. A series of 36 patients are presented; in all cases but one, their conditions were diagnosed late and not until the tumor had reached a very large size. By the time the proper diagnosis was made and the tumors were surgically removed, mental or visual disability was often irreversible. Conditions of patients initially seen with anosmia should be investigated by presently available noninvasive diagnostic methods including computed tomographic scanning.

26873234|t|[Impairment of Odor Recognition in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1].
26873234|a|There is evidence that impaired human cognitive abilities are reflected in loss of olfactory abilities. Declining olfactory perception may be a biomarker for impairment of cognitive function and of impending illnesses in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we reported that patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1) had lower sensitivity to emotional facial expressions as well as abnormal olfactory threshold or recognition level. In DM 1, pathological studies have reported neurofibrillary tangles in several temporal areas including the entorhinal cortex (ENT), hippocampus (HI), and the amygdala. We observed that patients with DM 1 showed signal abnormalities in the olfactory limbic areas on magnetic resonance imaging. Our findings underscore the need to pay careful attention to significant decreases in odor identification abilities caused by diverse forms of abnormal brain function, especially in the AMG, ENT and HI.

30651382|t|Impaired olfaction is associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in the brain.
30651382|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine whether impaired olfaction is associated with cognitive decline and indicators of neurodegeneration in the brain of dementia-free older adults. METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 380 dementia-free participants (mean age = 78 years) were followed for up to 15 years, and underwent MRI scans. Olfactory function was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) at baseline, and categorized as anosmia (B-SIT <6), hyposmia (B-SIT 6-10 in men and 6-10.25 in women), and normal (B-SIT 10.25-12 in men and 10.5-12 in women). Cognitive function was annually assessed with a battery of 21 tests, from which composite scores were derived. Structural total and regional brain volumes were estimated. Data were analyzed using linear regression and mixed-effects models. RESULTS: At study entry, 138 (36.3%) had normal olfactory function, 213 (56.1%) had hyposmia, and 29 (7.6%) had anosmia. In multiadjusted mixed-effects models, hyposmia (beta = -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.05 to -0.02) and anosmia (beta = -0.13, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.09) were associated with faster rate of cognitive decline compared to normal olfaction. On MRI, impaired olfaction (hyposmia or anosmia) was related to smaller volumes of the hippocampus (beta = -0.19, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.05), and in the entorhinal (beta = -0.16, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.08), fusiform (beta = -0.45, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.14), and middle temporal (beta = -0.38, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.01) cortices. CONCLUSION: Impaired olfaction predicts faster cognitive decline and might indicate neurodegeneration in the brain among dementia-free older adults.

26025012|t|Selective cognitive and psychiatric manifestations in Wolfram Syndrome.
26025012|a|BACKGROUND: Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is known to involve diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, vision loss, hearing impairment, motor abnormalities, and neurodegeneration, but has been less clearly linked to cognitive, sleep, and psychiatric abnormalities. We sought to determine whether these abnormalities are present in children, adolescents, and young adults with WFS compared to age- and gender-matched individuals with and without type 1 diabetes using standardized measures. METHODS: Individuals with genetically-confirmed WFS (n = 19, ages 7-27) were compared to age- and gender- equivalent groups of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; n = 25), and non-diabetic healthy controls (HC: n = 25). Cognitive performance across multiple domains (verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, memory, attention, smell identification) was assessed using standardized tests. Standardized self- and parent-report questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances were acquired from all groups and an unstructured psychiatric interview was performed within only the WFS group. RESULTS: The three groups were similar demographically (age, gender, ethnicity, parental IQ). WFS and T1DM had similar duration of diabetes but T1DM had higher HbA1C levels than WFS and as expected both groups had higher levels than HC. The WFS group was impaired on smell identification and reported sleep quality, but was not impaired in any other cognitive or self-reported psychiatric domain. In fact, the WFS group performed better than the other two groups on selected memory and attention tasks. However, based upon a clinical evaluation of only WFS patients, we found that psychiatric and behavioral problems were present and consisted primarily of anxiety and hypersomnolence. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that cognitive performance and psychological health were relatively preserved WFS patients, while smell and sleep abnormalities manifested in many of the WFS patients. These findings contradict past case and retrospective reports indicating significant cognitive and psychiatric impairment in WFS. While many of these patients were diagnosed with anxiety and hypersomnolence, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms indicated that the symptoms were not of grave concern to the patients. It may be that cognitive and psychiatric issues become more prominent later in life and/or in later stages of the disease, but this requires standardized assessment and larger samples to determine. In the relatively early stages of WFS, smell and sleep-related symptoms may be useful biomarkers of disease and should be monitored longitudinally to determine if they are good markers of progression as well.

34900915|t|Is Olfactory Impairment Associated With 10-year Mortality Mediating by Neurodegenerative Diseases in Older Adults? The Four-Way Decomposition Analysis.
34900915|a|Background: Literature shows that olfactory impairment (OI) is associated not only with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), but also with increased mortality. In this study, we analyzed data collected from the prospective phase of the 10-year follow-up of the Shanghai Aging Study (SAS) to explore the mediation effect of NDDs on the OI-mortality relationship. Methods: We analyzed data collected from the prospective phase of the 10-year follow-up of the SAS. We included 1,811 participants aged 60 years or older who completed both an olfactory identification test and a cognitive assessment at baseline (2010-2011). Survival status of the participants from baseline to December 31, 2019 was obtained from the local mortality surveillance system. We used the four-way decomposition method to attribute effects to interaction and mediation and to explore the mediation effect of NDDs on the OI-mortality relationship. Results: The four-way decomposition method revealed a statistically significant association of OI with death. Overall, 43% higher risk for death was associated with OI [excess relative risk (ERR) = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.06-0.80, p = 0.023]. Excluding the mediation from NDDs and interaction between OI and NDDs, the controlled direct effect of OI on death was even higher in NDDs participants, with an ERR of 77% (95% CI: 0.00-1.55, p = 0.050). Statistically significant association was found for failure to identify coffee (ERR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.18-1.36, p = 0.010) and marginally significant associations were found for failure to identify cinnamon (ERR = 0.33, 95% CI: -0.02-0.68, p = 0.068) and rose (ERR = 0.33, 95% CI: -0.01-0.67, p = 0.054) with death. Conclusion: OI was associated with the long-term mortality in older adults and the association was even stronger in those with NDDs. Failure to identify coffee or rose was associated with a higher mortality risk, and the association was mediated by NDDs.
