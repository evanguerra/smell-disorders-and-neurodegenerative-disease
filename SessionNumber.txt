3541051|t|Olfaction and Alzheimer's disease.
3541051|a|Disturbances in the sense of smell may be important both clinically and theoretically in Alzheimer's disease. Initial evidence of poor olfactory recognition performance in Alzheimer's and parkinsonian dementias was followed by two reports which corroborated olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. The neuroanatomical and neurochemical bases for this disturbance are discussed. Despite an abundance of preclinical and clinical data linking olfaction with acetylcholine, a preliminary study failed to show any effect of scopolamine on olfactory thresholds. Two of the olfaction-Alzheimer's studies found significantly better performance in other demented groups (alcoholics and patients with vascular dementia), suggesting possible utility in the differential diagnostic workup. The effect of aging per se on olfactory performance cannot be assessed without rigorous control for cognitive dysfunction in sampled populations.

9585920|t|Olfaction in persons with Alzheimer's disease.
9585920|a|The need for low cost, noninvasive procedures for aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has led to theories and procedures examining the role of olfactory disorders because of the finding that the brains of AD patients invariably exhibit neuropathology in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. This loss correlates with the increase in the number of plaques and tangles and with the severity of dementia. Considered together, these findings suggest that brain structures closely related to the olfactory system demonstrate significant histopathology in AD. A comprehensive review of the literature pertaining to olfaction in persons with AD revealed that the olfactory identification ability of patients with memory disorders is impaired relative to controls. Consistency is lacking, however, when olfactory detection thresholds are investigated. Also, there is inconsistency in regards to severity of illness and olfactory function. In addition to differentiating AD patients from normals, the olfactory paradigm has shown some limited usefulness in differentiating AD patients from some other demented patients.

12671941|t|Olfaction in neurodegenerative disorder.
12671941|a|There has been an increase of interest in olfactory dysfunction since it was realised that anosmia was a common feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer-type dementia (AD). It is an intriguing possibility that the first sign of a disorder hitherto regarded as one of movement or cognition may be that of disturbed smell sense. In this review of PD, parkinsonian syndromes, essential tremor, AD, motor neurone disease (MND) and Huntington's chorea (HC) the following observations are made: 1). olfactory dysfunction is frequent and often severe in PD and AD; 2). normal smell identification in PD is rare and should prompt review of diagnosis unless the patient is female with tremor-dominant disease; 3). anosmia in suspected progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration is atypical and should likewise provoke diagnostic review; 4). hyposmia is an early feature of PD and AD and may precede motor and cognitive signs respectively; 5). subjects with anosmia and one ApoE-4 allele have an approximate 5-fold increased risk of later AD; 6). impaired smell sense is seen in some patients at 50% risk of parkinsonism; 7). smell testing in HC and MND where abnormality may be found, is not likely to be of clinical value; and 8). biopsy of olfactory nasal neurons shows non-specific changes in PD and AD and at present will not aid diagnosis.

15107732|t|[Olfactory disorders].
15107732|a|Smell and taste problems are of major importance to those who suffer from olfactory disorders. The inability to determine the presence of odors in the home and the markedly reduced capacity or incapacity to appreciate food flavors are key reasons given for limited social interaction. Patients experiencing distorted smells and tastes may avoid food, which results in weight loss and possible malnutrition. We present an overview of smell disorders, based on physiological considerations, with specific attention to clinical characteristics of conditions most commonly causing smell disorders.

19916845|t|Parkinson's disease, autoimmunity, and olfaction.
19916845|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, mainly classified as a movement disorder which manifests among others nonmotor symptoms such as olfactory dysfunction. The etiopathogenesis of this disease has yet to be elucidated, though it seems to be interconnected with a complex set of genetic, environmental, and immunological interactions. This review unfolds the immune alterations observed in PD patients by describing the increase in the innate immune components including complement and cytokines within their substantia nigra and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These alterations extended to the adaptive immune response with the elevation of T cells and autoantibodies (anti-alpha-synuclein and anti-GM1-ganglioside) in the peripheral blood and CSF of PD patients. Interestingly, another etiopathogenic triad has recently emerged linking PD to autoimmunity through olfactory dysfunction. Smell deficit is one of the earliest signs of PD and a unique observation suggesting olfactory declines to be a consequence of autoimmune mechanisms. Therefore, we considered several undisputed autoimmune diseases known for their olfactory consequences as template examples that may shed more light on the relationship between autoimmunity and PD. We hope that understanding the nature of this disease may lay the ground for successes in the quest to halt the progressive neurodegenerative process.

22584158|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson disease.
22584158|a|Olfactory dysfunction is among the earliest nonmotor features of Parkinson disease (PD). Such dysfunction is present in approximately 90% of early-stage PD cases and can precede the onset of motor symptoms by years. The mechanisms responsible for olfactory dysfunction are currently unknown. As equivalent deficits are observed in Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, and the Parkinson-dementia complex of Guam, a common pathological substrate may be involved. Given that olfactory loss occurs to a lesser extent or is absent in disorders such as multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy, olfactory testing can be useful in differential diagnosis. The olfactory dysfunction in PD and a number of related diseases with smell loss correlates with decreased numbers of neurons in structures such as the locus coeruleus, the raphe nuclei, and the nucleus basalis of Meynart. These neuroanatomical findings, together with evidence for involvement of the autonomic nervous system in numerous PD-related symptoms, suggest that deficits in cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic function may contribute to the olfactory loss. This Review discusses the current understanding of olfactory dysfunction in PD, including factors that may be related to its cause.

23010543|t|Evaluation of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.
23010543|a|It is known that the olfactory dysfunction is involved in various neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease and motor neuron disease. In particular, the ability to identify and discriminate the odors, as well as the odor threshold, can be altered in these disorders. These changes often occur as early manifestation of the pathology and they are not always diagnosed on time. The aim of this review is to summarize the major neurological diseases which are preceded or accompanied by olfactory dysfunction. In addition, new instrumental approaches, such as psychophysical testing, olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements, supported by olfactometer for the stimuli delivery, and their combination in evaluation of olfactory function will be discussed. In particular, OERPs and fMRI might to be good candidates to become useful additional tools in clinical protocols for early diagnosis of neurological diseases.

23263541|t|In vivo neurochemical imaging of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
23263541|a|Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been attributed to early deposition of alpha-synuclein pathology in olfactory areas. The pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD, however, remains poorly understood. Changes in odor identification suggest in part impairment in odor memory, possibly due to hippocampal dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction occurs also in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases with severity of dementia. Cholinergic degeneration is not only a feature of AD but can also occur in PD, at least in a subset of patients with cognitive changes. We reported previously that impaired odor identification in early PD is more closely correlated with hippocampal dopaminergic than nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. Results of our multi-tracer PET studies show that odor identification deficits in PD are best predicted by cholinergic denervation and to a lesser extent by dopaminergic denervation. These results suggest that olfactory dysfunction in PD may have multiple components including hippocampal dysfunction secondary to cholinergic and dopaminergic denervations. Olfactory dysfunction in PD may be the most marked in subjects at risk of incipient dementia, and may reflect the transition of PD toward a stage with more heterogeneous multi-system neurodegenerations. Our preliminary imaging data do not support a significant contribution of amyloidopathy or serotoninergic denervation to abnormal olfactory functions in PD, at least in the absence of dementia. We outline how progressive changes in olfaction may be used as a biomarker of cholinergic denervation and cognitive decline in PD patients. We will discuss also the utility of olfactory testing as an early screening test for neurodegeneration.

23638935|a|Chemosensory disorders of smell or taste in humans have been attributed to various physiological and environmental factors including aging and disease conditions. Aroma and taste greatly condition our food preference, selection and, consumption; the decreased appetite in patients with known neurodegenerative diseases may lead to dietary restrictions that could negatively impact nutritional and health status. The decline in olfactory and gustatory systems in patients with Alzheimer disease and various types of stroke are described.

24078166|t|Taste performance in Parkinson's disease.
24078166|a|While olfactory deficit is already known to be associated with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), taste perception has not fully clarified so far. In this study, we investigated the taste performance in 61 patients with PD and 66 healthy controls (HC) using the Whole Mouth (WMT) and Taste Strip Tests (TST). In addition, we evaluated their olfactory function by means of the Sniffin' Sticks Test (SST). TST score was significantly lower in PD patients than in HC (TST score 11.0 +- 2.8 vs. 12.2 +- 2.1; p<0.018) while WMT showed no difference. The olfactory evaluation confirmed the results reported in the literature with a significant reduction of the SST score in PD patients than in HC (SST score 7.0 +- 2.8 vs. 11.3 +- 2.8; p<0.0001). The conflicting results revealed by TST and WMT could rely on a taste impairment not detectable at supra-threshold concentration of tastes, typical of the daily life. Possible biological correlates of taste impairment in PD are discussed.

24322062|t|A clinical approach towards smell loss in Parkinson's disease.
24322062|a|Impairment of olfaction is a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent data indicate that >90% of patients with PD are diagnosed with significant olfactory loss. The olfactory loss in PD has a bilateral and general character and all olfactory domains are involved. By clinical measurements, the olfactory deficit in PD is independent of disease severity and duration. Imaging studies however, point out that the olfactory impairment may be progressive in the early motor stages. Deficits in the sense of smell may precede clinical motor symptoms by years and can be used to assess the risk for developing PD in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Numerous studies suggest that olfactory disturbances in PD may have diagnostic utility for the differentiation of PD from other movement disorders. This review summarizes the available information about the character of olfactory function in PD and possible therapeutic strategies. It indicates the advantageous use of olfactory probes as a contribution to early and differential diagnosis.

24625830|t|Olfactory dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson's disease.
24625830|a|Dementia is one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the development of dementia is still difficult to predict at early stages of the disease. We recently found that hyposmia, one of the most typical non-motor features of PD, was a predictive feature of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). In that work, multivariate logistic analysis identified severe hyposmia and visuoperceptual impairment as independent risk factors for subsequent dementia within 3 years. The patients with severe hyposmia had an 18.7-fold increase in their risk of dementia for each 1 SD (2.8) decrease in scores on the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J). We also found an association between severe hyposmia and a specific pattern of cerebral metabolic decline, which was identical to findings observed in PDD. Furthermore, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analyses demonstrated close relationships between olfactory dysfunction and atrophy of focal brain structures, including the amygdala and other limbic structures. Our findings suggest that brain regions related to olfactory function are closely associated with cognitive decline and that severe hyposmia is a prominent clinical feature that predicts the subsequent development of PDD. We have now started a randomized, double-blind study using donepezil for the PD group with severe hyposmia. We hope that this clinical trial will allow us to establish a therapeutic intervention that can improve the prognosis of advanced PD.

24833119|t|History of smoking and olfaction in Parkinson's disease.
24833119|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory dysfunction is the most common pre-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), and smoking is known to be associated with lower risk of PD. This study tested the hypothesis that smoking is associated with better olfaction in PD. METHODS: Smoking history was obtained from 76 PD subjects (22 with a history of smoking [smokers], 54 who never smoked [nonsmokers]), and 70 controls (17 smokers, 53 nonsmokers). Olfaction was assessed using the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The olfactory scores between groups and subgroups were compared using analysis of covariance with adjustment for age, gender, and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor usage. RESULTS: Overall the olfactory score was lower in PD compared with controls (olfactory scores: 21.5 vs. 33.5, P < 0.0001). Among controls, there was no significant difference in olfaction between smokers and nonsmokers (olfactory scores, 33.2 vs. 34.2; P = 0.95). Among PD subjects, however, smokers scored significantly better regarding olfaction compared with nonsmokers (olfactory scores: 24.4 vs. 19.9, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a history of smoking is associated with better olfaction among PD patients. The finding may be related to why smoking may be protective against PD. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding and investigate the underlying mechanisms.

25003804|t|Olfactory markers of depression and Alzheimer's disease.
25003804|a|Depression and Alzheimer's disease are two common and closely intertwined diseases in the elderly. Bio-markers for their early diagnosis would be helpful for clinicians. The brain areas involved in depression, Alzheimer's disease and in olfactory processing overlap, leading to suggestions that olfaction could constitute a potential marker of these diseases. Here, we review the literature in the relevant clinical and olfactory fields, and consider which olfactory measures and factors could serve as markers of these diseases. It has been reported repeatedly that there is an alteration of odor identification in Alzheimer's disease but not in depression. These observations provide strong arguments that this olfactory marker may serve as a complementary tool for the early screening of patients. Odor threshold detection and odor hedonic aspect may constitute complementary markers of the efficacy of depression therapy. However, there are numerous contradictory data and innovative methods are required to investigate whether investigations of olfaction can usefully contribute to routine clinical practice.

25304170|t|[Changes in olfaction during ageing and in certain neurodegenerative diseases: up-to-date].
25304170|a|Olfaction is a complex sensory system, and increasing interest is being shown in the link between olfaction and cognition, notably in the elderly. In this literature review, we revisit the specific neurophysiological features of the olfactory system and odorants that lead to a durable olfactory memory and an emotional memory, for which the implicit component produces subconscious olfactory conditioning. Olfaction is known to affect cognitive abilities and mood. We also consider the impairment of olfactory function due to ageing and to neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, through anatomopathological changes in the peripheral and central olfactory structures. The high frequency of these olfactory disorders as well as their early occurrence in Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease are in favour of their clinical detection in subjects suffering from these two neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we analyse the impact of olfactory stimulation on cognitive performance and attention. Current observational data from studies in elderly patients with Alzheimer-type dementia are limited to multiple sensory stimulation methods, such as the Snoezelen method, and aromatherapy. These therapies have shown benefits for dementia-related mood and behaviour disorders in the short term, with few side effects. Since olfactory chemosensory stimulation may be beneficial, it may be proposed in patients with dementia, especially Alzheimer-type dementia, as a complementary or even alternative therapy to existing medical strategies.

25594420|t|Smell identification function and Alzheimer's disease: a selective review.
25594420|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update of the recent studies on the olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on the olfactory identification function. RECENT FINDINGS: The studies reviewed here confirm previous reports on the poor olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease compared to health normal controls and also as a marker for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. Olfactory identification function has been associated with severity of illness, non-cognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and structural and functional MRI measures. There is a possible interaction of apolipoprotein E genotype with olfactory performance in Alzheimer's disease patients and those at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Usefulness of smell identification function in differentiating Alzheimer's disease patients from other types of dementia needs to be established. SUMMARY: The need for simple, inexpensive and non-invasive procedures for aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of Alzheimer's disease has led to theories and procedures examining the role of olfactory functions in Alzheimer's disease. Although there is increasing evidence for olfactory dysfunction in general and impaired odour identification in particular in Alzheimer's disease, additional larger and methodologically sound research is needed for testing its clinical utility in day-to-day clinical practice for early, accurate and differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

25846906|t|Olfactory function in Parkinson's Disease - effects of training.
25846906|a|BACKGROUND: Up to 90% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit olfactory dysfunction, but little is known about the effects of olfactory training. The study aim was to investigate whether the ability to identify olfactory stimuli can be improved by means of a brief training session. Furthermore, the impact of hyposmia on quality of life in PD was investigated by means of a questionnaire. METHODS: Olfactory function was rated in 34 patients with PD and in 26 controls before and after a training session. An additional 20 patients with PD served as a control group and were tested twice without an intervening training session. Long-term effects were evaluated in a small subset of patients. Cognitive tests and DaT SPECT scans were performed. RESULTS: We demonstrated significant same-day and long-term training effects in trained PD patients compared with non-trained PD patients. A slightly significant correlation was seen between the training effect and DaT putamen values, but not with cognitive test scores. Furthermore, patients with PD reported that hyposmia significantly decreased their quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PD improved the number of correctly identified odors in an olfactory test through a brief training session. Olfactory training may have potential in rehabilitation of patients with PD.

26003671|t|Olfaction deterioration in cognitive disorders in the elderly.
26003671|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases are widespread neurodegenerative pathologies. Parkinson's disease affects about 1 % of the population over the age of 65 years, while Alzheimer is considered the most common cause of dementia, with an annual incidence of 1 % in persons aged 65 years. It has been demonstrated that both these neurodegenerative diseases are associated with smell dysfunction. AIM: The aim of the present review is to describe briefly modern olfactory evaluation tools as well as the importance of olfactory sensitivity screening in the elderly, especially where cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, are suspected. METHODS: A brief literature review focusing on the basic principle of smell tests is illustrated together with their application in elderly patients affected by cognitive disorders, in particular Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are both neurodegenerative disorders typically found in the elderly. As both diseases are characterized by the early presence of dysosmia, simple validated smell tests could very well help clinicians in the early diagnosis of these neuropathological conditions. Elderly patients complaining of smell loss and found to be dysosmic, by means of validated olfactory tests, should be neurologically evaluated as early as possible to detect slight motor abnormalities in an at-risk population.

26867087|t|Metacognitive knowledge of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
26867087|a|It is well known that patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) suffer from olfactory impairments, but it is not clear whether patients are aware of their level of deficit in olfactory functioning. Since PD is a neurodegenerative disorder and its progression may be correlated with olfactory loss (Ansari & Johnson, 1975; but see also Doty, Deems, & Stellar, 1988), it is possible that these patients would be subject to metacognitive errors of over-estimation of olfactory ability (White & Kurtz, 2003). Nineteen non-demented PD patients and 19 age-matched controls were each given an objective measure of olfactory identification (the UPSIT, Doty, Shaman, Kimmelman, & Dann, 1984) and a subjective measure involving a questionnaire that asked them to self-rate both their olfactory function generally and their ability to smell each of 20 odors, 12 of which were assessed on the UPSIT. All of the PD patients showed impaired olfactory ability, as did 7 of the controls, according to the UPSIT norms. Self-rated and performance-based olfactory ability scores were significantly correlated in controls (r=.49, p=.03) but not in patients with PD (r=.20, p=.39). When the 12 odors common to both the self-rated questionnaire and UPSIT were compared, PD patients were less accurate than controls (t(36)=-4.96, p<.01) at estimating their own ability and the number of over-estimation errors was significantly higher (tone-tailed(29)=1.80, p=.04) in PD patients than in the control group, showing less metacognitive awareness of their ability than controls. These results support the idea that olfactory metacognition is often impaired in PD, as well as in controls recruited for normosmic ability (Wehling, Nordin, Espeseth, Reinvang, & Lundervold, 2011), and indicate that people with PD generally exhibit over-estimation of their olfactory ability at a rate that is higher than controls. These findings imply that PD patients, unaware of their olfactory deficit, are at greater risk of harm normally detected through olfaction, such as smoke or spoiled foods.

27745824|t|Olfactory Identification Deficits, Cognitive Decline, and Dementia in Older Adults.
27745824|a|Several recently developed biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) are invasive, expensive, and difficult to obtain in most clinical settings. Olfactory identification test performance represents a noninvasive, inexpensive biomarker of AD that may have predictive accuracy comparable with neuroimaging measures and biomarkers assessed in cerebrospinal fluid. Neurofibrillary tangles in the olfactory bulb are among the earliest pathologic features of AD and are also seen in the projection pathways from the olfactory bulb to secondary olfactory brain regions, including the piriform and medial temporal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and other limbic regions. Odor identification impairment characterizes AD and predicts the clinical transition from mild cognitive impairment to AD in both clinical and community samples. Epidemiologic data indicate that in cognitively intact older adults, impairment in odor identification predicts cognitive decline but that episodic verbal memory impairment does not predict cognitive decline. Odor identification impairment has also been shown to predict mortality in older subjects with mortality risk increasing with greater severity of impairment in odor identification. The exact cause of this association is not known, but olfactory deficits may lead to an increase in accidents in the home, because of the inability to smell and taste food that is unsafe or not smelling a gas leak or fire, and this may increase mortality risk. Standardized tests of odor identification ability are widely available and may provide a useful tool to improve diagnostic and predictive accuracy for cognitive decline, AD, and mortality in older adults.

28242255|t|Olfactory dysfunction and dementia in newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease.
28242255|a|INTRODUCTION: Studies report that up to 90% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) have olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia). Hyposmia has also been connected to cognitive impairment and dementia in PD, but no studies of newly diagnosed patients followed longer than three years exists. The present study investigates the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction at PD diagnosis, how it evolves over time and whether hyposmia increases the risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed with Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) in 125 newly diagnosed patients with PD. They were followed for a maximum of 10 years (median six years) with extensive investigations at baseline, 12, 36, 60 and 96 months. Patients with B-SIT<9 were considered hyposmic. RESULTS: Hyposmia was found in 73% of the patients at diagnosis. During the follow up period of ten years 42 (46%) patients with hyposmia at baseline developed dementia compared to seven (21%) of the normosmic patients. Cox proportional hazards model showed that hyposmia at baseline (controlled for age, gender, UPDRS III and Mild Cognitive Impairment) increased the risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio (95%CI): 3.29 (1.44-7.52), p = 0.005). Only one of 22 patients with normal cognition and normal olfaction at baseline developed dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction was common at the time of PD diagnosis and increased the risk of dementia up to ten years after PD diagnosis regardless of baseline cognitive function. Normal olfaction together with normal cognition at baseline predicted a benign cognitive course up to ten years after diagnosis.

28282535|t|Olfactory function in neuropsychiatric disorders.
28282535|a|Recent clinical studies have identified olfactory dysfunction in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Although these studies showed differences in olfactory function between healthy individuals and neuropsychiatric patients, no studies have compared the differences in olfactory function among neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate olfactory function among various neuropsychiatric disorders. Three-hundred and eighteen outpatients diagnosed according to the ICD-10 code participated in the study. Olfactory function was assessed using the Open Essence test. The differences in olfactory function among disorders were compared by analyses of (co-)variance. As expected, olfactory function was significantly affected by the age and marginally affected by the gender. We investigated the differences in olfactory function among patients with different neuropsychiatric disorders (F0-F9). Olfactory function significantly differed among the diagnostic groups. Post hoc analysis showed that patients with F0 had decreased olfactory function compared to patients from the other diagnostic groups. In particular, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) had significantly poorer olfactory function compared to patients with other neuropsychiatric disorders. There were no differences among the other groups. These findings suggest that patients with AD had poorer olfactory function compared not only to healthy subjects but also to patients with several other neuropsychiatric disorders.

28424103|t|Olfactory disturbances in ageing with and without dementia: towards new diagnostic tools.
28424103|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory disorders increase with age and often affect elderly people who have pre-dementia or dementia. Despite the frequent occurrence of olfactory changes at the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, olfactory disorders are rarely assessed in daily clinical practice, mainly due to a lack of standardised assessment tools. The aims of this review were to (1) summarise the existing literature on olfactory disorders in ageing populations and patients with neurodegenerative disorders; (2) present the strengths and weaknesses of current olfactory disorder assessment tools; and (3) discuss the benefits of developing specific olfactory tests for neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: A systematic review was performed of literature published between 2000 and 2015 addressing olfactory disorders in elderly people with or without Alzheimer's disease or other related disorders to identify the main tools currently used for olfactory disorder assessment. RESULTS: Olfactory disorder assessment is a promising method for improving both the early and differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the current lack of consensus on which tests should be used does not permit the consistent integration of olfactory disorder assessment into clinical settings. CONCLUSION: Otolaryngologists are encouraged to use olfactory tests in older adults to help predict the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Olfactory tests should be specifically adapted to assess olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease patients.

28802932|t|Anosmia and Ageusia in Parkinson's Disease.
28802932|a|Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, is a common nonmotor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Ageusia, the loss of sense of taste, is additionally an underappreciated nonmotor feature of PD. The olfactory tract is involved early in PD as indicated by frequent occurrence of hyposmia or anosmia years or decades before motor symptoms and by autopsy studies showing early synuclein pathology in the olfactory tract and anterior olfactory nucleus even in the early stages of PD. Testing for olfaction consists of evaluation of olfactory thresholds, smell identification and discrimination, and olfactory memory. Testing for gustation involves evaluating thresholds and discrimination of five basic tastes (salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami). The presence of a specific pattern of loss in both olfaction and gustation in PD has been proposed, but this has not yet been confirmed. Within PD, olfactory loss is strongly tied with cognitive status though links to other features of PD or a particular PD phenotype is debated. Hyposmia is more often present and typically more severe in PD patients than other parkinsonian syndromes, making it a potentially useful biomarker for the disease.

28831680|t|Olfactory Dysfunction as an Early Biomarker in Parkinson's Disease.
28831680|a|Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and often predates the diagnosis by years, reflecting early deposition of Lewy pathology, the histologic hallmark of PD, in the olfactory bulb. Clinical tests are available that allow for the rapid characterization of olfactory dysfunction, including tests of odor identification, discrimination, detection, and recognition thresholds, memory, and tests assessing the build-up of odor intensity across increasing suprathreshold stimulus concentrations. The high prevalence of olfactory impairment, along with the ease and low cost of assessment, has fostered great interest in olfaction as a potential biomarker for PD. Hyposmia may help differentiate PD from other causes of parkinsonism, and may also aid in the identification of "pre-motor" PD due to the early pathologic involvement of olfactory pathways. Olfactory function is also correlated with other non-motor features of PD and may serve as a predictor of cognitive decline. In this article, we summarize the existing literature on olfaction in PD, focusing on the potential for olfaction as a biomarker for early or differential diagnosis and prognosis.

29128987|t|Comparison of olfactory and gustatory disorders in Alzheimer's disease.
29128987|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop olfactory and gustatory disorders. However, the order of failure and relevance of the pathophysiology are unclear. We compared olfactory identification and whole mouth gustation in patients with AD to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to healthy controls (HC) and assessed correlations with pathophysiology. Patients with AD (n = 40), MCI (n = 34), and HC (n = 40) were recruited. We performed the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J), gustatory test by the intraoral dropping method using taste solutions, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale Japanese version (ADAS-J cog), Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS), and measurement of amyloid beta (Abeta) 42 and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients with AD and MCI had lower OSIT-J scores than did the HC. The OSIT-J score was correlated with the MMSE, ADAS-J cog, TDAS, and Abeta42 results. There were no significant differences in the gustatory test scores among the three groups. The gustatory test score was only correlated with the MMSE, ADAS-J cog, and TDAS results. Olfactory function decreased in AD and MCI patients and was associated with CSF biomarker levels and cognitive disorders. The results suggest that olfactory function is impaired in early stage of AD. Gustatory function was not correlated with CSF biomarkers, which suggests that it may not be impaired in early stage of AD.

29783156|t|Transient impairment of olfactory threshold in acute multiple sclerosis relapse.
29783156|a|BACKGROUND: Impairment of olfactory threshold is a feature of early and active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It predicts inflammatory disease activity and was reported to be transient. However, the timing of onset and resolve of olfactory threshold impairment remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the development of olfactory threshold in acute MS relapse over time in comparison to stable MS patients. METHODS: In a prospective observational design, we measured olfactory threshold by performing the Sniffin' Sticks test (minimum score 0, maximum score 16 reflecting optimal olfactory function) at baseline and after 4, 12 and 24 weeks. We included 30 RRMS patients with acute MS relapse and 30 clinically stable RRMS patients (defined as no relapse within the last 12 months) as a control group. RESULTS: Olfactory threshold was impaired in patients with acute MS relapse at baseline (median difference = -3.5; inter-quartile range [IQR] -4.5- - 2.5; p < 0.001), week 4 (-2.5; IQR -3.0 - -2.0; p < 0.001), week 12 (-1.5; IQR -2.0 - -0.5; p = 0.002) and week 24 (-0.5; IQR -1.0 - 0.0; p = 0.159) compared to stable MS patients. Of note, in relapsing patients in whom disease-modifying treatment was initiated or escalated after relapse, threshold did not differ anymore from stable patients at week 12 (-0.5; IQR -1.0 - 0.5; p = 0.247) and week 24 (0.0; IQR -1.0 - 1.0; p = 0.753). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory threshold impairment seems to be a transient bystander feature of MS relapse. It may be correlated to the level of inflammation within the CNS and might be a useful biomarker in this regard.

29904888|t|Olfactory Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
29904888|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The sense of smell is today one of the focuses of interest in aging and neurodegenerative disease research. In several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, the olfactory dysfunction is one of the initial symptoms appearing years before motor symptoms and cognitive decline, being considered a clinical marker of these diseases' early stages and a marker of disease progression and cognitive decline. Overall and under the umbrella of precision medicine, attention to olfactory function may help to improve chances of success for neuroprotective and disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of olfaction, as clinical marker for neurodegenerative diseases is helpful in the characterization of prodromal stages of these diseases, early diagnostic strategies, differential diagnosis, and potentially prediction of treatment success. Understanding the mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction is central to determine its association with neurodegenerative disorders. Several anatomical systems and environmental factors may underlie or contribute to olfactory loss associated with neurological diseases, although the direct biological link to each disorder remains unclear and, thus, requires further investigation. In this review, we describe the neurobiology of olfaction, and the most common olfactory function measurements in neurodegenerative diseases. We also highlight the evidence for the presence of olfactory dysfunction in several neurodegenerative diseases, its value as a clinical marker for early stages of the diseases when combined with other clinical, biological, and neuroimage markers, and its role as a useful symptom for the differential diagnosis and follow-up of disease. The neuropathological correlations and the changes in neurotransmitter systems related with olfactory dysfunction in the neurodegenerative diseases are also described.

29936148|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease- and Lewy body-related cognitive impairment.
29936148|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction is common in Alzheimer's disease- and Lewy body-related disorders, but its neural correlates have not been clearly elucidated. METHODS: We retrospectively recruited 237 patients with Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive impairment (ADCI) and 217 with Lewy body-related cognitive impairment (LBCI). They were identically evaluated using the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test, neuropsychological tests, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: LBCI had more severe olfactory dysfunction than ADCI. Patients with more severe cognitive dysfunction had worse olfactory function in both groups. In ADCI, lower Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test scores correlated with a lower cortical thickness in brain regions typically affected in Alzheimer's disease, most prominently in the right parahippocampal cortex, whereas in LBCI, the scores correlated with white matter abnormalities in regions vulnerable to Lewy body, including subcortical regions of the orbitofrontal and frontoparietal cortices. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that cortical atrophy in ADCI and white matter abnormalities in LBCI play important roles in olfactory dysfunction.

30100363|t|Chemosensory perception is specifically impaired in Parkinson's disease.
30100363|a|Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) exhibit a considerably diminished sense of smell. The olfactory system is intimately connected to the trigeminal system, responsible for the perception of sensations such as freshness, warmth or piquancy in odorants. Usually, olfactory impairment is associated with a similar reduction of trigeminal sensitivity. A recent study suggests that the trigeminal system is not affected in patients with PD. To test this, we evaluated perception of mixed olfactory/trigeminal stimuli in 23 patients with idiopathic PD and compared them to 22 healthy matched controls. More specifically, we evaluated the trigeminal dimensions of coolness, warmth and piquancy and the olfactory dimensions of pleasantness, familiarity and edibility of 10 mixed olfactory/trigeminal odorants using Likert scale. We show that PD patients perceive trigeminal sensations of coolness, warmth, and piquancy of odorants equally well as controls, as opposed to olfactory dimensions that are perceived significantly less compared to controls (p < 0.001). Moreover, Chi-square Tests show that equal number of participants in both groups perceive the trigeminal dimensions of odorants. Thus, we provide further evidence that the trigeminal system, as opposed to the olfactory system, is not impaired in PD patients reflecting a specific pattern of chemosensory impairment in PD.

30273697|t|Olfactory function and cognition in relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis.
30273697|a|BACKGROUND: Both cognition and olfaction are impaired in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about the relationship between smell identification ability and measures of cognitive function in this disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess olfactory function in MS and to evaluate its relationship with cognitive and physical disability. METHODS: Fifty-five MS patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were tested. The University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT) was administered to assess olfactory function. Cognitive function was tested using the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), California verbal learning test-II (CVLT II), brief visuospatial memory test (BVMT), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), and controlled oral word association test (COWAT). Fatigue and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory II, respectively. RESULTS: MS patients had lower UPSIT scores than those of the HCs (28.76 +- 5.48 vs 31.7 +- 2.18, p = 0.02), with secondary-progressive and cognitively impaired MS patients showing the greatest impairment. Scores on the SDMT, CVLTII, BVMT and COWAT were related to the olfactory test scores. CONCLUSION: We confirm that olfactory function is impaired in MS, particularly in progressive phenotypes, and show, for the first time, that such dysfunction is related to a broad range of cognitive measures. Our data suggest that olfactory dysfunction might be considered as an indirect measure of MS severity. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this possibility.

30414359|t|Olfaction and Colour Vision: What Can They Tell Us about Parkinson's Disease?
30414359|a|Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with the pathological accumulation of alpha synuclein in the brain and peripheral nerve tissue. Early stages of synucleinopathies, often present clinically with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder (RBD). Clinical markers that indicate early progression from RBD to manifest synucleinopathies include abnormal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, motor and non-motor symptoms. Despite the high diagnostic strength of DAT imaging and motor abnormalities, they are not the earliest biomarkers. Non-motor signs of neurodegeneration such as colour vision and olfaction abnormalities are detectable by clinical examination as early as 20 years before disease onset. Detailed analysis of olfactory and colour vision dysfunction can provide valuable information regarding brain pathologies, further specifying clinical phenotypes, and giving clues to underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in Parkinson's disease and related disorders.

30532084|t|Olfactory and other sensory impairments in Alzheimer disease.
30532084|a|The vast increase in Alzheimer disease (AD) worldwide has grave implications for individuals, family support systems and the health-care systems that will attempt to cope with the disease. Early markers of the disease are essential for efficient selection of clinical trial participants for drug development and for timely treatment once an intervention becomes available. There is avid interest in noninvasive, inexpensive markers that have the potential to identify prodromal AD. This Review considers sensory impairments that have the potential to serve as early indicators of AD, with a focus on olfaction, hearing and vision. Current evidence regarding the potential markers of AD in each modality is examined, with a particular emphasis on olfaction and current findings that olfactory function is associated with prodromal AD. Research suggests that olfactory impairment is associated with other markers that signal the emergence of prodromal AD. Auditory impairment is associated with dementia in epidemiological studies and visual system deficits have been reported in AD; however, the emergence of these deficits in prodromal AD is unclear. Further research is necessary to address the relative sensitivity and specificity of olfactory, auditory and visual measures for the detection of prodromal AD.

30565695|t|Olfactory function in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis.
30565695|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory function is altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD); therefore, it may serve as a useful tool for the early detection of MCI before its advancement to AD. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate olfactory deficits in patients with MCI and AD. STUDY DESIGN: Literature search. METHODS: A search was conducted of the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from their inception until 2017. We included original articles with adequate data on the identification, threshold, and/or discrimination of olfactory function in MCI or AD. The standard mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The studies were weighted according to inverse variance estimates. The effect sizes were categorized as small [Cohen's d = 0.2], medium (d = 0.5), or large (d >= 0.8) based on these methods. Subgroup analyses were performed based on mean age and sex differences between the groups. RESULTS: Twelve articles (reporting 21 effects) examining 563 patients with MCI and 788 patients with AD, were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to MCI, AD had moderate to large heterogeneous effects on olfactory function (Cohen's d = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.78). Olfactory identification tests demonstrated larger effects (d = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.91) than did tests of other olfactory domains. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis results revealed that olfactory identification was more profoundly impaired in patients with AD than in those with MCI. These findings suggest that a simple test of odor identification is valuable in differentiating individuals at a risk of AD. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 129:362-369, 2019.

31291631|t|Olfactory Identification among Various Subtypes of Parkinson Disease.
31291631|a|INTRODUCTION: This study is aimed at investigating the olfactory function among different subtypes of Parkinson disease (PD) and the impact of sex on smell identification test. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used Iran-smell identification test (Iran-SIT). PD severity was determined using a Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) scale. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the olfactory function among different PD subtypes. All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 16.0. RESULTS: In total, 66 males and 38 females participated in this study. The most common PD subtype was postural instability and gait difficulty (38.5%). Severe hyposmia and anosmia were found in 44.6 and 19.6% of participants, respectively. Women had a higher score in olfactory function than men (p = 0.44). The score of subjects with stage 1 in the H&amp;Y scale was about 3 points higher than the score with stage 4. The ANCOVA showed a statistically significant effect of subtypes PD on Iran-SIT score after controlling for the effects of covariates (p = 0.03). There is a significant difference between tremor-dominant Parkinson disease (TDPD) and other subtypes of PD (p < 0.05). However, Iran-SIT scores failed to show a significant difference between men and women (p = 0.13). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that PD is heterogeneous and there is significant variability in odor identification ability in these patients. We observed more olfactory impairment in TDPD, and subjects with higher H&amp;Y stage. We recommended future studies with repeated measurements of different aspects of smell function to characterize the temporal relationship of olfactory dysfunction with PD.

31479764|t|Olfactory dysfunction in the pathophysiological continuum of dementia.
31479764|a|Sensory capacities like smell, taste, hearing, vision decline with aging, but increasing evidence show that sensory dysfunctions are one of the early signs diagnosing the conversion from physiological to pathological brain state. Smell loss represents the best characterized sense in clinical practice and is considered as one of the first preclinical signs of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, occurring a decade or more before the onset of cognitive and motor symptoms. Despite the numerous scientific reports and the adoption in clinical practice, the etiology of sensory damage as prodromal of dementia remains largely unexplored and more studies are needed to resolve the mechanisms underlying sensory network dysfunction. Although both cognitive and sensory domains are progressively affected, loss of sensory experience in early stages plays a major role in reducing the autonomy of demented people in their daily tasks or even possibly contributing to their cognitive decline. Interestingly, the chemosensory circuitry is devoid of a blood brain barrier, representing a vulnerable port of entry for neurotoxic species that can spread to the brain. Furthermore, the exposure of the olfactory system to the external environment make it more susceptible to mechanical injury and trauma, which can cause degenerative neuroinflammation. In this review, we will summarize several findings about chemosensory impairment signing the conversion from healthy to pathological brain aging and we will try to connect those observations to the promising research linking environmental influences to sporadic dementia. The scientific body of knowledge will support the use of chemosensory diagnostics in the presymptomatic stages of AD and other biomarkers with the scope of finding treatment strategies before the onset of the disease.

31604550|t|Psychophysical testing of smell and taste function.
31604550|a|The senses of smell and taste are largely underappreciated by laypersons and medical professionals alike. Unlike vision, hearing, balance, and touch, they are rarely evaluated quantitatively in the clinic, even though hundreds of thousands of persons seek medical help annually for disorders of these senses. Chemosensory disorders impact quality of life, including the flavor of foods and beverages, and compromise the ability to detect such environmental hazards as fires, leaking natural gas, and spoiled foodstuffs. Moreover, olfactory dysfunction can be a harbinger for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, and is known to triple the likelihood of mortality in older persons over the course of 4 or 5 years. Without accurate testing, one cannot establish the veracity of a patient's complaint, the probability of malingering, the impact of treatments, and whether the degree of dysfunction is normal relative to a patient's age and sex. This chapter provides basic information as to how to measure both the senses of smell and taste, as well as normative data for several clinical smell and taste tests.

31604557|t|Chemosensory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.
31604557|a|A number of neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by disordered smell function. The degree of dysfunction can vary among different diseases, such that olfactory testing can aid in differentiating, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD) from major affective disorder and Parkinson's disease (PD) from progressive supranuclear palsy. Unfortunately, altered smell function often goes unrecognized by patients and physicians alike until formal testing is undertaken. Such testing uniquely probes brain regions not commonly examined in physical examinations and can identify, in some cases, patients who are already in the "preclinical" stage of disease. Awareness of this fact is one reason why the Quality Standards Committee of the American Academy of Neurology has designated smell dysfunction as one of the key diagnostic criteria for PD. The same recommendation has been made by the Movement Disorder Society for both the diagnosis of PD and identification of prodromal PD. Similar suggestions are proposed to include olfactory dysfunction as an additional research criterion for the diagnosis of AD. Although taste impairment, i.e., altered sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami perception, has also been demonstrated in some disorders, taste has received much less scientific attention than smell. In this review, we assess what is known about the smell and taste disorders of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and describe studies seeking to understand their pathologic underpinnings.

31604561|t|Animal models of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.
31604561|a|Olfactory dysfunction seems to occur earlier than classic motor and cognitive symptoms in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the use of the olfactory system as a clinical marker for neurodegenerative diseases is helpful in the characterization of prodromal stages of these diseases, early diagnostic strategies, differential diagnosis, and, potentially, prediction of treatment success. The use of genetic and neurotoxin animal models has contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. In this chapter, we provide an overview of behavioral and neurochemical alterations observed in animal models of different neurodegenerative diseases (such as genetic and Abeta infusion models for AD and neurotoxins and genetic models of PD), in which olfactory dysfunction has been described.

31744002|t|Is There a Shared Etiology of Olfactory Impairments in Normal Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease?
31744002|a|As we age, our olfactory function declines. In addition to occurring in normal aging, more rapid decrement of olfactory decline has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been argued that since olfactory deficits occur less frequently or are absent in diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and multiple system atrophy, olfactory deficits can be used for differential diagnoses of AD and PD. The purpose of this review is to provide a survey of current knowledge about the molecular bases and differential patterns of olfactory deficits present in normal aging, AD, and PD. As substantial research has been conducted in this area, the majority of the content of this review focuses on articles published in the past decade. We hypothesize that olfactory deficits in normal aging, AD, and PD may have different underlying causes, and propose the use of model organisms with small, tractable nervous systems and/or easy to manipulate genomes to further investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for these deficits.

32493457|t|The human olfactory system in two proteinopathies: Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
32493457|a|Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Their etiologies are idiopathic, and treatments are symptomatic and orientated towards cognitive or motor deficits. Neuropathologically, both are proteinopathies with pathological aggregates (plaques of amyloid-beta peptide and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein in Alzheimer's disease, and Lewy bodies mostly composed of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease). These deposits appear in the nervous system in a predictable and accumulative sequence with six neuropathological stages. Both disorders present a long prodromal period, characterized by preclinical signs including hyposmia. Interestingly, the olfactory system, particularly the anterior olfactory nucleus, is initially and preferentially affected by the pathology. Cerebral atrophy revealed by magnetic resonance imaging must be complemented by histological analyses to ascertain whether neuronal and/or glial loss or neuropil remodeling are responsible for volumetric changes. It has been proposed that these proteinopathies could act in a prion-like manner in which a misfolded protein would be able to force native proteins into pathogenic folding (seeding), which then propagates through neurons and glia (spreading). Existing data have been examined to establish why some neuronal populations are vulnerable while others are resistant to pathology and to what extent glia prevent and/or facilitate proteinopathy spreading. Connectomic approaches reveal a number of hubs in the olfactory system (anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory entorhinal cortex and cortical amygdala) that are key interconnectors with the main hubs (the entorhinal-hippocampal-cortical and amygdala-dorsal motor vagal nucleus) of network dysfunction in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

32753076|t|Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic.
32753076|a|BACKGROUND: Albeit primarily a disease of respiratory tract, the 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been found to have causal association with a plethora of neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychological effects. This review aims to analyze them with a discussion of evolving therapeutic recommendations. METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2020 to 30 May 2020 with the following key terms: "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "pandemic", "neuro-COVID", "stroke-COVID", "epilepsy-COVID", "COVID-encephalopathy", "SARS-CoV-2-encephalitis", "SARS-CoV-2-rhabdomyolysis", "COVID-demyelinating disease", "neurological manifestations", "psychosocial manifestations", "treatment recommendations", "COVID-19 and therapeutic changes", "psychiatry", "marginalised", "telemedicine", "mental health", "quarantine", "infodemic" and "social media". A few newspaper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. RESULTS: Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Clinical features of both central and peripheral nervous system involvement are evident. These have been categorically analyzed briefly with literature support. Most of the psychological effects are secondary to pandemic-associated regulatory, socioeconomic and psychosocial changes. CONCLUSION: Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of this disease are only beginning to unravel. This demands a wide index of suspicion for prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent further complications and mortality.

32818582|t|Olfactory dysfunction in frontotemporal dementia and psychiatric disorders: A systematic review.
32818582|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Diagnosis of FTD, especially the behavioural variant, is challenging because of symptomatic overlap with psychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). Olfactory dysfunction is common in both FTD and psychiatric disorders, and often appears years before symptom onset. This systematic review analysed 74 studies on olfactory function in FTD, depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to identify differences in olfactory dysfunction profiles, focusing on the most common smell measures: odour identification and discrimination. Results revealed that FTD patients were severely impaired in odour identification but not discrimination; in contrast, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia showed impairments in both measures, while those diagnosed with depression showed no olfactory impairments. Findings in bipolar disorder were mixed. Therefore, testing odour identification and discrimination differentiates FTD from depression and schizophrenia, but not from bipolar disorder. Given the high prevalence of odour identification impairments in FTD, and that smell dysfunction predicts neurodegeneration in other diseases, olfactory testing seems a promising avenue towards improving diagnosis between FTD and psychiatric disorders.

33078674|t|Smell your self: Olfactory stimulation improves self-concept in Alzheimer's disease.
33078674|a|Research has demonstrated a link between decline in autobiographical memory and decline in the sense of self in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent work has also shown that odour is a powerful cue to alleviate decline in autobiographical memory in AD. Based on these findings, we investigated whether odour exposure improves access to self-concept in AD patients. To this end, we invited AD and control participants to make self-related statements (i.e., statements in response to the question "Who am I?") after odour exposure or without odour exposure. We measured the number and the categories of self-related statements (i.e., whether these statements described the psychological, social or physical self) that were generated in each condition. Results demonstrated that both AD and control participants generated more self-statements in the odour condition than in the odor-free condition, especially psychological self-statements. This study is the first to demonstrate the positive influence of olfactory stimulation on the retrieval of self-related knowledge in AD.

33168334|t|Olfactory dysfunction in essential tremor versus tremor dominant Parkinson disease.
33168334|a|BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) and tremor dominant Parkinson disease (TDPD) variant constitute the main causes of geriatric tremor which differentiation is not always an easy mission. The objective of this work was to study the olfactory performance in ET and PD patients for possible consideration as a differentiating biomarker. METHODS: This study was performed on 36ET, 22 TDPD variant and 24 healthy controls subjects (HCS) submitted to extended n-butanol Sniffin' Sticks test (SST) and olfactory bulbs volumetry (OBV). RESULTS: There were significant decreases in SST threshold, discrimination, identification and TDI variables in TDPD patients compared to ET and HCS. ET patients showed significant decrease in the same variables compared to HCS. Regarding OBV, there were significant decreases in TDPD patients compared to ET and HCS with nonsignificant difference between the 2-latter groups. Our results showed that TDI score of 25 can differentiate between TDPD and ET patients with sensitivity and specificity (94 %, 91 %) respectively. CONCLUSION: Olfactory assessment is a rapid, safe, and easily applicable biomarker that could differentiate TDPD from ET in doubtful cases.

33236917|t|Olfactory Dysfunction in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Disease-Modifying Therapies.
33236917|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction evaluated with time-consuming tests was more common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) than in controls and correlated with neurological deficit. The aim of the present study was to compare olfactory function between patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and controls with short and simple screening tool-the Sniffin' Sticks Identification Test (SSIT)-and search for its association with clinical and radiological features of the disease. METHODS: The study included 30 controls and 30 patients with RRMS treated with disease-modifying therapies-injectables (interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, N = 18) and oral drugs (dimethyl fumarate or fingolimod, N = 12). Hyposmia was defined as a score of 6 points or fewer in the SSIT olfactory test. The data concerning number of previous relapses, disability in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and recent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were collected. Moreover, thalamic volume and third ventricle width were recorded in every patient. Additionally, cognition and fatigue in patients were evaluated 24 months after olfactory assessment with the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), respectively. RESULTS: Patients with RRMS had a higher risk of hyposmia than controls (66.7% vs 36.7%, OR = 1.82, 95% CI, 1.10-3.67, P = .02). Neither inflammatory (number of previous relapses or new brain MRI lesions) nor neurodegenerative (EDSS, SDMT, and FSMC scores; thalamic volume; third ventricle width) MS features did not correlate with SSIT score (P > .05). In patients treated with oral drugs, olfactory dysfunction correlated with FSMC cognitive subscale (r = -0.90, P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction is nearly twice as common in RRMS as in controls and correlates with fatigue level in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate or fingolimod.

33417193|t|Neurological features and outcome in COVID-19: dementia can predict severe disease.
33417193|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 22 million people worldwide. Although much has been learned about COVID-19, we do not know much about its neurological features and their outcome. This observational study was conducted on the patients of Imam Hossein Hospital, and 361 adult patients (214 males) with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 5, 2020 to April 3, 2020, were enrolled. Data was gathered on age, sex, comorbidities, initial symptoms, symptoms during the disease course, neurological symptoms, and outcome. The mean age of the patients was 61.90 +- 16.76 years. The most common initial symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. In 21 patients (5.8%), the initial symptom was neurological. History of dementia was associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio = 1.28). During the course of the disease, 186 patients (51.52%) had at least one neurological symptom, the most common being headache (109 [30.2%]), followed by anosmia/ageusia (69, [19.1%]), and dizziness (54, [15%]). Also, 31 patients had neurological complications (8.58%). Anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, and headache were associated with favorable outcome (P < 0.001), while altered mental status and hemiparesis were associated with poor outcome. The mortality rate of patients who had neurological complications was more than twice than that of patients without neurological complication (P = 0.008). Almost half of the patients experienced at least one neurological symptom, which may be the initial presentation of COVID-19. Dementia appears to be associated with severe COVID-19. Mortality was higher in patients with neurological complications, and these patients needed more intensive care.

33646153|t|Olfactory Impairment Is Related to Tau Pathology and Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease.
33646153|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory impairment is evident in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, its precise relationships with clinical biomarker measures of tau pathology and neuroinflammation are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine if odor identification performance measured with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is related to in vivo measures of tau pathology and neuroinflammation. METHODS: Cognitively normal and cognitively impaired participants were selected from an established research cohort of adults aged 50 and older who underwent neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and amyloid PET. Fifty-four participants were administered the UPSIT. Forty-one underwent 18F-MK-6240 PET (measuring tau pathology) and fifty-three underwent 11C-PBR28 PET (measuring TSPO, present in activated microglia). Twenty-three participants had lumbar puncture to measure CSF concentrations of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid-beta (Abeta42). RESULTS: Low UPSIT performance was associated with greater18F-MK-6240 binding in medial temporal cortex, hippocampus, middle/inferior temporal gyri, inferior parietal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex (p < 0.05). Similar relationships were seen for 11C-PBR28. These relationships were primarily driven by amyloid-positive participants. Lower UPSIT performance was associated with greater CSF concentrations of t-tau and p-tau (p < 0.05). Amyloid status and cognitive status exhibited independent effects on UPSIT performance (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Olfactory identification deficits are related to extent of tau pathology and neuroinflammation, particularly in those with amyloid pathophysiology. The independent association of amyloid-positivity and cognitive impairment with odor identification suggests that low UPSIT performance may be a marker for AD pathophysiology in cognitive normal individuals, although impaired odor identification is associated with both AD and non-AD related neurodegeneration.NCT Registration Numbers: NCT03373604; NCT02831283.

33831865|t|Olfactory Dysfunction and Cognition in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome and Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.
33831865|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, demyelinating disease that causes cognitive, olfactory, and other neurological dysfunctions. Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS), in which only radiological findings are monitored, is accepted as the preclinical stage of demyelinating disease and is considered an important period for disease pathology. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the olfactory and cognitive functions and their clinical correlation in RIS and Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) patients and a healthy control group. METHODS: Our study included 10 RRMS patients, 10 RIS patients, and 10 healthy controls. We conducted an olfactor evaluation via the "Sniffin' Sticks" test. The subjects underwent a neuropsychometric test battery to evaluate cognitive functions, including memory, visuospatial, and executive functions. Depression was evaluated using the Beck depression scale. Fatigue and daily life activity were evaluated using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), respectively. Disability assessment was done with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). RESULTS: RRMS and RIS patients' olfactory test scores were significantly different from those in the control group (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between the odor threshold scores of patients in the RRMS and RIS groups. There was a significant correlation between memory-oriented cognitive tests and olfactory tests in the RRMS and RIS groups. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction can be seen in RIS patients, like in RRMS patients. Cognitive and olfactory dysfunction may be together a sign of degeneration in demyelinating diseases.

33935102|t|Non-Motor Features of Parkinson's Disease in Women.
33935102|a|BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and some, including hyposmia, constipation, and REM sleep behavior disorder, often precede the clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between combinations of non-motor features and presence of PD among women. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted among women in the Nurses' Health Study. Women were eligible if they responded to screening questions for constipation and probable REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) on a 2012 questionnaire and were under age 85 on January 1, 2012. 87 women with confirmed PD and 14,170 women without PD agreed to participate and completed in 2015 the Brief Smell Identification Test to assess hyposmia, as well as a questionnaire to assess parkinsonism and other non-motor PD features, including depressive symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired color vision, and body pain. RESULTS: In age-adjusted logistic models, each non-motor feature was significantly associated with PD, and the odds of PD increased exponentially with the number of features. Women with constipation, pRBD, and hyposmia had an age-adjusted OR for PD of 211 (95% CI 84.2-529) compared to women with none of these features. The odds of having PD rose further with the presence of additional non-motor signs. Comparing women with at least 6 of the 7 features assessed in this study to women with one or none, the age-adjusted OR for PD was 356 (95% CI 113-1126). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that these non-motor features could be useful in discriminating PD patients from controls in women, and since they often appear during the prodromal period of PD, their combinations may prove useful for identifying populations at high risk of developing PD.

34086764|t|Is either anosmia or constipation associated with cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease?
34086764|a|OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association of anosmia or constipation with cognitive dysfunction and disease severity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with PD (less than 5 years) without a clinical diagnosis of dementia were included from February 2017 to August 2018. The subjects were further divided into subgroups based on whether anosmia occurred and the grade of constipation. The severity of PD motor symptoms was rated using the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), and cognitive functions were evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical analyses including t-tests, chi-square tests, multiple linear regression, and binary logistic regression were used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 107 newly diagnosed PD patients were included in this study. The MoCA score was significantly lower in the anosmia group (p < 0.001). Constipation was associated with impaired olfaction in a post-hoc test. The correlation coefficient between MoCA and UPSIT score was 0.41 (p < 0.001). Total anosmia and age were associated with cognitive dysfunction (MoCA < 26) (odds ratio, 2.63, p = 0.003; 1.10, p < 0.001, respectively). The anosmia group had a higher MDS-UPDRS part 3 score with beta coefficient of 7.30 (p = 0.02). Furthermore, grade 3 constipation was associated with a higher MDS-UPDRS total score with beta coefficient of 14.88 (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia but not constipation was associated with cognitive impairment in PD patients. Nevertheless, severe constipation was associated with impaired olfaction and PD disease severity. We suggest that the propagation of alpha-synuclein from the olfactory route is distinct from the enteric nervous system, but the intercommunication between these two routes is complex.

34162463|t|Olfactory neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease: a sign of ongoing neurodegeneration.
34162463|a|Olfactory neuropathology is a cause of olfactory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with memory and cognitive dysfunction and is an incidental finding of AD dementia. Here we review neuropathological research on the olfactory system in AD, considering both structural and functional evidence. Experimental and clinical findings identify olfactory dysfunction as an early indicator of AD. In keeping with this, amyloid-beta production and neuroinflammation are related to underlying causes of impaired olfaction. Notably, physiological features of the spatial map in the olfactory system suggest the evidence of ongoing neurodegeneration. Our aim in this review is to examine olfactory pathology findings essential to identifying mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in the development of AD in hopes of supporting investigations leading towards revealing potential diagnostic methods and causes of early pathogenesis in the olfactory system.

34266602|t|Olfaction as an early marker of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
34266602|a|Olfactory impairment is a common and early sign of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the two most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions in the elderly. This phenomenon corresponds to pathologic processes emerging in the olfactory system prior to the onset of typical clinical manifestations. Clinically available tests can establish hyposmia through odor identification assessment, discrimination, and odor detection threshold. There are significant efforts to develop preventative or disease-modifying therapies that slow down or halt the progression of PD and AD. Due to the convenience and low cost of its assessment, olfactory impairment could be used in these studies as a screening instrument. In the clinical setting, loss of smell may also help to differentiate PD and AD from alternative causes of Parkinsonism and cognitive impairment, respectively. Here, we discuss the pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD and AD and how it can be assessed in the clinical setting to aid in the early and differential diagnosis of these disorders.

34275910|t|Clinical and Dopamine Depletion Patterns in Hyposmia- and Dysautonomia-Dominant Parkinson's Disease.
34275910|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory or autonomic dysfunction is one of the earliest prodromal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has not been investigated whether PD patients have different phenotypes depending on the presence of these prodromal symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether hyposmia-dominant and dysautonomia-dominant patients with early PD have different clinical manifestations and nigrostriatal degeneration. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 168 drug-naive PD patients and 34 control subjects. PD patients were classified as patients without hyposmia and dysautonomia (PD-H-D-, n = 51), hyposmia-dominant patients (PD-H+D-, n = 36), dysautonomia-dominant patients (PD-H-D+, n = 33), and patients with hyposmia and dysautonomia (PD-H+D+, n = 48). We then compared the baseline clinical characteristics, striatal specific to non-specific binding ratio (SNBR), neuropsychological performance, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among the groups. RESULTS: The PD-H+D-group had a lower SNBR in the ventral striatum (p = 0.013), a greater asymmetric index of striatal SNBRs, and higher prevalence of apathy (p = 0.021) than the PD-H-D+ group. The PD-H-D+ group had older age at onset (p = 0.043) and a higher prevalence of REM sleep behavior disorder (p = 0.041) than the PD-H+D-group. The PD-H+D+ group had higher motor deficits, lower cognitive function, and lower SNBRs in all striatal subregions than the PD-H-D-group. Decreased SNBRs in the anterior caudate, posterior caudate, and ventral striatum were associated with the presence of apathy. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that hyposmia-dominant and dysautonomia-dominant PD have different clinical characteristics and patterns of striatal dopamine depletion.

34325072|t|Olfactory dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
34325072|a|Alterations in olfactory functions are proposed to be early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Many neurodegenerative diseases are age-related, including two of the most common, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The establishment of biomarkers that promote early risk identification is critical for the implementation of early treatment to postpone or avert pathological development. Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is seen in 90% of early-stage PD patients and 85% of patients with early-stage AD, which makes it an attractive biomarker for early diagnosis of these diseases. Here, we systematically review widely applied smelling tests available for humans as well as olfaction assessments performed in some animal models and the relationships between OD and normal aging, PD, AD, and other conditions. The utility of OD as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and future research directions are also discussed.

34328564|t|Olfaction in patients with Parkinson's disease: a new threshold test analysis through turning points trajectories.
34328564|a|Olfactory deficit is a widely documented non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Abnormal turning points trajectories through olfactory threshold testing have been recently reported in patients with olfactory dysfunction, who seem to adapt faster to olfactory stimuli, but data on PD patients are lacking. The aim of this study is to perform olfactory threshold test and explore the turning points trajectories in PD patients in comparison to normal controls. We recruited 59 PD patients without dementia, and no conditions that could influence evaluation of olfaction and cognition. Sixty healthy subjects served as controls. Patients and controls underwent a comprehensive olfactory evaluation with the Sniffin' Sticks extended test assessing threshold, discrimination and identification and a full neuropsychological evaluation. Besides, threshold test data were analyzed examining all the turning points trajectories. PD patients showed a different olfactory threshold test pattern, i.e., faster olfactory adaptation, than controls with no effect of age. Normosmic PD patients showed different olfactory threshold test pattern, i.e., better threshold score, than normosmic controls. Visuospatial dysfunction was the only factor that significantly influenced this pattern. Olfactory threshold trajectories suggested a possible adaptation phenomenon in PD patients. Our data offered some new insights on normosmic PD patients, which appear to be a subset with a specific psychophysical profile. The analysis of the turning points trajectories, through an olfactory threshold test, could offer additional information on olfactory function in PD patients. Future larger studies should confirm these preliminary findings.

34586294|t|Olfative and taste perception in Parkinson's disease.
34586294|a|PURPOSE: To analyze the olfactory and gustatory perception and discrimination and self-perception of smell and taste in people with Parkinson's disease, comparing them with healthy nodes. METHODS: Observational, analytical, cross-sectional, and quantitative study. Olfactory and gustatory perception and discrimination were verified following Parkinson's disease, compared to a control group, matched by sex and age, using the Olfactory Perception and Taste Strips Tests, respectively, after nasal cleaning and oral brushing. Self-perception was assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale before and after specific tests of perception and discrimination. RESULTS: We included individuals of both sexes, 35 with Parkinson's Disease and 20 assigned to the control group, matched for mean age. The olfactory self-perception of the group with Parkinson's disease improved after the olfactory test. There was no difference in taste self-perception in the Parkinson's disease group before and after the taste test. In the olfactory perception assessment test, the Parkinson's disease group discriminated fewer essences than the control group. Both groups have similar generation and taste discrimination. CONCLUSION: The olfactory perception of people with Parkinson's disease was lower, compared to the group of healthy desires, and the self-perception of olfactory efficacy improved after the test, in both groups. As for taste, there was no difference in perception and discrimination between groups, the sour taste was the most identified and there was an improvement in self-perception of taste efficiency in the group without Parkinson's disease after the test.

34666863|t|Olfactory impairment in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.
34666863|a|OBJECTIVES: Impaired olfaction may be a biomarker for early Lewy body disease, but its value in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) is unknown. We compared olfaction in MCI-LB with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that olfactory function would be worse in probable MCI-LB than in both MCI-AD and healthy comparison subjects (HC). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study assessing olfaction using Sniffin' Sticks 16 (SS-16) in MCI-LB, MCI-AD, and HC with longitudinal follow-up. Differences were adjusted for age, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for discriminating MCI-LB from MCI-AD and HC. SETTING: Participants were recruited from Memory Services in the North East of England. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight probable MCI-LB, 33 MCI-AD, 19 possible MCI-LB, and 32HC. MEASUREMENTS: Olfaction was assessed using SS-16 and a questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants with probable MCI-LB had worse olfaction than both MCI-AD (age-adjusted mean difference (B) = 2.05, 95% CI: 0.62-3.49, p = 0.005) and HC (B = 3.96, 95% CI: 2.51-5.40, p < 0.001). The previously identified cutoff score for the SS-16 of <= 10 had 84% sensitivity for probable MCI-LB (95% CI: 69-94%), but 30% specificity versus MCI-AD. ROC analysis found a lower cutoff of <= 7 was better (63% sensitivity for MCI-LB, with 73% specificity vs MCI-AD and 97% vs HC). Asking about olfactory impairments was not useful in identifying them. CONCLUSIONS: MCI-LB had worse olfaction than MCI-AD and normal aging. A lower cutoff score of <= 7 is required when using SS-16 in such patients. Olfactory testing may have value in identifying early LB disease in memory services.

34673938|t|Olfactory loss and aging: connections with health and well-being.
34673938|a|Age-related olfactory dysfunction, or presbyosmia, is a common sensory impairment in aging adults. People in this demographic group with comorbid conditions or exposure to viral, traumatic, or environmental insults remain at the greatest risk for impairment. Several methods for assessing olfaction exist, but they are only available in special settings and require consideration of age, sex, ancestry, and cognition. Perhaps most importantly, olfactory dysfunction has been suggested as an early sign of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and therefore may serve as a tool in the diagnosis and prognosis of these neurodegenerative conditions. Outside of this context, olfactory loss also impacts nutrition, safety, and social relationships, and even predicts mortality itself. This review covers the detection and manifestations of olfactory decline in aging individuals and the myriad ways in which olfactory impairment is connected to their health and well-being.

34719504|t|Olfactory Dysfunction in Huntington's Disease.
34719504|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). Understanding its pathophysiology is important in establishing a preventive and therapeutic plan. In this literature review, we cover the physiology of olfaction, its role in neurodegeneration, and its characteristics in patients with HD. In the general population, olfactory dysfunction is present in 3.8-5.8%and the prevalence increases significantly in those older than 80 years. For HD, data regarding prevalence rates are lacking and the scales used have been inconsistent or have been restructured due to concerns about cross-cultural understanding. Pathogenic huntingtin deposits have been found in the olfactory bulb of individuals with HD, although no studies have correlated this with the grade of olfactory impairment. Olfactory dysfunction is present in both premanifest and manifest patients with HD, showing a progressive decline over time with more severe deficits at advanced stages. No specific treatment for olfactory impairment in HD has been proposed; identifying and avoiding potential medications that cause olfactory dysfunction, as well as general safety recommendations remain the basis of the therapeutic strategy.

34810025|t|A potential biomarker of preclinical Alzheimer's disease: The olfactory dysfunction and its pathogenesis-based neural circuitry impairments.
34810025|a|The olfactory dysfunction can signal and act as a potential biomarker of preclinical AD. However, the precise regulatory mechanism of olfactory function on the neural pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. The impairment of neural networks in olfaction system has been shown to be tightly associated with AD. As key brain regions of the olfactory system, the olfactory bulb (OB) and the piriform cortex (PCx) have a profound influence on the olfactory function. Therefore, this review will explore the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction in preclinical AD in the perspective of abnormal neural networks in the OB and PCx and their associated brain regions, especially from two aspects of aberrant oscillations and synaptic plasticity damages, which help better understand the underlying mechanism of olfactory neural network damages related to AD.

35051386|t|The druggability of bitter taste receptors for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
35051386|a|The delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain remains a major pharmacology challenge. A complex system of chemical surveillance to protect the brain from endogenous and exogenous toxicants at brain barriers hinders the uptake of many compounds with significant in vitro and ex vivo therapeutic properties. Despite the advances in the field in recent years, the components of this system are not completely understood. Recently, a large group of chemo-sensing receptors, have been identified in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Among these chemo-sensing receptors, bitter taste receptors (TAS2R) hold promise as potential drug targets, as many TAS2R bind compounds with recognized neuroprotective activity (quercetin, resveratrol, among others). Whether activation of TAS2R by their ligands contributes to their diverse biological actions described in other cells and tissues is still debatable. In this review, we discuss the potential role of TAS2R gene family as the mediators of the biological activity of their ligands for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and discuss their potential to counteract drug resistance by improving drug delivery to the brain.

35129037|t|The potential utility of smell testing to screen for neurodegenerative disorders.
35129037|a|INTRODUCTION: Loss of smell is a common early feature of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Identifying these conditions in their early stages is important to understand more about early pathophysiological events and the development of disease modifying therapies. Smell testing may be an effective future tool for screening large populations for early neurodegeneration. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we appraise the evidence for, and discuss the likelihood of, the use of smell testing in large screening programs to detect early neurodegeneration. We evaluate the predictive power of smell tests for neurodegenerative disease, compare performance to other established screening programs, and discuss ethical and practical considerations and limitations. EXPERT OPINION: Even if disease modifying therapies were available for neurodegenerative disease, smell tests alone are unlikely to have high enough predictive power to be used in a future screening program. However, we believe they could be a valuable component of a short battery of tests or part of a stepwise process that together could more accurately identify early neurodegeneration in large populations.

35282741|t|Olfactory threshold predicts treatment response in relapsing multiple sclerosis.
35282741|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory threshold (OT) is associated with short-term inflammatory activity in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate OT for prediction of treatment response in RMS. METHODS: In this 5-year prospective study on 123 RMS patients, OT was measured at disease-modifying treatment (DMT) initiation (M0), after 3 months (M3), and 12 months (M12) by Sniffin' Sticks test. Primary endpoint was defined as an absence of relapse during the observation period, with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity being the secondary endpoints. Optimal cutoff values were determined by receiver operating characteristic analyses and their predictive value assessed by multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Higher OT scores at M0, M3, and M12 were independently associated with decreased relapse probability with the strongest risk reduction at M3 (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.44, p < 0.001). Improvement of OT scores from M0 to M3 (DeltaOTM3) was also associated with reduced relapse risk (HR = 0.12, p < 0.001). OT score > 6.5 at M3 was the strongest predictor of relapse freedom (HR = 0.10, p < 0.001) with high diagnostic accuracy (positive predictive value (PPV) = 87%), closely followed by DeltaOTM3 >= 0.5 (HR = 0.12, p < 0.001, PPV = 86%). CONCLUSIONS: OT is an independent predictor of freedom of disease activity upon DMT initiation within 5 years and may be a useful biomarker of treatment response.

35377902|t|Olfactory identification disorders due to Alzheimer's disease: A new test from France to Quebec.
35377902|a|Olfactory identification disorder is regarded as an early marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of similar diagnostic significance of biological or cognitive markers. Premature damage of the entorhinal olfactory cortex, the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex characterize AD and suggest a specific impairment of olfactory identification. The use of psychophysical olfactory identification tests in clinical diagnostic practice is therefore strongly recommended, but not required. As these widespread tests are rarely used, an innovative test, adapted to this target group has been developed. It has been used and validated in a routine care protocol at different Memory Centers in France and in Quebec, Canada. A total of 157 participants were recruited: including 63 Alzheimer's patients and 94 healthy controls. The test was composed of 14 odorants diluted into 4 different concentrations. A computer interface generated randomization of 6 odors per participant and the automatic calculation of identification scores, of perceptual thresholds and of composite scores. All participants underwent a Mini Mental Scale Examination within the previous three months or on the same day of the olfactory test. The Alzheimer's patients had a score between 20 and 30 and healthy controls participants had a score above 28 without any loss of points on recalled items. The results show that our olfactory identification test is able to significantly differentiate Alzheimer's patients from healthy controls (p < 0.001), and to distinguish the French population tested from the Quebec population (p < 0.001). This study highlights an olfactory identification disorder as a target for early diagnosis of AD. Its cultural qualities make it a potential candidate for differentiated calibration between France and Quebec.

35400704|t|Olfactory Dysfunction Reflects Disease Progression in Japanese Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
35400704|a|Objective Olfactory dysfunction is an important clinical feature in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The incidence and extent of olfactory dysfunction are reportedly higher in secondary progressive (SP) MS than in relapsing and remitting (RR) MS. We investigated the use of olfactory dysfunction for evaluating the disease status of Japanese patients with MS. Methods Olfactory identification was evaluated using the Odor Stick Identification Test for the Japanese (OSIT-J) in patients with RRMS (n=40) and SPMS (n=11) and compared the findings with those of healthy controls (n=40). Patients with RRMS for more than 10 years (L-RRMS, n=10) were included in the RRMS group. The cognitive function was evaluated using the Japanese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition. The third ventricle width (3rd VW) was measured as a marker of central brain atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging. Results SPMS patients had significantly lower OSIT-J scores than RRMS and L-RRMS patients. More SPMS patients had OSIT-J scores below the lower limit of the normal score (LLN) than RRMS patients. The LLN effectively discriminated between RRMS and SPMS (sensitivity 70%, specificity 91.5%, area under the curve 0.933, 95% confidence interval 0.874-1.000). Patients with SPMS had a significantly lower processing speed and larger 3rd VW than those with RRMS or L-RRMS. Conclusion The olfactory dysfunction was worse, along with cognitive impairment and brain atrophy, in SPMS patients than in RRMS patients, independent of disease duration, in our Japanese population. This directly reflected the disease progression and may have been able to distinguish SPMS from RRMS, independent of ethnic and cultural background.

35439251|t|Olfactory dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis; A systematic review and meta-analysis.
35439251|a|BACKGROUND: The importance and prevalence of olfactory dysfunction is recently gaining attention in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as a result of their chronic inflammatory disease, yet different prevalence rates are reported for it. Therefore, we have designed this systematic review to estimate the pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in patients with MS. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, and gray literature including references from the identified studies, review studies, and conference abstracts which were published up to January 2021. Articles that were relevant to our topic and could provide information regarding the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, or the scores of smell threshold, discrimination, or identification (TDI) among MS patients and healthy individuals were included. The pooled prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model and a funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to see publication bias. RESULTS: The literature search found 1630 articles. After eliminating duplicates, 897 articles remained. Two conference abstracts were included for final analysis. A total of 1099 MS cases and 299 MS patients with olfactory dysfunction were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the included studies was 27.2%. Also, the overall TDI score in MS patients was lower than that in the control group, and the level of Threshold, Discrimination, and Identification per se were lower in MS compared with control respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review show that the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients is high and more attention needs to be drawn to this aspect of MS.

35508569|t|Olfactory dysfunction and striatal dopamine transporter binding in motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease.
35508569|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). There are contradictory results regarding the association of olfactory dysfunction and dopamine uptake in striatal nuclei among PD patients. It has been suggested that different motor subtypes of PD vary in the disease pathophysiology and progression. Thus, we hypothesized that there might be different associations between olfactory dysfunction and striatal dopaminergic neuronal loss among three motor subtypes of PD, namely, indeterminate, postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), and tremor-dominant (TD). METHODS: We recruited 162 healthy controls (HCs) and 464 drug-naive PD patients from PPMI who underwent common PD scaling tests. Striatal binding ratios (SBRs) of DaTSCAN images in caudate and putamen nuclei were calculated. To assess the olfactory function, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was carried out. RESULTS: The UPSIT score was significantly correlated with MDS-UPDRS part I (p value: 0.002, correlation coefficient: - 0.160), MDS-UPDRS part III (p value: 0.000, correlation coefficient: - 0.248), and SBR score in right (p value: 0.000, correlation coefficient: 0.240) and left caudate (p value: 0.000, correlation coefficient: 0.221) and right (p value: 0.000, correlation coefficient: 0.323) and left putamen (p value: 0.000, correlation coefficient: 0.335) nucleus in TD subtype. There were no significant correlations in HC, PIGD, and indeterminate subjects. CONCLUSION: The olfactory dysfunction was correlated with dopamine transporter activity in striatal nuclei only in the TD subtype. Therefore, the olfactory dysfunction in PIGD and indeterminate subtype may not be a predictive factor for the future decrease in dopamine uptake.

35679630|t|Olfaction and apathy in early idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
35679630|a|BACKGROUND: Apathy remains a disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) with limited therapeutic success. Processing of emotions and smell share neuroanatomical and evolutionary pathways. OBJECTIVES: To explore the association of apathy with smell dysfunction (SD) in early PD. METHODS: We analyzed patients with de-novo PD, with follow-up of at least 5 years from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. SD and apathy were defined using University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and MDS-UPDRS part 1A. Odds ratios were calculated between apathy and olfaction groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was grouped by presence/ absence of smell dysfunction. The Log Rank test was used to compare time to apathy. RESULTS: We found no association between presence of apathy in patients with and without SD (OR 1.01 [0.49-2.08]). There was no significant difference between PD patients with and without SD in time to apathy (p = 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: SD does not portend greater risk of apathy in PD.

35848020|t|Olfactory Bulb Integrity in Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.
35848020|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is highly prevalent in dementia syndromes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The structural integrity of the olfactory bulb (OB) is thought to play a critical role in odor detection and identification, but no MRI study has measured OB volume in FTD, or measured OB volume longitudinally in AD. OBJECTIVE: To measure OB volume in FTD and AD patients longitudinally using MRI. METHODS: This study measured OB volumes using MRI in patients diagnosed with behavioral-variant FTD (n = 55), semantic dementia (n = 34), progressive non-fluent aphasia (n = 30), AD (n = 50), and healthy age-matched controls (n = 55) at their first visit to a dementia research clinic ('baseline'). Imaging data in patients 12-months later were analyzed where available (n = 84) for longitudinal assessment. Volumes of subcortical and cortical olfactory regions ('olfactory network') were obtained via surface-based morphometry. RESULTS: Results revealed that in AD and FTD at baseline, OB volumes were similar to controls, whereas volumes of olfactory network regions were significantly reduced in all patient groups except in progressive non-fluent aphasia. Longitudinal data revealed that OB volume became significantly reduced (10-25% volume reduction) in all dementia groups with disease progression. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction is common in patients diagnosed with AD or FTD, but our results indicate that there is no detectable volume loss to the OBs upon first presentation to the clinic. Our findings indicate that the OBs become detectably atrophied later in the disease process. OB atrophy indicates the potential usefulness for OBs to be targeted in interventions to improve olfactory function.

35848036|t|Taste Impairments in a Parkinson's Disease Model Featuring Intranasal Rotenone Administration in Mice.
35848036|a|BACKGROUND: Taste impairments are often accompanied by olfactory impairments in the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). The development of animal models is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying taste impairments in PD. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to clarify whether the intranasal administration of rotenone causes taste impairments prior to motor deficits in mice. METHODS: Rotenone was administrated to the right nose of mice once a day for 1 or 4 week(s). In the 1-week group, taste, olfactory, and motor function was assessed before and after a 1-week recovery period following the rotenone administration. Motor function was also continuously examined in the 4-weeks group from 0 to 5 weeks. After a behavioral test, the number of catecholamine neurons (CA-Nos) was counted in the regions responsible for taste, olfactory, and motor function. RESULTS: taste and olfactory impairments were simultaneously observed without locomotor impairments in the 1-week group. The CA-Nos was significantly reduced in the olfactory bulb and nucleus of the solitary tract. In the 4-week group, locomotor impairments were observed from the third week, and a significant reduction in the CA-Nos was observed in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) at the fifth week along with the weight loss. CONCLUSION: The intranasal administration of rotenone caused chemosensory and motor impairments in an administration time-period dependent manner. Since chemosensory impairments were expressed prior to the locomotor impairments followed by SN/VTA CA neurons loss, this rotenone administration model may contribute to the clarification of the prodromal symptoms of PD.

35894511|t|COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?
35894511|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a hallmark symptom of COVID-19 disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The cause of the sudden and usually temporary anosmia that most people suffer from COVID-19 is likely entirely peripheral-inflammation and other damage caused by the virus in the sensory epithelium inside the upper recesses of the nasal cavity can damage or prevent chemicals from properly activating the olfactory sensory neurons. However, persistent olfactory dysfunction from COVID-19, in the form of hyposmia and parosmia (decreased or altered smell) may affect as many as 15 million people worldwide. This epidemic of olfactory dysfunction is thus a continuing public health concern. Mounting evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself or inflammation from the immune response in the nasal sensory epithelium may invade the olfactory bulb, likely via non-neuronal transmission. COVID-19-related long-term olfactory dysfunction and early damage to olfactory and limbic brain regions suggest a pattern of degeneration similar to that seen in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia. Thus, long-term olfactory dysfunction coupled with cognitive and emotional disturbance from COVID-19 may be the first signs of delayed onset dementia from neurodegeneration. Few treatments are known to be effective to prevent further degeneration, but the first line of defense against degeneration may be olfactory and environmental enrichment. There is a pressing need for more research on treatments for olfactory dysfunction and longitudinal studies including cognitive and olfactory function from patients who have recovered from even mild COVID-19.NEW & NOTEWORTHY More than 15 million people worldwide experience persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, possibly caused by olfactory bulb damage. SARS-CoV-2 can cause inflammation and viral invasion of the olfactory bulb, initiating a cascade of degeneration similar to Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease. People who have had even mild cases of COVID-19 show signs of degeneration in cortical areas connected with the olfactory system. These data suggest a wave of post-COVID dementia in the coming decades.

36053357|t|Self-awareness of olfactory dysfunction in elderly individuals without neurodegenerative diseases.
36053357|a|PURPOSE: The decrease in smell in the elderly population is frequent and considered a natural process. However, sometimes it can be associated with the decline of cognitive functions, and it is considered a warning for the early stage of neurodegenerative diseases and social impairment. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in previous healthy elderly that attended a tertiary hospital in Brazil as escorts and the clinical alterations associated in this population. METHODS: Subjects 60 years or over attending the University Hospital of Campinas were evaluated. Each participant answered a questionnaire, followed by an otorhinolaryngological exam with flexible nasal endoscopy and the Connecticut smell test produced by the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC). Elderly people with nasosinusal diseases or with a history of nasal surgery were excluded. RESULTS: Of the total of 103 participants, 16 (15.5%) reported olfactory complaints and 68 (66%) presented impairment in the olfactory test. It was observed that older individuals showed more changes in olfactory function (p = 0.001). Gender, education, lifestyle, comorbidities, medications in use and exposure to pollutants did not influence the impairment olfactory function of this population. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the elderly population evaluated. Most of these elderlies also present an inability to identify odours, not having awareness of this olfactory impairment.

36086905|t|Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in patients with multiple sclerosis.
36086905|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical outcomes of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been thoroughly investigated, but a further analysis on main signs and symptoms and their risk factors still needs attention. The objective of this study was to group together and describe based on similarity the most common signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in MS patients and identify all factors associated with their manifestation. METHOD: Logistic and linear regression models were run to recognize factors associated with each pooled group of symptoms and their total number. RESULTS: From March 2020 to November 2021, data were collected from 1354 MS patients with confirmed infection of COVID-19. Ageusia and anosmia was less frequent in older people (odds ratio [OR] 0.98; p = 0.005) and more in smoker patients (OR 1.39; p = 0.049). Smoke was also associated with an incremental number of symptoms (OR 1.24; p = 0.031), substance abuse (drugs or alcohol), conjunctivitis and rash (OR 5.20; p = 0.042) and the presence of at least one comorbidity with shortness of breath, tachycardia or chest pain (OR 1.24; p = 0.008). Some disease-modifying therapies were associated with greater frequencies of certain COVID-19 symptoms (association between anti-CD20 therapies and increment in the number of concomitant symptoms: OR 1.29; p = 0.05). Differences in frequencies between the three waves were found for flu-like symptoms (G1, p = 0.024), joint or muscle pain (G2, p = 0.013) and ageusia and anosmia (G5, p < 0.001). All cases should be referred to variants up to Delta. CONCLUSION: Several factors along with the choice of specific therapeutic approaches might have a different impact on the occurrence of some COVID-19 symptoms.

36169300|t|Sensory Loss and Risk of Dementia.
36169300|a|Sensory loss in olfaction, vision, and hearing is a risk factor for dementia, but the reasons for this are unclear. This review presents the neurobiological evidence linking each sensory modality to specific dementias and explores the potential mechanisms underlying this. Olfactory deficits can be linked to direct neuropathologic changes in the olfactory system due to Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, and may be a marker of disease severity. Visual deficits potentially increase dementia risk in a vulnerable individual by reducing resilience to dementia. Hearing deficits may indicate a susceptibility to Alzheimer disease through a variety of mechanisms. More generally, sensory impairment could be related to factors associated with resilience against dementia. Further research is needed to tease out the specific and synergistic effects of sensory impairment. Studying sensory loss in relation to neurodegenerative biomarkers is necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved. This could produce new monitoring and management strategies for people at risk of dementia.

36194902|t|Serial olfactory testing for the diagnosis of prodromal Parkinson's disease in the PARS study.
36194902|a|BACKGROUND: The Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome (PARS) study was designed to evaluate whether screening with olfactory testing and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging could identify participants at risk for developing Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: Hyposmia on a single test has been associated with increased risk of PD, but, taken alone, lacks specificity. We evaluated whether repeating olfactory testing improves the diagnostic characteristics of this screening approach. METHODS: Participants completed up to 10 years of clinical and imaging evaluations in the PARS cohort. Olfaction was assessed with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test at baseline and on average 1.4 years later. Multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to estimate the hazard of development of clinical PD or abnormal DAT imaging. RESULTS: Of 186 participants who were initially hyposmic, 28% reverted to normosmia on repeat testing (reverters). No initially normosmic subjects and only 2% of reverters developed DAT imaging progression or clinical PD, compared to 29% of subjects with persistent hyposmia who developed abnormal DAT and 20% who developed clinical PD. The relative risk of clinical conversion to PD was 8.3 (95% CI:0.92-75.2, p = 0.06) and of abnormal DAT scan was 12.5 (2.4-156.2, p = 0.005) for persistent hyposmia, compared to reversion. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent hyposmia on serial olfactory testing significantly increases the risk of developing clinical PD and abnormal DAT imaging, compared to hyposmia on a single test. Repeat olfactory testing may be an efficient and cost-effective strategy to improve identification of at-risk patients for early diagnosis and disease modification studies.

36208908|t|Smell deficits in COVID-19 and possible links with Parkinson's disease.
36208908|a|Olfactory impairment is a common symptom in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. While other viruses, such as influenza viruses, may affect the ability to smell, loss of olfactory function is often smoother and associated to various degrees of nasal symptoms. In COVID-19, smell loss may appear also in absence of other symptoms, frequently with a sudden onset. However, despite great clinical interest in COVID-19 olfactory alterations, very little is known concerning the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Moreover, olfactory dysfunction is observed in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease (PD) and can precede motor onset by many years, suggesting that viral infections, like COVID-19, and regional inflammatory responses may trigger defective protein aggregation and subsequent neurodegeneration, potentially linking COVID-19 olfactory impairment to neurodegeneration. In the following chapter, we report the neurobiological and neuropathological underpinnings of olfactory impairments encountered in COVID-19 and discuss the implications of these findings in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, with particular regard to PD and alpha-synuclein pathology.

36341691|t|Anosmia, mild cognitive impairment, and biomarkers of brain aging in older adults.
36341691|a|Olfactory impairment is a potential marker for prodromal dementia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This population-based study included 4214 dementia-free participants (age >=65 years). Olfaction was assessed using the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test. In the subsamples, we measured plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)40, Abeta42, total tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL; n = 1054); and quantified hippocampal, entorhinal cortex, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-signature cortical thickness (n = 917). Data were analyzed with logistic and linear regression models. In the total sample, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed in 1102 persons (26.2%; amnestic MCI, n = 931; non-amnestic MCI, n = 171). Olfactory impairment was significantly associated with increased likelihoods of MCI, amnestic MCI, and non-amnestic MCI. In the subsamples, anosmia was significantly associated with higher plasma total tau and NfL concentrations, smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes, and greater WMH volume, and marginally with lower AD-signature cortical thickness. These results suggest that cerebral neurodegenerative and microvascular lesions are common neuropathologies linking anosmia with MCI in older adults.

36342675|t|Widening the Spectrum of Risk Factors, Comorbidities, and Prodromal Features of Parkinson Disease.
36342675|a|Importance: The prodromal phase of Parkinson disease (PD) may last for more than 10 years. Recognition of the spectrum and occurrence of risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal features of PD can increase understanding of the causes and development of the disease and help identify individuals at risk. Objective: To identify the association of a subsequent diagnosis of PD with a range of risk factors and prodromal features, including lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and potential extracerebral manifestations of PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a case-control study using insurance claims of outpatient consultations of patients with German statutory health insurance between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020. Included were patients with incident diagnosis of PD without a previous diagnosis of parkinsonism or dementia and controls matched 1:2 for age, sex, region, and earliest year of outpatient encounter. Exposures: Exposures were selected based on previous systematic reviews, case-control and cohort studies reporting on risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal features of PD. Main Outcomes and Measures: Previously postulated risk factors and prodromal features of PD, using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding. Results: A total of 138 345 patients with incident PD (mean [SD] age, 75.1 [9.8] years; 73 720 male [53.3%]) and 276 690 matched controls (mean [SD] age, 75.1 (9.8) years; 147 440 male [53.3%]) were identified. Study participants were followed up for a mean (SD) of 6.0 (2.0) years. Consistent with previous reports, risk factors and prodromal features associated with PD included traumatic brain injury, odds ratio (OR), 1.62; 95% CI, 1.36-1.92; alcohol misuse, OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.44; hypertension, OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.26-1.31; anosmia, OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.59-2.93; and parasomnias (including RBD), OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84. In addition, there were associations with restless legs syndrome (OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 3.91-4.50), sleep apnea (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37-1.54), epilepsy (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 2.07-2.46), migraine (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.29), bipolar disorder (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 3.11-4.67), and schizophrenia (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 3.82-5.25). The following diagnoses were also found to be associated with PD: sensory impairments beyond anosmia, such as hearing loss (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20) and changes of skin sensation (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.43). There were also positive associations with skin disorders (eg, seborrheic dermatitis, OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15-1.46; psoriasis, OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21), gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25-1.33; gastritis, OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.33), conditions with a potential inflammatory component (eg, seronegative osteoarthritis, OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43), and diabetes types 1 (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.43) and 2 (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.27). Associations even 5 to 10 years before diagnosis included tremor (odds ratio [OR], 4.49; 95% CI, 3.98-5.06), restless legs syndrome (OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 3.39-4.09), bipolar disorder (OR, 3.80; 95% CI, 2.82-5.14), and schizophrenia (OR, 4.00; 95% CI, 3.31-4.85). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this case-control study suggest that the associations found between PD and certain risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal symptoms in a representative population may reflect possible early extrastriatal and extracerebral pathology of PD. This may be due to shared genetic risk with PD, medication exposure, or direct causation, or represent pathophysiologically relevant factors contributing to the pathogenesis of PD.

36611276|t|Transitions between Mild Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Mortality: The Importance of Olfaction.
36611276|a|BACKGROUND: Existing literature suggests that impaired olfaction may be an early marker for cognitive decline. Tracking the earliest stages of the progression to dementia is paramount, and yet the importance of olfactory ability throughout cognitive states and death remains unclear. METHODS: Drawing data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (N=1501; 74% female), olfactory ability was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (range=0-16), while cognitive states (unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia) were determined using a three-step neuropsychological diagnostic protocol at up to 15 annual occasions. Multi-state survival models simultaneously estimated the association of olfactory ability on transitions through cognitive states and death, while multinomial regression models estimated cognitively unimpaired and total life expectancies. RESULTS: Higher olfactory scores were associated with a reduced risk of transitioning from unimpaired cognition to MCI (HR=0.86, 95%CI 0.82-0.88) and from MCI to dementia (HR=0.89, 0.86-0.93), indicating that one-unit increase in olfactory scores were associated with an approximate 14% and 11% reduction in risk, respectively. Additionally, higher olfactory scores were associated with a greater likelihood of transitioning backward from MCI to unimpaired cognition (HR=1.07, 1.02-1.12). Furthermore, higher baseline olfactory scores were associated with more years of longevity without cognitive impairment. However, olfaction was not associated with the transition to death when accounting for transitions through cognitive states. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that higher olfactory identification scores are associated with a decreased risk of transitioning to impaired cognitive states and that associations between olfaction and mortality may occur primarily through the pathway of neurodegeneration.

36689643|t|Markers of olfactory dysfunction and progression to dementia: A 12-year population-based study.
36689643|a|INTRODUCTION: We evaluated markers of olfactory dysfunction (OD) for estimating hazard of dementia in older adults. METHODS: Mild (hyposmia) and severe (anosmia) OD was classified in a population-based study of dementia-free persons (SNAC-K; n = 2473; mean age = 70 years) using the Sniffin sticks odor identification task. Combined variables were created for objective and subjective OD and for OD and APOE status. Hazard of dementia across 12 years was estimated with Cox regression. RESULTS: OD was associated with increased hazard of dementia (2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60-2.52), with the strongest association for anosmia (2.92; 95% CI 2.14-3.98). Results remained consistent after adjusting for potential confounders and across age and sex subgroups. APOE epsilon4 carriers with anosmia had the highest hazard of dementia (epsilon4: 6.95; 95% CI 4.16-11.62; epsilon4/epsilon4: 19.84; 95% CI 6.17-63.78). DISCUSSION: OD is associated with increased risk of dementia, especially severe impairment in combination with genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease.

36768440|t|Neurons, Nose, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Olfactory Function and Cognitive Impairment.
36768440|a|Olfactory capacity declines with aging, but increasing evidence shows that smell dysfunction is one of the early signs of prodromal neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The study of olfactory ability and its role in neurodegenerative diseases arouses much interest in the scientific community. In neurology, olfactory impairment is a potential early marker for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The loss of smell is considered a clinical sign of early-stage disease and a marker of the disease's progression and cognitive impairment. Highlighting the importance of biological bases of smell and molecular pathways could be fundamental to improve neuroprotective and therapeutic strategies. We focused on the review articles and meta-analyses on olfactory and cognitive impairment. We depicted the neurobiology of olfaction and the most common olfactory tests in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we underlined the close relationship between the olfactory and cognitive deficit due to nasal neuroepithelium, which is a direct extension of the CNS in communication with the external environment. Neurons, Nose, and Neurodegenerative diseases highlights the role of olfactory dysfunction as a clinical marker for early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when it is associated with molecular, clinical, and neuropathological correlations.

36934313|t|Gustatory dysfunction is related to Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
36934313|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction has been reported to be involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. However, gustatory dysfunction in PD has not been evaluated as in-depth as olfactory dysfunction. We reviewed the previously published studies regarding gustatory function in PD patients and suggested the possibility that gustatory dysfunction may also be associated with PD. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed databases were searched for studies evaluating gustatory function in PD patients. We used the standardized mean difference and a 95% confidence interval (CI) as the effect analysis index regarding the taste strip test. The relative risk and 95% CI were used as the effect analysis index for the questionnaires and propylthiouracil (PTU)/phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) perception test. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using forest plots, Cochran's Q, and the I2 statistic; heterogeneity was considered high when I2 was over 75%. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and the Egger bias test. RESULTS: We identified 19 articles that reported the results of gustatory function tests in PD patients and healthy controls. Most of these studies used various gustatory tests, including taste strips, questionnaires, taste solutions, PTU/PTC perception tests, and electrogustometry, and reported significantly lower gustatory function in PD patients than in the controls. However, several articles reported contradictory results. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these studies, gustatory dysfunction is closely related to PD. However, the number of studies and enrolled subjects was small, and a unified gustatory function test was lacking. Therefore, further studies with larger populations and normalized gustatory function tests are needed.

37059509|t|Assessment of heterogeneity among participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort using alpha-synuclein seed amplification: a cross-sectional study.
37059509|a|BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) have the potential to differentiate people with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls. We used the well characterised, multicentre Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort to further assess the diagnostic performance of the alpha-synuclein SAA and to examine whether the assay identifies heterogeneity among patients and enables the early identification of at-risk groups. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at enrolment for PPMI participants (including people with sporadic Parkinson's disease from LRRK2 and GBA variants, healthy controls, prodromal individuals with either rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) or hyposmia, and non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA variants) from 33 participating academic neurology outpatient practices worldwide (in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK, and the USA). alpha-synuclein SAA analysis of CSF was performed using previously described methods. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in participants with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, including subgroups based on genetic and clinical features. We established the frequency of positive alpha-synuclein SAA results in prodromal participants (RBD and hyposmia) and non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease, and compared alpha-synuclein SAA to clinical measures and other biomarkers. We used odds ratio estimates with 95% CIs to measure the association between alpha-synuclein SAA status and categorical measures, and two-sample 95% CIs from the resampling method to assess differences in medians between alpha-synuclein SAA positive and negative participants for continuous measures. A linear regression model was used to control for potential confounders such as age and sex. FINDINGS: This analysis included 1123 participants who were enrolled between July 7, 2010, and July 4, 2019. Of these, 545 had Parkinson's disease, 163 were healthy controls, 54 were participants with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit, 51 were prodromal participants, and 310 were non-manifesting carriers. Sensitivity for Parkinson's disease was 87 7% (95% CI 84 9-90 5), and specificity for healthy controls was 96 3% (93 4-99 2). The sensitivity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in sporadic Parkinson's disease with the typical olfactory deficit was 98 6% (96 4-99 4). The proportion of positive alpha-synuclein SAA was lower than this figure in subgroups including LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (67 5% [59 2-75 8]) and participants with sporadic Parkinson's disease without olfactory deficit (78 3% [69 8-86 7]). Participants with LRRK2 variant and normal olfaction had an even lower alpha-synuclein SAA positivity rate (34 7% [21 4-48 0]). Among prodromal and at-risk groups, 44 (86%) of 51 of participants with RBD or hyposmia had positive alpha-synuclein SAA (16 of 18 with hyposmia, and 28 of 33 with RBD). 25 (8%) of 310 non-manifesting carriers (14 of 159 [9%] LRRK2 and 11 of 151 [7%] GBA) were positive. INTERPRETATION: This study represents the largest analysis so far of the alpha-synuclein SAA for the biochemical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that the assay classifies people with Parkinson's disease with high sensitivity and specificity, provides information about molecular heterogeneity, and detects prodromal individuals before diagnosis. These findings suggest a crucial role for the alpha-synuclein SAA in therapeutic development, both to identify pathologically defined subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and to establish biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts.

37611509|t|Polygenic risk score for Parkinson's disease and olfaction among middle-aged to older women.
37611509|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory impairment and Parkinson's disease (PD) may share common genetic and environmental risk factors. This study investigates the association of a PD polygenic risk score (PRS) with olfaction, and whether the associations are modified by environmental exposures of PM2.5, NO2, or smoking. METHODS: This analysis included 3358 women (aged 50-80) from the Sister Study with genetic data and results from the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) administered in 2018-2019. PD PRS was calculated using 90 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Olfactory impairment was defined with different B-SIT cutoffs, and PD diagnosis was adjudicated via expert review. We report odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: As expected, PD PRS was strongly associated with the odds of having PD (OR highest vs. lowest quartile = 3.79 (1.64, 8.73)). The highest PRS quartile was also associated with olfactory impairment, with OR ranging from 1.24 (0.98, 1.56) for a B-SIT cutoff of 9 to 1.42 (1.04, 1.92) for a cutoff of 6. For individual B-SIT items, the highest PRS quartile was generally associated with lower odds of correctly identifying the odorant, albeit only statistically significant for pineapple (0.72 (0.56, 0.94), soap (0.76 (0.58, 0.99)) and rose (0.70 (0.54, 0.92)). The association of PD PRS with olfactory impairment was not modified by airborne environmental exposures or smoking. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that high PD genetic susceptibility is associated with olfactory impairment in middle-aged and older women.

37619327|t|Hyposmia and apathy in early, de novo Parkinson's disease: Lessons from structural brain connectivity.
37619327|a|INTRODUCTION: The neuroanatomical structures implicated in olfactory and emotional processing overlap significantly. Our understanding of the relationship between hyposmia and apathy, common manifestations of early Parkinson's disease (PD), is inadequate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 40 patients with early de-novo idiopathic PD enrolled within 2 years of motor symptom onset in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study. To be included in the analysis, patients must have smell dysfunction but no apathy at the baseline visit and had completed a diffusion MRI (dMRI) at the baseline visit and at the 48-month follow-up visit. We used the FMRIB Software Library's diffusion tool kit to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) in six regions of interest on dMRI: bilateral anterior corona radiata, left cingulum, left superior corona radiata, genu and body of the corpus callosum. We compared the FA in each region from the dMRI done at the beginning of the study with the follow up studies at 4 years. RESULTS: We found a significant decrease of FA at the bilateral anterior corona radiata, and the genu and body of the corpus callosum comparing baseline scans with follow up images at 4-years after starting the study. CONCLUSION: Structural connectivity changes associated with apathy can be seen early in PD patients with smell dysfunction.

37725455|t|Smell and Taste Disorders in Primary Care.
37725455|a|Disorders of smell and taste are reported by approximately one-fifth of people 40 years and older, and one-third of people 80 years and older. These disorders affect quality of life and the ability to identify smoke and toxins. Smell and taste disorders can be early signs of dementia or Parkinson disease and are associated with increased mortality. Dysfunction may be apparent or may develop insidiously. Screening questionnaires are available, but many patients are unaware of their disorder. Most smell and taste disorders are due to sinonasal disease but also could be caused by smoking, medications, head trauma, neurodegenerative disease, alcohol dependence, or less common conditions. The differential diagnosis should guide the evaluation and include anterior rhinoscopy and an examination of the oral cavity, head, and cranial nerves. Further investigation is often unnecessary, but nasal endoscopy and computed tomography of the sinuses may be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head with contrast should be performed if there is an abnormal neurologic examination finding or if trauma or a tumor is suspected. Olfactory testing is indicated in refractory cases or for patients with poor quality of life and disease associated with smell or taste dysfunction. Smell and taste disorders may resolve when reversible causes are treated, but improvement is less likely when they are due to trauma, age, or neurodegenerative disease. Olfactory training is a self-administered mindful exposure therapy that may improve olfactory function. Physicians should encourage patients to ensure that smoke and other alarms are operational and to adhere to food expiration dates.

38098019|t|Human-derived air-liquid interface cultures decipher Alzheimer's disease-SARS-CoV-2 crosstalk in the olfactory mucosa.
38098019|a|BACKGROUND: The neurological effects of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) raise concerns about potential long-term consequences, such as an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation and other AD-associated pathologies are also suggested to increase the risk of serious SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anosmia is a common neurological symptom reported in COVID-19 and in early AD. The olfactory mucosa (OM) is important for the perception of smell and a proposed site of viral entry to the brain. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 infection at the OM of individuals with AD. METHODS: To address this gap, we established a 3D in vitro model of the OM from primary cells derived from cognitively healthy and AD individuals. We cultured the cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to study SARS-CoV-2 infection under controlled experimental conditions. Primary OM cells in ALI expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and several other known SARS-CoV-2 receptor and were highly vulnerable to infection. Infection was determined by secreted viral RNA content and confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) in the infected cells by immunocytochemistry. Differential responses of healthy and AD individuals-derived OM cells to SARS-CoV-2 were determined by RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Results indicate that cells derived from cognitively healthy donors and individuals with AD do not differ in susceptibility to infection with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, transcriptomic signatures in cells from individuals with AD are highly distinct. Specifically, the cells from AD patients that were infected with the virus showed increased levels of oxidative stress, desensitized inflammation and immune responses, and alterations to genes associated with olfaction. These results imply that individuals with AD may be at a greater risk of experiencing severe outcomes from the infection, potentially driven by pre-existing neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The study sheds light on the interplay between AD pathology and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altered transcriptomic signatures in AD cells may contribute to unique symptoms and a more severe disease course, with a notable involvement of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to enhance outcomes for AD patients with viral infection. The study is crucial to better comprehend the relationship between AD, COVID-19, and anosmia. It highlights the importance of ongoing research to develop more effective treatments for those at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

38366763|t|Pathological features and molecular signatures of early olfactory dysfunction in 3xTg-AD model mice.
38366763|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is known to be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism, particularly the specific molecular events that occur during the early stages of olfactory disorders, remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, we utilized transcriptomic sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and biochemical detection to investigate the specific pathological and molecular characteristics of the olfactory bulb (OB) in 4-month-old male triple transgenic 3xTg-AD mice (PS1M146V/APPSwe/TauP301L). RESULTS: Initially, during the early stages of olfactory impairment, no significant learning and memory deficits were observed. Correspondingly, we observed significant accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Tau pathology specifically in the OB, but not in the hippocampus. In addition, significant axonal morphological defects were detected in the olfactory bulb, cortex, and hippocampal brain regions of 3xTg-AD mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of neuroinflammation-related genes, accompanied by a significant decrease in neuronal activity-related genes in the OB. Moreover, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting demonstrated an activation of glial cell biomarkers Iba1 and GFAP, along with a reduction in the expression levels of neuronal activity-related molecules Nr4a2 and FosB, as well as olfaction-related marker OMP. CONCLUSION: In sum, the early accumulation of Abeta and Tau pathology induces neuroinflammation, which subsequently leads to a decrease in neuronal activity within the OB, causing axonal transport deficits that contribute to olfactory disorders. Nr4a2 and FosB appear to be promising targets for intervention aimed at improving early olfactory impairment in AD.

38430690|t|Longitudinal brain changes in Parkinson's disease with severe olfactory deficit.
38430690|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are associated with distinct cognitive trajectories in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying neurobiology for this relationship remains unclear but may involve distinct patterns of neurodegeneration. This study aimed to examine longitudinal cortical atrophy and thinning in early-stage PD with severe olfactory deficit (anosmia) without and with concurrent probable RBD. METHODS: Longitudinal MRI data over four years of 134 de novo PD and 49 healthy controls (HC) from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) cohort were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Patients were categorized into those with anosmia by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score <= 18 (AO+) and those without (UPSIT score > 18, AO-). The AO+ group was further subdivided into AO+ with probable RBD (AO+RBD+) and without (AO+RBD-) for subanalysis. RESULTS: Compared to subjects without baseline anosmia, the AO+ group exhibited greater longitudinal declines in both volume and thickness in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri and right transverse temporal gyrus. Patients with concurrent anosmia and RBD showed more extensive longitudinal declines in cortical volume and thickness, involving additional brain regions including the bilateral precuneus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right paracentral gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: The atrophy/thinning patterns in early-stage PD with severe olfactory dysfunction include regions that are critical for cognitive function and could provide a structural basis for previously reported associations between severe olfactory deficit and cognitive decline in PD. Concurrent RBD might enhance the dynamics of cortical changes.

38493734|t|Taste and smell function in Wilson's disease.
38493734|a|OBJECTIVE: Wilson's disease (WD) is a metabolic disorder associated with abnormal copper metabolism that results in hepatic, psychiatric, and neurologic symptoms. No investigation of taste function has been made in patients with WD, although olfactory dysfunction has been evaluated. METHODS: Quantitative taste and smell test scores of 29 WD patients were compared to those of 790 healthy controls. Taste was measured using the 53-item Waterless Empirical Taste Test (WETT ) and smell using the 40-item revised University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (R-UPSIT ). Multiple linear regression analysis controlled for age and sex. RESULTS: Average WETT  scores did not differ meaningfully between WD and control subjects (respective medians & IQRs = 32 [28-42] & 34 [27-41]); linear regression coefficient = 1.19, 95% CI [-0.81, 3.19], p = 0.242). In contrast, WD was associated with significantly reduced olfactory function [respective median (IQR) R-UPSIT  scores = 35 (33-37) vs. 37 (35-38); adjusted linear regression coefficient = -1.59, 95% CI [-2.34, -0.833]; p < 0.001)]. Neither olfaction nor taste were influenced by WD symptom subtype [23 (79.3%) were hepatic-predominant; 6 (20.7%) neurologic predominant]; R-UPSIT , p = 0.774; WETT , p = 0.912). No effects of primary medication or years since diagnosis (R-UPSIT , p = 0.147; WETT , p = 0.935) were found. Weak correlations were present between R-UPSIT  and WETT  scores for both control (r=0.187, p < 0.0001) and WD (r=0.237) subjects, although the latter correlation did not reach the 0.05 alpha level (p = 0.084). CONCLUSION: Although WD negatively impacts smell function, taste is spared. Research is needed to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for this divergence.

38607054|t|The Olfactory Trail of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38607054|a|Alterations in olfactory functions are proposed as possible early biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases manifest olfactory dysfunction as a symptom, which is worth mentioning. The alterations do not occur in all patients, but they can serve to rule out neurodegenerative pathologies that are not associated with small deficits. Several prevalent neurodegenerative conditions, including impaired smell, arise in the early stages of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, presenting an attractive prospect as a snitch for early diagnosis. This review covers the current knowledge on the link between olfactory deficits and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The review also covers the emergence of olfactory receptors as actors in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Olfactory receptors are not exclusively expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. Olfactory receptors are widespread in the human body; they are expressed, among others, in the testicles, lungs, intestines, kidneys, skin, heart, and blood cells. Although information on these ectopically expressed olfactory receptors is limited, they appear to be involved in cell recognition, migration, proliferation, wound healing, apoptosis, and exocytosis. Regarding expression in non-chemosensory regions of the central nervous system (CNS), future research should address the role, in both the glia and neurons, of olfactory receptors. Here, we review the limited but relevant information on the altered expression of olfactory receptor genes in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. By unraveling how olfactory receptor activation is involved in neurodegeneration and identifying links between olfactory structures and neuronal death, valuable information could be gained for early diagnosis and intervention strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.

38728185|t|Olfactory Dysfunction and Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.
38728185|a| Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, and it is one of the leading causes of death globally. Identification and validation of biomarkers that herald the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease is of paramount importance for early reliable diagnosis and effective pharmacological therapy commencement. A substantial body of evidence has emerged demonstrating that olfactory dysfunction is a preclinical symptom of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. While a correlation between olfactory dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease onset and progression in humans exists, the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unknown. The aim of this article is to review the current state of knowledge regarding the range of potential factors that may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease-related olfactory dysfunction. This review predominantly focuses on genetic mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease including amyloid-beta protein precursor, presenilin 1 and 2, and apolipoprotein E mutations, that may (in varying ways) drive the cellular events that lead to and sustain olfactory dysfunction.

39127444|t|The Current Status and Challenges of Olfactory Dysfunction Study in Alzheimer's Disease.
39127444|a|Olfactory functioning involves multiple cognitive processes and the coordinated actions of various neural systems. Any disruption at any stage of this process may result in olfactory dysfunction, which is consequently widely used to predict the onset and progression of diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully unraveled, apparent changes were observed in olfactory brain areas form patients who suffer from AD by means of medical imaging and electroencephalography (EEG). Olfactory dysfunction holds significant promise in detecting AD during the preclinical stage preceding mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Owing to the strong specificity, olfactory tests are prevalently applied for screening in community cohorts. And combining olfactory tests with other biomarkers may further establish an optimal model for AD prediction in studies of specific olfactory dysfunctions and improve the sensitivity and specificity of early AD diagnosis.

3316502|t|Olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
3316502|a|Altered olfactory function may be important clinically and theoretically in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initial evidence of poor olfactory recognition performance in AD was followed by other reports of hyposmia in this disorder. Although two of these studies have found significantly better performance in other demented groups, the utility of olfactory testing in the differential diagnostic workup of dementia may have limitations. Neuroanatomical and neurochemical studies relevant to AD and olfaction are reviewed. Finally, the effects of aging on olfactory performance is discussed. It is concluded that these effects cannot be adequately assessed without rigorous control for cognitive status in sampled cohorts.

8424850|t|Perception of taste and smell in elderly persons.
8424850|a|By the turn of the century, there will be considerable shifts in demographics, including a massive increase in our aging population. As we plan for better nutrition in the twenty-first century, the special sensory and nutritional needs of the elderly must be taken into account. Chemosensory losses, specifically decrements in the senses of taste and smell, can lead to inadequate intake, especially in the elderly sick. These losses result not only from anatomic changes that occur during normal aging but also from certain diseases, pharmacological and surgical interventions, radiation, and environmental pollutants. The design of foods for the elderly that could both compensate for these chemosensory losses and meet nutritional needs presents new challenges and opportunities for the food industry.

8424852|t|Nutrition and chemosensory perception in the elderly.
8424852|a|The elderly person's perception of foods and food flavor is affected by age-associated changes in the chemical senses (taste, smell, and trigeminal sensation). Both classic and modern psychophysical techniques have been applied to achieve some understanding of these changes. Taste threshold sensitivity declines with age; however, the magnitude of the decline and the degree to which taste qualities are differentially affected remains to be understood. Suprathreshold taste intensity perception is affected by age, but there is a differential effect of taste quality. Experiments with blended foods have indicated that both olfactory and taste deficits contribute to older people's difficulty with food identification. Experiments assessing threshold sensitivity, suprathreshold intensity, and suprathreshold identification have all demonstrated significant impairment in olfaction in old age. In fact, these effects are far greater than in the taste system. Patients with Alzheimer's disease show even greater olfactory deficits than normal elderly and the effect is related to the degree of dementia. We have ruled out nasal disease in these patients as the primary causes of olfactory insensitivity, because significant impairment remains when the influence of nasal airflow and nasal cytology has been removed statistically. Both normal elderly and patients with Alzheimer's disease show impairment in odor memory. Sensitivity to, familiarity with, and identifiability of the odors all play a role in odor memory performance. Flavor preference also changes over the lifespan. Older subjects, for instance, rate high concentration of sugar and salt as pleasanter than young subjects do. Multiple influences contribute to this phenomenon. Elderly persons and those of lower nutritional status have shown preferences for higher concentrations of casein hydrolysate than young persons and those of higher nutritional status, suggesting that dietary preference can be related to chemosensory cues. There are significant age-associated changes in chemosensory perception that have the potential to interact with dietary selection and nutrition in the elderly. A better understanding of these phenomena may promote health and well-being in the elderly.

10627864|t|Is Parkinson's disease a primary olfactory disorder?
10627864|a|It has been known for over 30 years that olfactory function is disordered in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The severity and partial specificity of anosmia was not realized until recently, with the advent of more detailed analysis and sophisticated measurement. The olfactory vector hypothesis suggests that the causative agent for IPD enters the brain via the nasal route, but the reason for olfactory dysfunction may be more subtle. Evidence for olfactory disturbance is reviewed from pathological, psychological, neurophysiological and genetic stand-points. It is proposed that the initial causative event in IPD may start in the rhinencephalon (olfactory brain) prior to damage in the basal ganglia.

15177056|t|Mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative disorders.
15177056|a|Although olfaction is the primal sense in animals, its importance in humans is underappreciated. Extensive literature demonstrates that aging is accompanied by olfactory loss and hyposmia/anosmia which is also a feature of several neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are characterized by severe olfactory deficits, while problems of olfactory discrimination are less prominent features in several other disorders. Olfactory loss is accompanied by structural abnormalities of the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb and the central olfactory cortices. This review summarizes our present knowledge about the pathological changes in the olfactory system during aging and in various neurodegenerative diseases.

16928347|t|Olfactory dysfunction as a predictor of neurodegenerative disease.
16928347|a|Olfactory dysfunction is present in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or idiopathic Parkinson's disease and can differentiate each of these disorders from related disorders with similar clinical presentations. The pathologic hallmarks of each disease are present in brain regions involved in processing olfactory input. Both the olfactory functional deficits and the corroborating pathologic lesions are present in asymptomatic subjects with increased risk of developing these diseases. Preclinical detection of neurodegenerative diseases is necessary to control their devastating effects on individuals and societies. We address whether olfactory dysfunction can be used to assess risk for developing Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease in asymptomatic individuals. We argue that further characterization and a deeper understanding of olfactory deficits in these neurodegenerative diseases at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels will augment our acumen for preclinical detection and elucidate pathogenic mechanisms to guide the development of new therapeutic modalities.

17110318|t|To smell the immune system: olfaction, autoimmunity and brain involvement.
17110318|a|Aside from its recognition and warning functions, olfaction serves many purposes in the CNS and remains one of the most important means of communication with the environment. In addition to olfactory tract input, the olfactory bulb also receives and provides input to other brain centers that modify neuronal activity. Research in the field of immunology as well as in various brain illnesses is beginning to indicate the increasing relevance of smell in pathophysiology. Much of this is based on the many intricate interactions that exist between the immune system and the nervous system, and evidence exists that there may be something unique about the olfactory system that is inextricably related to immunological function. In addition, accumulating evidence confirms the existence of olfactory dysfunction in brain disease, much of which appears at early stages including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia and depression. Such observations may further suggest that under certain circumstances, olfactory abnormalities may be associated with autoimmune conditions. Since the organization of the olfactory system is so sensitive, impairment may be noted at an early stage. This may become important in the prediction of certain brain illnesses. While preliminary evidence may suggest a role for olfaction in the management and alleviation of various disorders, investigation of its clinical relevance remains limited.

17351535|t|[Olfaction and neurological diseases: a review of the literature].
17351535|a|Olfactory disorders are often misjudged and rarely rated in the clinical setting. They are nevertheless described in a wide range of neurological disorders, and their evaluation can be useful for diagnosis. Usually irreversible olfactory dysfunction is a well-known complication after head trauma. Severe changes in olfactory tests are observed in Parkinson's disease. Dysfunction is present at disease onset and evidenced with all behavioral tests. Regarding other parkinsonian syndromes, olfactory performances are severely impaired in Lewy body disease, less pronounced in multiple system atrophy and usually preserved in corticobasal degeneration. Olfactory deficits are an early feature in Alzheimer's disease and worsen with disease progression. Rarely reported by patients, they must be searched for with olfactory tests. Though epilepsy is mainly known for its olfactory hallucinatory disorders, alterations of olfactory abilities are also described, especially in mesial temporal epilepsy. Disorders of olfactory perception are finally reported in patients with multiple sclerosis and migraine. After a reminder of anatomical data on the olfactory system, and the different methods of testing used to rate olfactory performances, the current review focuses on the type of olfactory dysfunction and damaged brain areas of the olfactory system encountered in the main neurological diseases.

18232016|t|The olfactory vector hypothesis of neurodegenerative disease: is it viable?
18232016|a|Environmental agents, including viruses, prions, and toxins, have been implicated in the cause of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The presence of smell loss and the pathological involvement of the olfactory pathways in the formative stages of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, together with evidence that xenobiotics, some epidemiologically linked to these diseases, can readily enter the brain via the olfactory mucosa, have led to the hypothesis that Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may be caused or catalyzed by agents that enter the brain via this route. Evidence for and against this concept, the "olfactory vector hypothesis," is addressed in this review.

20945979|t|Olfaction as a biomarker in Parkinson's disease.
20945979|a|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is common and of interest, both as a clinical finding and potential biomarker. In this article, we discuss studies characterizing the olfactory deficit in Parkinson's disease and pathological analysis that suggests the olfactory system is a likely induction site of the neurodegenerative process. These studies have enabled research to explore the potential of olfactory dysfunction as a key component in early diagnostic strategies, as a biomarker for diagnostic purposes, a predictor of clinical outcomes and a potential therapy-independent marker of disease progression.

21244723|t|Olfactory and gustatory function in patients with multiple sclerosis.
21244723|a|BACKGROUND: The olfactory function (OF) and gustatory function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) can be limited. METHODS: We performed the testing of orthonasal (Threshold Discrimination Identification [TDI] score with Sniffin' Sticks) and retronasal (Taste Powder) OF and gustatory function (Taste Strips; Burghart, Wedel, Germany) in patients diagnosed with MS and healthy controls matching in age, sex, and smoking habits. RESULTS: Eight of 16 MS patients (50%) displayed hyposmia (TDI score, 28.75 +- 1.28; p = 0.06); the identification subtest significantly was restricted (12.63 +- 1.67; p = 0.001). Four of 16 MS patients (25%) had limited retronasal OF with a Taste Powder score of 4.5 +- 1.29. The gustatory function in 19% of MS patients was significantly limited (Taste Strip score, 5.33 +- 2.52; p = 0.02). Patients who estimated their ability to smell as diminished performed more poorly on retronasal OF testing (r =0.657; p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: This study confirms the incidence of olfactory disorder in MS patients that has been reported in the literature. Interestingly, a significant correlation between orthonasal and retronasal OF testing was not shown. A higher incidence of gustatory dysfunction was shown and might serve as another potential marker for this disease.

22020420|t|Olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis: association with secondary progression.
22020420|a|OBJECTIVE: The Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) was used to explore odour identification capacities in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: In total, 153 consecutive patients with MS and 165 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All participants were asked to answer the B-SIT and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Scale (MSSS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used for patients' clinical and cognitive characterization. RESULTS: Patients with MS (11.1%) were more impaired on the B-SIT than HC participants (3%). The frequency of impairment was higher for patients with secondary progressive (SPMS; 11/16, 68.8%) than relapsing-remitting (RRMS; 4/121, 3.3%) or primary progressive (2/16, 12.5%) courses. A threshold score of <= 8 on the B-SIT provided a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 97% in the identification of SPMS among patients with relapsing onset. The association between SPMS and impaired B-SIT remained statistically significant after adjusting for demographic (i.e. age and education), clinical (i.e. disease duration, EDSS, and MSSS), psychopathological (i.e. HADS anxiety and depression scores), and cognitive (i.e. MMSE) variables. CONCLUSIONS: A brief odour identification measure provided a good discrimination between SPMS and RRMS courses. A systematic assessment of olfactory functions may contribute to the development of clinical markers of SPMS.

22094386|t|Olfactory deficits induce neurofilament hyperphosphorylation.
22094386|a|Olfactory dysfunction, including structural abnormalities of the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb and the central olfactory cortices is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in aged population characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). How olfactory deficits are linked with AD-like neuropathological changes is still unknown. Here, by using two anosmia animal models, bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) rats and Cnga2(-/Y) mice, which lack intact olfactory CNG channels, we found the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated neurofilament (NF) are highly increased in the neurites at both the hippocampus and the cortex. As hyperphosphorylated NF is one of the main components of NFTs, our study strongly suggested the underlying correlation of olfactory deficits with AD-like pathological impairments.

22314778|t|Olfactory dysfunction and parasympathetic dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease.
22314778|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory impairment occurs early in Parkinson's disease (PD), as may dysautonomia. We investigated the relationship between olfaction and dysautonomia as well as other non-motor manifestations of PD. METHODS: Olfaction [University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT)], autonomic function in the pupillary (constriction and redilation velocity) and cardiac systems (resting low- and high-frequency heart rate variability (LF and HF HRV), positional changes in systolic blood pressure), neuropsychiatric function [Mini-mental Status Exam (MMSE)], Hamilton Depression Scale, activities of daily living [(ADLs), Schwab and England ADLs scale], quality of life [Short Form-36 health survey, PD Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39)], and other non-motor symptoms [Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS)] were simultaneously assessed in 33 participants (15 PD, 18 controls). Group comparisons, Spearman's coefficients and non-parametric rank-based regression were employed to characterize relationships between olfaction and non-motor features. RESULTS: Smell scores were lower in the PD group and correlated positively with pupil constriction velocity and HF HRV. Smell scores were correlated negatively with PDQ-39 and gastrointestinal items of the NMSS and positively with MMSE and Schwab and England ADLs. These correlated measures were not significant terms in regression models of smell scores in which age and PD diagnosis were significant and accounted for over half of the variability (R-squared 0.52-0.58). INTERPRETATION: This study suggests olfactory involvement occurs with parasympathetic dysautonomia in the pupillary and cardiovascular systems, involving both age-related and PD-related processes. Other non-motor features are concurrently involved, supporting the notion that aging and PD have widespread effects involving discrete portions of the autonomic and olfactory systems.

22414849|t|The effect of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease on olfaction: a meta-analysis.
22414849|a|Impaired sense of smell is one of the earliest clinical features in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A meta-analysis was performed on articles obtained from the PubMed database in order to determine what aspects of olfaction are affected in these two diseases. By applying strict criteria, we included a total of 81 studies meeting the following criteria: (1) patients had a clinical diagnosis of AD or PD; (2) patients were compared to a healthy control group; (3) patients and controls were age-matched; (4) olfactory function was assessed by means of a psychophysical olfactory test; (5) mean and standard deviation were reported. Results indicate that AD and PD patients are more impaired on odor identification and recognition tasks than on odor detection thresholds task. In addition, PD patients are more impaired on detection thresholds than AD patients. These results suggest that PD patients are more impaired on low-level perceptual olfactory tasks whereas AD patients are more strongly impaired on higher-order olfactory tasks involving specific cognitive processes. The effect appears more pronounced for AD than PD, which seem to be affected more homogeneously. In conclusion, olfactory identification and recognition appear as the most interesting candidates to be included in a battery to detect subclinical cases in AD. In parallel, detection thresholds should be included in such a battery for subclinical PD patients.

22752694|t|Prevalence and phenomenology of olfactory hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.
22752694|a|BACKGROUND: Although visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been described in several major studies, little is known about olfactory hallucinations (OHs). METHODS: The authors performed a detailed analysis of OHs in a cohort of 87 Parkinsonian patients to estimate the prevalence of OHs and describe their phenomenology. They also evaluated smelling abilities in terms of detection and identification. Assessment of both, OHs and olfactory function, was also performed using a control group of 40 normal subjects. RESULTS: Nine patients exhibited OHs compared with none of the controls, giving a prevalence of 10% for OHs in patients. OHs were described as rare, short-lasting, unpleasant odours which are not frightening since clearly identified by the patient as hallucinations. Parkinsonian patients with OHs exhibited olfactory impairment of detection and identification compared with controls, but there was no difference in their olfactory abilities from Parkinsonian patients without OHs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, OHs should be added to the list of non-motor PD symptoms that can occur early or late in the course of PD. The authors' study did not reveal any significant difference in terms of olfactory abilities between patients with or without OHs. However, olfactory impairment is well documented in Parkinsonian patients and cannot be totally ruled out as a risk factor for OHs. The authors recognise that complex mechanisms are probably involved in this phenomenon.

23948910|t|Amyloid-beta deposition and olfactory dysfunction in an Alzheimer's disease model.
23948910|a|Olfactory dysfunction is closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet the mechanism behind this dysfunction remains largely unknown. To clarify the relationship between olfactory and memory deficits, we assessed behavioral and olfactory system pathology in AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice using the olfactory threshold test, the Morris water maze, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and thioflavine-s staining. Western blotting revealed the following spatial-temporal deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta): appeared in the olfactory epithelium at 1-2 months old (mo); expanded to the olfactory bulb at 3-4 mo; expanded to the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus at 6-7 mo; and increased with age (9-10 mo) in the more central cortices. IHC staining showed similar results, but the appearance time points for the spotty signals in these brain regions were earlier due to the higher spatial resolution compared with Western blotting. The spread of Abeta deposits from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and piriform cotex (faint) at 3-4 mo correlated with the olfactory detection deficit found at the corresponding age; and the high level of depositions in the more central regions at 9-10 mo correlated with spatial memory deficit at the same age. We also found that a decline in the levels of olfactory marker protein, a marker of functioning olfactory sensory neuron, coincided with soluble Abeta aggregates from a very early age in the olfactory epithelium, indicating early olfactory sensory neuron degeneration in the AbetaPP/PS1 mouse as in AD patients. The current data suggest that the early deposition of soluble Abeta aggregates in the olfactory system and the early deficit in olfactory dysfunction have the potential to serve as molecular markers for the early diagnosis of AD.

23965402|t|Dysfunctional chemosensation in myasthenia gravis: a systematic review.
23965402|a|OBJECTIVES: Myasthenia gravis has traditionally been viewed as a disorder that solely affects the neuromuscular junction within the peripheral nervous system. However, there is now evidence that the cholinergic dysfunction of this disorder may be more widespread than previously believed. This article provides a systematic review of the studies that examined smell and taste function in myasthenia gravis. METHODS: We analyzed studies that reported chemosensory function alterations in patients with myasthenia gravis. PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, and SciELO, searched to identify articles published from January 1950 through December 2012, were supplemented by relevant articles. The following information was identified from each article: the number of patients, number of controls (if any), clinical stage of patients, neurological involvement, serological state, taste or smell involvement, chemosensory test used, and country of publication. RESULTS: Ten studies reporting smell and taste function and dysfunction in patients with myasthenia gravis were identified, most of which were case reports commenting on apparent abnormalities in the taste system. The sole empirical study that investigated taste function, however, was negative, suggesting that some reports of taste loss may reflect olfactory loss. One study clearly documented olfactory dysfunction in patients with myasthenia gravis, dysfunction most likely attributable to altered central nervous system cholinergic function. CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensory dysfunction has been reported in a number of patients with myasthenia gravis. Given the close association between complaints of taste dysfunction and loss of flavor sensations secondary to olfactory system damage, quantitative testing should be used to accurately assess the nature and degree of the dysfunction present in this debilitating disorder.

24136244|t|Hyposmia: a possible biomarker of Parkinson's disease.
24136244|a|Hyposmia, identified as reduced sensitivity to odor, is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that antedates the typical motor symptoms by several years. It occurs in ~90% of early-stage cases of PD. In addition to the high prevalence, the occurrence of hyposmia may also predict a higher risk of PD. Investigations into hyposmia and its relationship with PD may help elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review provides an update of olfactory dysfunction in PD and its potential as a biomarker for this devastating disease.

24742666|t|The lateralized smell test for detecting Alzheimer's disease: failure to replicate.
24742666|a|OBJECTIVES: A widely publicized study by Stamps, Bartoshuk and Heilman (2013) reported that a simple measure of left:right naris differences in the ability to detect the odor of peanut butter is a sensitive marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients were said to have abnormal smell function on the left side of the nose and normal function on right side of the nose. In light of its implications for medical practice and the world-wide publicity that it engendered, we sought to replicate and expand this work. METHODS: Two studies were performed. In the first, 15 AD patients were tested according to the procedures described by Stamps et al. in which the nostril contralateral to the tested side was occluded by the patient using lateral pressure from the index finger. Since this can potentially distort the contralateral naris, we repeated the testing using tape for naris occlusion. In the second, 20 AD patients were administered 20 odors of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) to each side of the nose, with the contralateral naris being closed with tape. In both studies, the order of the side of testing was systematically counterbalanced. RESULTS: No evidence of a left:right asymmetry on any test measure was observed. CONCLUSION: Although hyposmia is well-established in AD, no meaningful asymmetry in smell perception is apparent. If olfactory function on the right side of the nose was normal as claimed, then AD patients should exhibit normal function when tested bilaterally, a phenomenon not seen in dozens of AD-related olfactory studies.

24976213|t|Suprathreshold odor intensity perception in early-stage Parkinson's disease.
24976213|a|BACKGROUND: Whether Parkinson's disease (PD) influences suprathreshold changes in perceived odor intensity is unknown. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with schizophrenia, and the elderly, such perception is reportedly normal. If generally true, this could reflect a core element of the olfactory system insulated to some degree from age- and disease-related pathological conditions. METHODS: Odor intensity ratings for pentyl acetate were obtained from 29 early-stage PD patients when on and off dopamine-related medications (DRMs) and from 29 matched controls. RESULTS: The ratings were significantly attenuated at the higher odorant concentrations, with the degree of attenuation associated with overall olfactory dysfunction. Ratings were higher on the right than on the left side of the nose of both patients and controls. No associations with DRMs, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, or striatal dopamine transporter imaging were found. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease (PD) influences suprathreshold estimates of perceived odor intensity, negating the notion that such perception might be spared in this disease. No association with dopaminergic processes was apparent.

25053174|t|The role of olfactory challenge tests in incipient dementia and clinical trial design.
25053174|a|The brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop slowly over many years before the onset of dementia. Biomarkers for AD that allow its detection during this clinically silent phase will be hugely important when disease-modifying treatments that halt or slow its progression become available. Early detection, leading to early treatment, may in some cases avert dementia. Biomarkers aid our understanding of the presymptomatic stages of the disease and enable the identification of individuals with early disease who, by participating in clinical trials of investigational treatments with disease-modifying potential, contribute unique and vital information necessary to evaluate novel therapies. Most currently available AD biomarkers are expensive and not widely available and there are major efforts underway to find cheaper, simpler options. The olfactory system is affected by AD and the results from simple and inexpensive tests of the sense of smell, especially when paired with other information, can help identify individuals early in the disease. We review recent literature relevant to the use of simple olfactory tests, including some novel approaches, as aids to the early detection of AD. We consider their possible role in the design and conduct of clinical trials and suggest how in the future, when more effective treatments become available, they might be integrated into screening programs for early AD detection.

25172126|t|Olfactory dysfunction in incidental Lewy body disease and Parkinson's disease.
25172126|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is well-established and may represent one of the earliest signs of the disease. OBJECTIVE & METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of olfactory dysfunction, using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), to clinical and pathological parameters of clinicopathologically diagnosed PD (n = 10), incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD) (n = 13), and identically assessed controls who lacked a neurodegenerative disease (n = 69). RESULTS: Mean UPSIT scores were significantly lower in PD (16.3, p < 0.001) and ILBD (22.2, p = 0.004) compared to controls (27.7). Using an UPSIT cutoff score of <22 (the 15th percentile) the sensitivity for detecting PD was 9/10 (90%) and ILBD 6/13 (46%), while the specificity was 86% (Controls with score of <22 = 10/69). CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that olfactory testing could be useful as a screening tool for identifying early, pre-motor PD.

25177842|t|Olfactory assays for mouse models of neurodegenerative disease.
25177842|a|In many neurodegenerative diseases and particularly in Parkinson's disease, deficits in olfaction are reported to occur early in the disease process and may be a useful behavioral marker for early detection. Earlier detection in neurodegenerative disease is a major goal in the field because this is when neuroprotective therapies have the best potential to be effective. Therefore, in preclinical studies testing novel neuroprotective strategies in rodent models of neurodegenerative disease, olfactory assessment could be highly useful in determining therapeutic potential of compounds and translation to the clinic. In the present study we describe a battery of olfactory assays that are useful in measuring olfactory function in mice. The tests presented in this study were chosen because they measure olfaction abilities in mice related to food odors, social odors, and non-social odors. These tests have proven useful in characterizing novel genetic mouse models of Parkinson's disease as well as in testing potential disease-modifying therapies.

25373810|t|Nonmotor Symptoms and Cognitive Decline in de novo Parkinson's Disease.
25373810|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its clinical importance, the development of dementia is still difficult to predict. In this study, we investigated the possible associations between non-motor symptoms and the risk of developing dementia within a 2-year observation period in PD. METHODS: A total of 80 patients with PD participated in this study. Nonmotor symptoms (the Nonmotor Symptoms Questionnaire), PD status (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), depression (Geriatric d Depression Scale or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale), stereopsis and severity of nonmotor symptoms (Non-motor symptoms scale) were assessed. Global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) were evaluated at baseline and 2 years later. RESULTS: Presence of depression, vivid dreaming, REM sleep behavior disorders, hyposmia, abnormal stereopsis, non-smoking and postural instability/ gait disturbance phenotype were associated with a significantly more rapid decline of Mini-Mental State Examination. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that depression (odds ratio=13.895), abnormal stereopsis (odds ratio=10.729), vivid dreaming (odds ratio=4.16), REM sleep behavior disorders (odds ratio=5.353) and hyposmia (odds ratio=4.911) were significant independent predictors of dementia risk within 2 years. Postural instability/ gait disturbance phenotype and age >62 years were also independent predictors of dementia risk (odd ratio=38.333, odds ratio=10.625). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that depression, vivid dreaming, REM sleep behavior disorders, hyposmia and abnormal stereopsis are closely associated with cognitive decline, and that presence of these nonmotor symptoms predict the subsequent development of Parkinson's disease dementia.

25471394|t|Olfactory deficits predict cognitive decline and Alzheimer dementia in an urban community.
25471394|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive utility of baseline odor identification deficits for future cognitive decline and the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. METHODS: In a multiethnic community cohort in North Manhattan, NY, 1,037 participants without dementia were evaluated with the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). In 757 participants, follow-up occurred at 2 years and 4 years. RESULTS: In logistic regression analyses, lower baseline UPSIT scores were associated with cognitive decline (relative risk 1.067 per point interval; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.040, 1.095; p < 0.0001), and remained significant (relative risk 1.065 per point interval; 95% CI 1.034, 1.095; p < 0.0001) after including covariates. UPSIT, but not Selective Reminding Test-total immediate recall, predicted cognitive decline in participants without baseline cognitive impairment. During follow-up, 101 participants transitioned to AD dementia. In discrete time survival analyses, lower baseline UPSIT scores were associated with transition to AD dementia (hazard ratio 1.099 per point interval; 95% CI 1.067, 1.131; p < 0.0001), and remained highly significant (hazard ratio 1.072 per point interval; 95% CI 1.036, 1.109; p < 0.0001) after including demographic, cognitive, and functional covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment in odor identification was superior to deficits in verbal episodic memory in predicting cognitive decline in cognitively intact participants. The findings support the cross-cultural use of a relatively inexpensive odor identification test as an early biomarker of cognitive decline and AD dementia. Such testing may have the potential to select/stratify patients in treatment trials of cognitively impaired patients or prevention trials in cognitively intact individuals.

25480568|t|Taste function in early stage treated and untreated Parkinson's disease.
25480568|a|Since brain stem regions associated with early Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology encroach upon those involved in taste function, the ability to taste may be compromised in PD. However, studies on this point have been contradictory. We administered well-validated whole-mouth and regional taste tests that incorporated multiple concentrations of sucrose, citric acid, caffeine, and sodium chloride to 29 early stage PD patients and 29 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls. Electrogustometry was also performed on the anterior tongue. The PD cohort was tested both on and off dopamine-related medications in counterbalanced test sessions. While whole-mouth taste identification test scores for all stimuli were, on average, nominally lower for the PD patients than for the controls, a trend in the opposite direction was noted for the intensity ratings at the lower stimulus concentrations for all stimuli except caffeine. Moreover, regional testing found that PD subjects tended to rate the stimuli, relative to the controls, as more intense on the anterior tongue and less intense on the posterior tongue. No significant associations were evident between taste test scores and UPDRS scores, L-DOPA medication equivalency values, or [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging of dopamine transporter uptake within the striatum and associated regions. Our findings suggest that suprathreshold measures of taste function are influenced by PD and that this disease differentially influences taste function on anterior (CN VII) and posterior (CN IX) tongue regions. Conceivably PD-related damage to CN IX releases central inhibition on CN VII at the level of the brainstem, resulting in enhanced taste intensity on the anterior tongue.

25535137|t|Olfactory disfunction and its relation olfactory bulb volume in Parkinson's disease.
25535137|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory dysfunction is the most frequently seen non-motor symptom of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The aim of this study is to analyze selective olfactory dysfunction, and olfactory bulb volume (OBV) in subtypes of IPD, and compare them with those of the healthy controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study included 41 patients with IPD and age and gender matched 19 healthy controls. IPD patients were either tremor dominant (65.9%; TDPD) or non-tremor dominant (34.1%; NTDPD) type. All patients underwent neurological, ear, nose, and throat examinations, and orthonasal olfaction testing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique was used to measure the volume of the olfactory bulb. RESULTS: A significant decrease in olfactory identification scores was found in the patient group. The patients had difficulty in discriminating between odors of mothballs, chocolate, Turkish coffee and soap. OBV did not differ between the patient, and the control groups. In the TDPD group, odor identification ability was decreased when compared to the control group. However, odor test results of NTDPD, control and TDPD groups were similar. OBV estimates of the TDPD group were not different from those of the control group, while in the NTDPD group OBVs were found to be decreased. In all patients with Parkinson's disease OBV values did not vary with age of the patients, duration of the disease, age at onset of the disease, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores (UPDRS-m). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory function is a complex process involving olfactory, and cortical structures as well. In Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, changes in OBV do not seem to be directly related to olfactory dysfunction.

25545729|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: Positive effect of cigarette smoking.
25545729|a|BACKGROUND: There is compelling evidence from over 60 epidemiological studies that smoking significantly reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). In general, those who currently smoke cigarettes, as well as those with a past history of such smoking, have a reduced risk of PD compared to those who have never smoked. Recently it has been suggested that a cardinal nonmotor sensory symptom of PD, olfactory dysfunction, may be less severe in PD patients who smoke than in PD patients who do not, in contrast to the negative effect of smoking on olfaction described in the general population. METHODS: We evaluated University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) scores from 323 PD patients and 323 controls closely matched individually on age, sex, and smoking history (never, past, or current). RESULTS: Patients exhibited much lower UPSIT scores than did the controls (P < 0.0001). The relative decline in dysfunction of the current PD smokers was less than that of the never- and past-PD smokers (respective Ps = 0.0005 and 0.0019). Female PD patients outperformed their male counterparts by a larger margin than did the female controls (3.66 vs. 1.07 UPSIT points; respective Ps < 0.0001 and 0.06). Age-related declines in UPSIT scores were generally present (P < 0.0001). No association between the olfactory measure and smoking dose, as indexed by pack-years, was evident. CONCLUSIONS: PD patients who currently smoke do not exhibit the smoking-related decline in olfaction observed in non-PD control subjects who currently smoke. The physiological basis of this phenomenon is yet to be defined.

25614440|t|Olfactory identification in amnestic and non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment and its neuropsychological correlates.
25614440|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory identification impairment in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients is well documented and considered to be caused by underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, contrasting with less clear evidence in non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). The aim was to (a) compare the degree of olfactory identification dysfunction in aMCI, naMCI, controls and mild AD dementia and (b) assess the relation between olfactory identification and cognitive performance in aMCI compared to naMCI. METHODS: 75 patients with aMCI and 32 with naMCI, 26 patients with mild AD and 27 controls underwent the multiple choice olfactory identification Motol Hospital Smell Test with 18 different odors together with a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. RESULTS: Controlling for age and gender, patients with aMCI and naMCI did not differ significantly in olfactory identification and both performed significantly worse than controls (p<0.001), albeit also better than patients with mild AD (p<.001). In the aMCI group, higher scores on MMSE, verbal and non-verbal memory and visuospatial tests were significantly related to better olfactory identification ability. Conversely, no cognitive measure was significantly related to olfactory performance in naMCI. CONCLUSION: Olfactory identification is similarly impaired in aMCI and naMCI. Olfactory impairment is proportional to cognitive impairment in aMCI but not in naMCI.

25757648|t|Pattern of Smell Identification Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.
25757648|a|Olfactory dysfunction in general, and impaired odor identification in particular, have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory testing may be a useful diagnostic aid for AD, but the types of odor most commonly affected need to be identified. This study aimed to determine pattern and types of odor affected in AD with the goal of improving clinical applicability. 54 outpatients with mild to moderate AD and 40 age and gender-matched non-demented controls (NDC) were tested using British version of University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT; Sensonics, Inc., Haddon Heights, NJ) and data analyzed to identify an optimal subset of UPSIT to best differentiate AD patients from controls. AD subjects had significantly lower UPSIT total scores than NDC. Random Forest with backward elimination identified 12 UPSIT items which accurately differentiated AD patients compared to controls (sensitivity, 0.89 and specificity, 0.83, positive predictive value of 0.889, and negative predictive value of 0.833). The 12 smell items found to be most affected in AD subjects reflects important attributes such as safety and food, known to be affected in people with AD and that has the potential to impair activities of daily living. The 12 items of British UPSIT most affected in AD subjects provides a potential brief scale for early detection of AD in clinical settings. Independent replication is needed to validate these findings.

25869786|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory impairment and the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The associated neuropathology originates in brain areas responsible for olfaction, which makes olfactory tasks potentially useful for assessing AD. The strongest genetic risk factor for AD is the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 allele that has been associated with increased cognitive and olfactory deficits. While individuals carrying one e4 allele of the ApoE gene are at increased risk for AD relative to non-carriers, those with two copies of the e4 allele demonstrate an even higher risk for developing AD. Furthermore, homozygous ApoE e4/4 individuals diagnosed with AD are known to have heightened amyloid burden and a more rapid rate of cognitive decline relative to heterozygous e3/4 ApoE carriers. All of these factors suggest there are differences in severity and progression of AD as a function of possessing one versus two e4 alleles. The current study investigated olfactory functioning in homozygous e4/4 older adults diagnosed with probable AD. Compared to demographically matched e3/3 and e3/4 individuals, e4/4 individuals showed deficits in odor identification and remote odor memory as measured by odor familiarity ratings. The current findings suggest that these particular domains of olfactory functioning may be more impaired in AD e4/4 homozygotes compared to e3/4 heterozygotes and e3/3 homozygotes. These deficits give insight into how the presence of two e4 alleles may differentially affect the progression of AD and suggest the usefulness of odor tasks in detecting those at risk for AD.

26402003|t|Olfactory Dysfunction, Olfactory Bulb Volume and Alzheimer's Disease: Is There a Correlation? A Pilot Study1.
26402003|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is present since the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD patients, the olfactory impairment has been correlated with atrophy of some structures of the olfactory system, but the role of the olfactory bulb remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our work is to test if patients suffering from AD exhibit a statistically significant reduction of the average volume of the olfactory bulb (OBV) compared to healthy subjects. METHODS: 78 subjects were enrolled in the study and divided into three groups: 28 healthy elderly (22 females, 6 males, mean age 69.4 +- 9.2), 25 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) amnestic type (14 females, 11 males, mean age 74.5 +- 7.5), and 25 mild AD patients (14 females, 11 males, mean age 73.7 +- 6.8). Every subject underwent an MRI study of the olfactory bulb and an olfactory assessment with the Sniffin' Stick Extended Test. RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed no correlation between the OBV and MCI or AD. Moreover, olfactory function and OBV were not correlated in any of the three groups. CONCLUSION: The reduction of OBV does not seem to represent an index of neuronal damage in the earliest stages of AD.

26412299|t|Assessing Olfactory Function in Parkinson's Disease via Entropy Analysis of Chemosensory Event Related Potentials.
26412299|a|The relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) and olfactory dysfunction has been investigated via psychophysical and electrophysiological assessments. Despite the increasing number of electrophysiological studies focusing on olfactory function, there are still some limitations to observe the chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERP), which are electrophysiological responses of the brain to olfactory and trigeminal stimulations, because of the low sensitivity (low signal-to-noise ratio). Recent studies attempted to establish new techniques to increase the sensitivity for evaluating the CSERP and brain responsiveness. We aimed to inspect CSERP via entropy analysis in assessing chemosensory related brain responses that has been used for the first time. Twelve newly diagnosed and non-medicated PD patients and 12 healthy subjects participated in the study. Psychophysical and electrophysiological evaluation of olfaction were assessed via Sniffin' Sticks Test (SST) and entropy analysis on CSERP in three time windows. The scores of odor threshold, odor identification and total scores of SST were lower (hyposmic) in PD patients compared to healthy subjects. Electrophysiological assessments revealed a significant change in entropy among time windows for olfactory stimulation with phenyl ethyl alcohol and trigeminal stimulation with carbon dioxide (both p < 0.05) in healthy subjects but not in PD patients. Entropy findings indicate that the brain operates in ordered state among healthy subjects in response to olfactory/trigeminal stimuli, whereas the PD patients displayed a chaotic pattern. This pattern in the PD patients suggests the lack of proper smell function. It should be studied if this pattern can be used as a biomarker for PD.

27427537|t|Taste detection and recognition thresholds in Japanese patients with Alzheimer-type dementia.
27427537|a|OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer-type dementia (AD) is pathologically characterized by massive neuronal loss in the brain, and the taste cortex is thought to be affected. However, there are only a few reports regarding the gustatory function of AD patients, and the conclusions of this research are inconsistent. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 22 consecutive patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer-type dementia (AD) with mean age of 84.0 years, and 49 elderly volunteers without dementia with mean age of 71.0 years as control subjects. The control subjects were divided into two groups according to age: a younger group (N=28, mean age: 68.5) and an older group (N=21, mean age: 83.0). The gustatory function was investigated using the filter paper disc method (FPD) and electrogustometry (EGM). RESULTS: The gustatory function as measured by the FPD was significantly impaired in patients with AD as compared with age-matched control subjects; no such difference was found between the younger and the older control groups. On the other hand, as for the EGM thresholds, there were no differences between the AD patient group and the age-matched controls. CONCLUSION: The FPD method demonstrated decreased gustatory function in AD patients beyond that of aging. On the other hand, EGM thresholds did not differ between the AD patient group and the age-matched controls. These results suggest that failure of taste processing in the brain, but not taste transmission in the peripheral taste system, occurs in patients with AD.

27734639|t|University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test Abnormalities in Parkinson's Disease.
27734639|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a predominant non - motor symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease. Indian studies on olfactory loss using standardized kits are lacking. OBJECTIVE: 1) To assess the olfactory impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease 2) To verify the applicability of UPSIT to Indian subjects 3) To assess the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and duration, stage and severity of the illness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Parkinson's disease attending Neurology outpatient and inpatient departments were taken for the study. The details of demographic data and illness were collected. Patients with other risk factors for hyposmia were excluded from the study. Detailed neurological examination and smell test were done using University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) kit. 40 healthy individuals without any pre-morbid illness or risk factors for hyposmia were studied for the applicability of the British version of UPSIT to the Indian population, 20 of whom were age and sex matched with the Parkinson's disease patients. Statistical analysis was done using Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-ranks test (WSRT)) and Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: Parkinson's disease patients had a mean age 58.2 years and a mean duration of illness of 5.5 years. Parkinson's disease patients had a low score on UPSIT compared to controls which was statistically significant (p 0.000) and the loss spanned a variety of odorants in UPSIT. There was no correlation with the age, staging or duration of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory loss is a significant non motor symptom in Parkinson's disease patients and is probably not related to the disease duration, stage or severity of motor symptoms.

28107525|t|Longitudinal Testing of Olfactory and Gustatory Function in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
28107525|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate changes of the olfactory and gustatory capacity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODOLOGY: 20 MS patients were tested longitudinally for 3 years after initial testing. The Threshold Discrimination Identification test (TDI) was used for subjective olfactometry. Objective olfactometry was performed by registering olfactory evoked potentials (OEP) by EEG. The Taste Strip Test (TST) was used for gustatory testing. RESULTS: 45% of the patients showed olfactory dysfunction in the follow-up TDI test and 50% showed delayed OEP s. 20% of the patients showed gustatory dysfunction on follow-up visit. The patients showed mild disease activity with 0,3 +- 0,5 relapses over the testing period and no significant change of their olfactory and gustatory capacity. The olfactory capacity for the discrimination of odors correlated inversely with the number of relapses (r = -0.5, p <= 0.05). The patients were aware of their olfactory deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is a symptom in MS patients and may be a useful parameter to estimate disease progression in MS patients. As the discrimination of odors is processed in higher central regions of the central nervous system (CNS), the results suggest that olfactory dysfunction could be due to CNS damage.

28235778|t|Clinical evoked potentials in neurology: a review of techniques and indications.
28235778|a|Evoked potentials (EPs) are a powerful and cost-effective tool for evaluating the integrity and function of the central nervous system. Although imaging techniques, such as MRI, have recently become increasingly important in the diagnosis of neurological diseases, over the past 30 years, many neurologists have continued to employ EPs in specific clinical applications. This review presents an overview of the recent evolution of 'classical' clinical applications of EPs in terms of early diagnosis and disease monitoring and is an extension of a previous review published in this journal in 2005 by Walsh and collaborators. We also provide an update on emerging EPs based on gustatory, olfactory and pain stimulation that may be used as clinically relevant markers of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cortical or peripheral impaired pain perception. EPs based on multichannel electroencephalography recordings, known as high-density EPs, help to better differentiate between healthy subjects and patients and, moreover, they provide valuable spatial information regarding the site of the lesion. EPs are reliable disease-progression biomarkers of several neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating disorders. Overall, EPs are excellent neurophysiological tools that will expand standard clinical practice in modern neurology.

28477708|t|Impaired cholinergic transmission in patients with Parkinson's disease and olfactory dysfunction.
28477708|a|Olfactory dysfunction represents a frequent and disturbing non-motor manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD is still poorly understood. Experimental evidence suggests that olfactory impairment could be related to central cholinergic dysfunction. Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) technique gives the opportunity to test an inhibitory cholinergic circuit in the human cerebral motor cortex. The objective of the study was to assess the cholinergic function, as measured by SAI, in PD patients with different degrees of olfactory dysfunction. We applied SAI technique in 31 patients with PD. These patients also underwent Olfactory Event-Related Potentials (OERPs) studies to objectively evaluate the olfactory system and a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess the cognitive functions. Absent OERPs indicated a severe olfactory dysfunction in 13 subjects. The presence of OERPs with an alteration in latency and/or amplitude can be considered as a borderline condition of slight alteration of smell and was found in other 15 patients. Only 3 patients showed normal OERPs. SAI was significantly reduced in the PD patients with absent OERPs compared with those with present but abnormal OERPs. Neuropsychological examination showed a mild cognitive impairment in 12 out of 13 PD patients with severe olfactory dysfunction, and in 3 out of the 15 patients with borderline olfactory dysfunction. SAI abnormalities and presence of severe olfactory impairment strongly support the hypothesis of cholinergic dysfunction in some patients with PD, who will probably develop a dementia. Longitudinal studies are required to verify whether SAI abnormalities in PD patients with olfactory dysfunction can predict a future severe cognitive decline.

28523222|t|Olfaction in Parkin carriers in Chinese patients with Parkinson disease.
28523222|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory identification was reported to be better among PD (Parkinson disease) patients with Parkin mutations, but previous studies didn't eliminate the interference of other PD related genes on olfaction, and whether olfaction of Parkin mutations patients was better in Chinese population was still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess olfaction function among PD patients with Parkin mutations in Chinese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 226 PD patients with a positive family history or an early-onset age (<50 years) were enrolled for genetic testing of PD related genes by target sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. The clinical data including olfactory function test were investigated. Linear regression was performed to adjust for the covariates between all groups. RESULTS: There were 68 patients found having a negative result in PD genetic testing and 43 patients carrying homozygous or compound heterozygous Parkin mutations. Among them, 49 PD panel negative patients and 33 PD-Parkin patients had results of olfactory assessment. PD -Parkin patients performed significantly better on the Sniffin' Sticks tests than panel negative patients (8.0 +- 1.7 vs. 5.7 +- 1.9, p < .001), but still worse compared to healthy controls (9.4 +- 1.5, p = .003). These differences persisted after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese population, PD -Parkin patients had relatively preserved olfaction compared to PD panel negative patients after eliminating the interference of other PD related genes, but were still worse than healthy controls.

28550478|t|Olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease is a consequence of central nervous system decline.
28550478|a|Early diagnosis and timely treatment of Parkinson's disease are essential factors to provide these patients with a longer period of a better quality of life. Olfactory loss is among the first non-motor symptoms of the disease; however, in light of the many causes of smell loss, it is a very unspecific biomarker and should only be used as part of a diagnostic test battery. In this study, we investigated the olfactory response in 71 subjects, consisting of Parkinson's disease patients, hyposmic and anosmic patients of other causes, and normosmic individuals searching for sensitive, distinct biomarkers for which we used scalp event-related 64-channel electroencephalography and psychophysical tests. The analysis of the global field power indicated significant measurable differences between patients with Parkinson's disease and otherwise olfactory dysfunctional and normosmic individuals. The localization of brain sources, in particular, provides evidence for differences in mainly late EEG-components suggesting a decline of central brain networks as a causal factor for olfactory loss in Parkinson's disease. The findings indicate a different pattern of olfactory processing in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to olfactory dysfunctions of other origin, which provide further insights into the mechanisms behind olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's.

28644998|t|Olfactory identification deficit predicts white matter tract impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
28644998|a|Olfactory identification deficit (OID) has been associated with both aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the context of an amnestic disorders, OID predicts conversion to AD. Neuroanatomical correlates could increase specificity and sensitivity and elucidate the mechanistic differences between OID in AD and aging. Cross-sectional analysis of white matter microstructural changes was performed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tract-based-spatial-statistics in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), AD and normal controls (NC) in 66 subjects (26 AD, 15 aMCI, 25 NC). DTI 3-Tesla MRI scans were analyzed and subject level means for fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial and axial diffusivity (lambda1D and lambda2,3D) were calculated. Linear regression models were applied using DTI markers as predictor and OID as outcome. OID was associated with increased lambda1D in aMCI and increased MD, lambda1D and lambda2,3D in AD. Voxel-wise analyses revealed widespread differences in all markers in AD. There were significant differences in lambda1D in aMCI, particularly in the olfactory tract. OID is correlated with microstructural white matter changes as early as in aMCI. This study may help elucidate the biological basis for olfactory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Neuroanatomical correlates could help distinguish OID associated with AD and that associated with aging.

28671131|t|Central Olfactory Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Functional MRI Study.
28671131|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits are present in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients. However, whether these deficits are due to dysfunction of the central or peripheral olfactory nervous system remains uncertain. This question is fundamentally important for developing imaging biomarkers for AD using olfactory testing. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to use olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to further demonstrate the involvement of the central olfactory system in olfactory deficits in MCI and AD. METHODS: We investigated the central olfactory system in 27 cognitively normal controls (CN), 21 MCI, and 15 AD subjects using olfactory fMRI with an odor-visual association paradigm during which a visual cue was paired with lavender odorant (odor condition) or odorless air (no-odor condition). RESULTS: The CN subjects had significantly greater activated volume in the primary olfactory cortex during both the odor and no-odor conditions compared to either the MCI or AD groups (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the odor and no-odor conditions within each group. No-odor condition activation in AD and MCI correlated with the cognitive and olfactory assessments. CONCLUSION: The no-odor condition, allowing investigation of activation patterns when the peripheral olfactory system was not directly involved, elicited the same functional response as the odor condition for each of the three groups. Thus, the olfactory activation deficits present in AD and MCI patients are most likely caused by degeneration of the central olfactory nervous system.

28816642|t|Proteomic Analysis of the Human Olfactory Bulb.
28816642|a|The importance of olfaction to human health and disease is often underappreciated. Olfactory dysfunction has been reported in association with a host of common complex diseases, including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. For health, olfaction or the sense of smell is also important for most mammals, for optimal engagement with their environment. Indeed, animals have developed sophisticated olfactory systems to detect and interpret the rich information presented to them to assist in day-to-day activities such as locating food sources, differentiating food from poisons, identifying mates, promoting reproduction, avoiding predators, and averting death. In this context, the olfactory bulb is a vital component of the olfactory system receiving sensory information from the axons of the olfactory receptor neurons located in the nasal cavity and the first place that processes the olfactory information. We report in this study original observations on the human olfactory bulb proteome in healthy subjects, using a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach. We identified 7750 nonredundant proteins from human olfactory bulbs. Bioinformatics analysis of these proteins showed their involvement in biological processes associated with signal transduction, metabolism, transport, and olfaction. These new observations provide a crucial baseline molecular profile of the human olfactory bulb proteome, and should assist the future discovery of biomarker proteins and novel diagnostics associated with diseases characterized by olfactory dysfunction.

29470631|t|Flavor perception and the risk of malnutrition in patients with Parkinson's disease.
29470631|a|Flavor perception involves both olfactory and gustatory function. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), hyposmia is a frequent finding, as well as an increased risk of malnutrition. We performed a pilot study to investigate the relationship between flavor perception and risk of malnutrition in PD patients. 63 PD patients participated to perform an olfactory (Sniffin' Sticks) and gustatory (Taste Strips) task, and a questionnaire to establish nutritional risk (MUST), which includes BMI measurements. The relationship between olfactory and gustatory function and BMI was analyzed using partial correlations, corrected for disease duration, and regression analysis. Patients displayed a high prevalence of hyposmia (68.3%), and a low prevalence (6.3%) of hypogeusia. A small, but significant correlation was found between olfactory function and BMI (r = 0.261, p = 0.038), and not for gustatory function and BMI (r = 0.137, p = 0.284). Hyposmia, and not hypogeusia, may contribute to weight loss in Parkinson's disease, and hence increase the risk of malnutrition.

29548954|t|Effects of Subthalamic Stimulation on Olfactory Function in Parkinson Disease.
29548954|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a nonmotor symptom of Parkinson disease (PD) associated with reduction in quality of life. There is no evidence on whether improvements in olfaction after subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) may be directly attributable to motor improvement or whether this reflects a direct effect of DBS on olfactory brain areas. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of DBS on olfactory function in PD, as well as to explore the correlation between these changes and changes in motor symptoms and brain metabolism. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with PD were screened for STN-DBS. Patients were evaluated before and 1 year after surgery. Primary outcome was the change in olfactory function (Sniffin' Sticks odor-identification test [SST]) after surgery among the patients with hyposmia at baseline. Secondary outcomes included the relationship between motor outcomes and olfactory changes and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography analysis between subgroups with improvement versus no improvement of smell. RESULTS: STN-DBS improved SST after surgery (preoperative SST, median 7.3 +- 2.4 vs. postoperative SST, median 8.2 +- 2.1; P = 0.045) in a subset of patients among 29 of 32 patients who presented with hyposmia at baseline. The improvement in SST was correlated with DBS response (r = 0.424; P = 0.035). There was also an increase in glucose metabolism in the midbrain, cerebellum, and right frontal lobe in patients with SST improvement (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: STN-DBS improves odor identification in a subset of patients with PD. Motor improvement together with changes in the brain metabolism may be linked to this improvement.

29575306|t|6-n-propylthiouracil taste disruption and TAS2R38 nontasting form in Parkinson's disease.
29575306|a|BACKGROUND: The few studies that evaluated taste function in Parkinson's disease (PD) showed inconsistent results. The inherited ability to taste the bitter compound of 6-n-propylthiouracil has been considered to be a paradigm of general taste perception. 6-n-propylthiouracil taste perception is mediated by the TAS2R38 receptor, and reduced 6-n-propylthiouracil sensitivity has been associated with several diseases not typically related to taste function. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the 6-n-propylthiouracil taste perception and the TAS2R38 gene as genetic risk factors for the development of idiopathic PD in PD patients and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: The 6-n-propylthiouracil taste perception was assessed by testing the responsiveness, and the ability to recognize, 6-n-propylthiouracil and sodium chloride. The participants were classified for 6-n-propylthiouracil taster status and genotyped for the TAS2R38 gene. RESULTS: A significant increase in the frequency of participants classified as 6-n-propylthiouracil nontasters and a reduced ability to recognize bitter taste quality of 6-n-propylthiouracil were found in PD patients when compared with healthy controls. The results also showed that only 5% of PD patients had the homozygous genotype for the dominant tasting variant of TAS2R38, whereas most of them carried the recessive nontaster form and a high number had a rare variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that 6-n-propylthiouracil taster status and TAS2R38 locus are associated with PD. The 6-n-propylthiouracil test may therefore represent a novel, simple way to identify increased vulnerability to PD. Moreover, the presence of the nontasting form of TAS2R38 in PD may further substantiate that disease-associated taste disruption may represent a risk factor associated with the disease.   2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

29652815|t|Olfactory Dysfunction as a Global Biomarker for Sniffing out Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
29652815|a|Cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are rising exponentially due to increasing global life expectancy. There are approximately 50 million sufferers worldwide, with prevalence rising most rapidly in low-income countries such as Africa and Asia. There is currently no definite diagnosis of AD until after death, thus an early biomarker for AD is urgently required in order to administer timelier and more effective interventions. Olfactory dysfunction (problems with the sense of smell) is one of the earliest, preclinical symptoms observed in AD. Olfaction is a promising early biomarker for use worldwide as it is easy, cheap to measure, and not reliant on specialist clinicians or laboratory analysis. We carried out a meta-analysis to determine the credibility of olfaction in diagnosing AD in the preclinical stages, by comparing olfaction in healthy controls against AD patients and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data from 10 articles were subjected to two comparative meta-analyses. In the case of AD, the results illustrated that the overall magnitude of effect size was more apparent, d = -1.63, 95% CI [-1.95, -1.31], in comparison to that of MCI, d = -0.81, 95% CI [-1.08, -0.55]. This shows that olfaction worsens progressively as patients progress from MCI to AD, highlighting the potential for olfactory dysfunction to identify AD in the preclinical stages prior to MCI.

29762752|t|Variability and Coupling of Olfactory Identification and Episodic Memory in Older Adults.
29762752|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether assessment-to-assessment fluctuations in episodic memory (EM) reflect fluctuations in olfaction over time. METHODS: Within-person coupled variation in EM and the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) was examined in 565 participants aged 58-106 with autopsy data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. A growth model for up to 15 years of EM data, with BSIT as time-varying covariate, was estimated accounting for main effects of sex, education, epsilon4 allele, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, BSIT and time-varying BSIT, as well as the interaction between AD pathology and time-varying BSIT. RESULTS: Individuals with higher BSIT scores (b = .01, standard error [SE] = .004, p = .009) had slower declines in EM. High AD pathology (b = -.06, SE = .02, p = .001) was associated with more rapid declines in EM. The association between time-specific fluctuations in EM and BSIT differed by level of AD pathology (b = .08, SE = .034, p = .028), with a higher EM-BSIT association at higher levels of pathology. DISCUSSION: BSIT and EM fluctuate together over measurement occasions, particularly for individuals with AD pathology. Repeated intraindividual measurements provide information that could lead to early detection and inexpensive monitoring of accumulating AD pathology.

29925486|t|Striatal dopamine uptake and olfactory dysfunction in patients with early Parkinson's disease.
29925486|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction is a sensitive biomarker of neurodegeneration and a cardinal premotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although several non-motor symptoms of PD have been correlated with decreased dopamine transporter uptake, olfactory dysfunction and reduced dopamine transporter uptake have not been widely investigated in PD. In this study, we aimed to identify the dopamine transporter status of the corpus striatum and thalamus using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided spatial normalization method in patients with PD according to olfactory function. METHODS: Among 87 PD patients, 50 had hyposmia and 37 had normosmia. All patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (18F-FP-CIT) and T1-weighted MRI. PET images were normalized with simultaneously performed spatially normalized MRI and the regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) with a volume of interest template were compared according to olfactory function. RESULTS: The bilateral caudates and the left anterior and posterior putamen of the hyposmic group showed significantly reduced dopamine transporter uptake compared to the normosmic group. In partial correlation coefficient analysis, olfactory identification impairment was correlated with the SUVR values of the caudate nuclei. CONCLUSION: More dopaminergic impairment of the bilateral caudate nuclei was found in hyposmic PD. This finding suggests that decreased dopamine uptake in the caudate nucleus may be an imaging trace of olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD.

29940577|t|Distinctive Olfactory Pattern in Parkinson's Disease and Non-Neurodegenerative Causes of Hyposmia.
29940577|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). The characteristics of the hyposmia in PD have not been well defined. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the pattern of the olfactory deficit in PD and in other non-neurodegenerative aetiologies of hyposmia. METHODS: We evaluated 36 PD patients, 20 patients with hyposmia secondary to acute respiratory infection (ARI), and 19 patients with hyposmia secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). For comparison purposes, we included a group of 15 controls age and sex matched with PD patients. PD patients were classified based on disease duration and severity in de novo PD, and PD with and without chronic levodopa-related complications. The Barcelona Smell Identification Test was applied to all participants. RESULTS: For the first cranial nerve odours, PD patients scored lower than controls on smell detection (85.28 vs. 97.67%, p = 0.006), definition (79.58 vs. 93.33%, p = 0.007), recognition (63.33 vs. 81%, p = 0.020), and forced choice (58.06 vs. 82%, p < 0.001). Compared with ARI, forced choice was significantly better in PD patients (p < 0.001), but no differences were found regarding other olfactory characteristics. TBI patients showed significantly lower scores than the other study groups in all the olfaction items. For the fifth cranial nerve odours, recognition (p = 0.003) and identification (p = 0.019) were lower in the TBI group than in the others. No differences were found among PD subgroups regarding any olfactory characteristic. CONCLUSIONS: A differential pattern of hyposmia was observed in PD patients compared to other non-neurodegenerative aetiologies. Further studies with larger samples should replicate our results.

30298527|t|Invited Review: From nose to gut - the role of the microbiome in neurological disease.
30298527|a|Inflammation and neurodegeneration are key features of many chronic neurological diseases, yet the causative mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. There has been mounting interest in the role of the human microbiome in modulating the inflammatory milieu of the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease. To date, most research has focussed on a gut-brain axis, with other mucosal surfaces being relatively neglected. We herein take the novel approach of comprehensively reviewing the roles of the microbiome across several key mucosal interfaces - the nose, mouth, lung and gut - in health and in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This review systematically appraises the anatomical and microbiological landscape of each mucosal surface in health and disease before considering relevant mechanisms that may influence the initiation and progression of PD, AD and MS. The cumulative effects of dysbiosis from the nose to the gut may contribute significantly to neurological disease through a wide variety of mechanisms, including direct translocation of bacteria and their products, and modulation of systemic or CNS-specific immunity. This remains an understudied and exciting area for future research and may lead to the development of therapeutic targets for chronic neurological disease.

30342273|t|Unveiling the olfactory proteostatic disarrangement in Parkinson's disease by proteome-wide profiling.
30342273|a|Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest features in Lewy-type alpha-synucleinopathies (LTSs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms associated to smell impairment are poorly understood. Applying mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics in postmortem olfactory bulbs across limbic, early-neocortical, and neocortical LTS stages of parkinsonian patients, a proteostasis impairment, was observed, identifying 268 differentially expressed proteins between controls and PD phenotypes. In addition, network-driven proteomics revealed a modulation in ERK1/2, MKK3/6, and PDK1/PKC signaling axes. Moreover, a cross-disease study of selected olfactory molecules in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases revealed different protein derangements in the modulation of secretagogin (SCGN), calcyclin-binding protein (CACYBP), and glucosamine 6 phosphate isomerase 2 (GNPDA2) between PD and AD. An inverse correlation between GNPDA2 and alpha-synuclein protein levels was also reflected in PD cerebrospinal fluid. Interestingly, PD patients exhibited significantly lower serum GNPDA2 levels than controls (n = 82/group). Our study provides important avenues for understanding the olfactory bulb proteostasis imbalance in PD, deciphering mechanistic clues to the equivalent smell deficits observed in AD and PD pathologies.

30453770|t|Olfactory and cognitive functioning in patients with fibromyalgia.
30453770|a|Fibromyalgia is a complex syndrome characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain. Previous research has found impaired olfactory function and cognitive deficits in patients with fibromyalgia. In non-clinical population (middle-aged and elderly populations) an association has been found between olfactory function and cognitive impairment. Therefore, olfactory impairment identification could be considered as a reliable and early marker predicting the decline of cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognitive and olfactory functioning has not been studied in fibromyalgia patients. The aims of the study have been to analyze the cognitive and olfactory functioning and their association in a sample of women with fibromyalgia in comparison to women without a chronic pain disease. A transversal study was conducted with fibromyalgia patients (n = 146) and women without a chronic pain disease (n = 122). Data were collected using the WAIS-III (cognitive functioning) and the CCCRC test (olfactory functioning). Descriptive analysis, Student's t test and chi-square tests were conducted. There were significant differences in perceptive organization and processing speed, and in odour identification, odour threshold and total CCCRC score; the lower scores were for fibromyalgia patients. Among the fibromyalgia patients there were significant differences in the verbal scale, the manipulative scale, the total scale and processing speed between normosmic and hyposmic patients, the lowest scores were for hyposmic patients. Although previous literature has shown that self-reports by fibromyalgia patients inform about an enhanced olfactory acuity, the current study suggests that there are deficits in olfactory functioning in these patients. Also, the relationship between olfactory and cognitive functioning in fibromyalgia patients, due to the lack of previous studies, suggests a new line of research. Taken together, these results suggest that olfactory functioning could be included in a bio-psycho-social approach of fibromyalgia patients, because of the association with cognitive functioning.

30612044|t|Smell status in functional movement disorders: New clues for diagnosis and underlying mechanisms.
30612044|a|OBJECTIVE: Functional movement disorders (FMDs) mimic a range of movements, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders known to have smell dysfunction, which has been neglected in terms of its application to FMD. We aim to determine the smell status in FMD patients tested by a non-invasive, reliable and validated olfactory test. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We quantitatively assessed in thirty-five FMD patients their smell status and compared it to that of healthy age- and sex-matched controls, and of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). All participants were administered the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), a standardized short version of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The Picture Identification Test (PIT), a visual test analogous in content and form to the UPSIT designed to control for non-olfactory cognitive confounds, was also administered. RESULTS: The B-SIT scores of the FMD patients were higher than those from PD patients [respective means (standard deviations: SDs) = FMD, 9.54 (1.57); PD, 4.64 (1.05), p < 0.01)] but similar to the smell scores from healthy controls [9.97 (1.77), p = 0.35]. Gender, age, time of disease onset, smoking status, and phenotypic expression did not influence the test scores. Fourteen FMD patients who mentioned having olfactory dysfunction before smell testing have their test results within normal range. PIT scores from patients and healthy controls were within normal range. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that FMD patients have normal olfactory function. Olfactory testing may be helpful in identifying and differentiating FMD from other movement, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases for which smell function is altered.

31177212|t|Clinical, Structural, and Neuropathological Features of Olfactory Dysfunction in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
31177212|a|We explored changes in clinical features and neuropathological mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction (OD) in 60 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory function was evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks test and a threshold discrimination identification (TDI) score. Based on the TDI score, we divided patients according to the presence or absence of OD (AD-OD and AD-NOD, respectively). Cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated by a series of rating scales. The volumes and cortical thickness of the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala were measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropathological protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid were measured. The frequency of OD was 50%. TDI scores were lower in the AD-OD group than in the AD-NOD group (p < 0.001). Compared with the AD-NOD group, the AD-OD group showed greater cognitive function impairments (p < 0.001), and daily living activities were more severely compromised (p = 0.019). The AD-OD group had lower hippocampal and amygdala volumes (p = 0.025, p = 0.030, respectively) and a more pronounced reduction in cortical thickness (p = 0.010). The total tau level was lower in the AD-OD group than the AD-NOD group (p = 0.040). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and thinner AD-signature cortices were associated with lower TDI scores (OR = 0.826, p < 0.001; OR = 1.433, p = 0.008). Overall, in AD patients, the impairments in olfactory discrimination and identification seem to be more correlated with cognitive levels. OD in AD may be an indicator of pathological cognitive decline and structural changes.

31980278|t|Patterns of olfactory functional networks in Parkinson's disease dementia and Alzheimer's dementia.
31980278|a|Hyposmia is common in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). We evaluated the pattern of olfactory functional connectivity (FC) in AD and PDD to uncover neural correlates that are related to olfactory dysfunction. This study enrolled 57 patients with AD and PDD and 25 control subjects. Using a seed-based approach, we compared the resting-state network from the seed-region-of-interest in the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, piriform cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) between groups. The PDD group showed lower FC with striatal-thalamic-frontal regions from the olfactory bulb than the AD group. The PDD group showed lower FC from left OFC with striatal-frontal regions and lower FC from right OFC with left fronto-temporal areas than the AD group. In a correlation analysis, the FC from left OFC with right insula that differed between the PDD and control groups was positively correlated with olfactory function. The present study demonstrated that this distinct olfactory functional network pattern may represent different neural mechanisms for olfactory dysfunction in AD and PDD.

32249295|t|Orthonasal, but not Retronasal Olfaction Is Specifically Impaired in Parkinson's Disease.
32249295|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) appears several years before the presence of motor disturbance. Olfactory testing has the potential to serve as a tool for early detection of PD, but OD is not specific to PD as it affects up to 20% of the general population. Olfaction includes an orthonasal and a retronasal components; in some forms of OD, retronasal olfactory function is preserved. We aimed to evaluate whether combined testing components allows for discriminating between PD-related OD and non-Parkinsonian OD (NPOD). The objective of this study is to orthonasal and retronasal olfactory function in PD patients and compare them to a NPOD group and to healthy controls. We hypothesized that this combined testing allows to distinguish PD patients from both other groups. We included 32 PD patients, 25 NPOD patients, and 15 healthy controls. Both olfactory components were impaired in PD and NPOD patients, compared with controls; however, NPOD patients had significantly better orthonasal scores than PD patients. Furthermore, the ratio of retronasal/orthonasal score was higher in PD than in both other groups. In the NPOD group, orthonasal and retronasal scores were significantly correlated; no such correlation could be observed in PD patients. In summary, PD patients seem to rely on compensatory mechanisms for flavor perception. Combined orthonasal and retronasal olfactory testing may contribute to differentiate PD patients from patients with NPOD.

32310189|t|Olfaction in LRRK2 Linked Parkinson's Disease: Is It Different from Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease?
32310189|a|BACKGROUND: Studies on olfaction in LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease (LRRK2-PD) have yielded variable results. The impact of smell dysfunction upon daily life activities have been rarely assessed in PD. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the olfactory deficit in LRRK2-PD and its impact on daily life activities. METHODS: Twenty-four LRRK2-PD, 40 idiopathic PD (IPD), and 49 age-sex-matched controls were interviewed about olfactory characteristics and the impact of smell on daily life activities. The Barcelona Smell Identification test (BAST-24) and the Spanish-version of the 40-item University of Pennsylvania smell test (UPSIT) were applied. RESULTS: Nineteen (79.2%) LRRK2-PD patients reported subjective smell impairment with a low impact upon daily living activities. UPSIT score was higher in LRRK2-PD than in IPD (22.54+-7.98 vs 18.84+-6.03; p = 0.042). All IPD and 95.8% LRRK2-PD patients had hyposmia/anosmia, assessed by means of the UPSIT. No differences were found between LRRK2-PD and IPD regarding smell detection, memory or forced-choice identification. CONCLUSION: Most LRRK2-PD patients reported subjective smell impairment and presented hyposmia, according to validated smell tests, with a low impact of the smell dysfunction on daily life activities.

32320406|t|Severe hyposmia distinguishes neuropathologically confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease dementia.
32320406|a|Many subjects with neuropathologically-confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are never diagnosed during life, instead being categorized as Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) or unspecified dementia. Unrecognized DLB therefore is a critical impediment to clinical studies and treatment trials of both ADD and DLB. There are studies that suggest that olfactory function tests may be able to distinguish DLB from ADD, but few of these had neuropathological confirmation of diagnosis. We compared University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) results in 257 subjects that went on to autopsy and neuropathological examination. Consensus clinicopathological diagnostic criteria were used to define ADD and DLB, as well as Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), with (PDD+AD) or without (PDD-AD) concurrent AD; a group with ADD and Lewy body disease (LBD) not meeting criteria for DLB (ADLB) and a clinically normal control group were also included. The subjects with DLB, PDD+AD and PDD-AD all had lower (one-way ANOVA p < 0.0001, pairwise Bonferroni p < 0.05) first and mean UPSIT scores than the ADD, ADLB or control groups. For DLB subjects with first and mean UPSIT scores less than 20 and 17, respectively, Firth logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender and mean MMSE score, conferred statistically significant odds ratios of 17.5 and 18.0 for the diagnosis, vs ADD. For other group comparisons (PDD+AD and PDD-AD vs ADD) and UPSIT cutoffs of 17, the same analyses resulted in odds ratios ranging from 16.3 to 31.6 (p < 0.0001). To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date comparing olfactory function in subjects with neuropathologically-confirmed LBD and ADD. Olfactory function testing may be a convenient and inexpensive strategy for enriching dementia studies or clinical trials with DLB subjects, or conversely, reducing the inclusion of DLB subjects in ADD studies or trials.

32331947|t|Validation of a new olfactory test for Chinese Parkinson's disease patients.
32331947|a|INTRODUCTION: Hyposmia is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been used to assist PD diagnosis and early screening of prodromal patients. Although the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) is the most commonly used olfactory test, its utility was limited by the culture difference in recognition of the smells included in the test. We have developed a new modified B-SIT test for Chinese (B-SITC), and validated and compare it with B-SIT in Chinese PD patients. METHODS: From 2015 to 2018, PD patients were recruited from the Movement Disorder Clinic of Xuanwu Hospital and healthy controls were recruited from the Beijing Longitudinal Study on Aging Cohort II. The two olfactory tests were used in healthy volunteers and PD patients. RESULTS: A total of 428 subjects participated in the study: 211 healthy controls and 217 PD patients. The average B-SIT and B-SITC scores were significantly different between control and PD groups (B-SIT, 9.18 +- 1.94 vs. 6.90 +- 2.44, P = 0.0001; B-SITC, 8.60 +- 1.93 vs. 5.91 +- 2.21, P = 0.0001). The B-SITC had good sensitivity (73.1%), specificity (76.8%), positive predictive value (76.8%), and negative predictive value (73.1%) for the diagnosis of Chinese PD, and the area under the curve (AUC) value was greater for the B-SITC than for the B-SIT (0.838 vs. 0.761). CONCLUSIONS: The B-SITC is useful for the clinical assessment of olfactory function in Chinese PD patients.

32675414|t|Could Self-Consciousness Be Enhanced in Alzheimer's Disease? An Approach from Emotional Sensorial Stimulation.
32675414|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides a valuable field of research into impairment of self-consciousness (SC), because AD patients have a reduced capacity to understand their mental world, to experience and relive previous personal events, as well as to interpret thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about themselves. Several studies observed that AD patients had an altered SC, but not a complete abolition of it. Emotions are an integral part of the construction of personal identity, therefore of Self. In general, most studies on emotion in AD patients have observed that emotion is not completely abolished and it lets them better remember autobiographical events with greater emotional charge. The positive effect of autobiographical memories rich in emotional content, evoked directly/automatically by sensorial stimuli such as familiar odors or music, could be used to reestablish/reinforce the permanence and coherence of the Self in AD. We studied the research of empirical evidence supporting the power of the sensorial cues associated with emotion, which could be capable of enhancing the SC in AD. We presented the studies about "Emotional stimulations" using odor, music, or taste cues in AD. All studies have shown to have a positive impact on SC in AD patients such as odor-evoked autobiographical memories, taste/odor-evoked autobiographical memories, emotional sensorial stimulation using musical cues, and multi-sensorial stimulations using healing gardens. We found research supporting the notion that emotional sensorial stimulations can even temporarily exalt memory, affective state, and personal identity, that is, the SC in AD. The emotional sensory stimulations could be used as a tool to activate the SC in AD and hence improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.

32676768|t|Prodromal Parkinson disease in patients with idiopathic hyposmia.
32676768|a|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic hyposmia (IH) is a prodromal marker of Parkinson disease (PD). However, IH is common in the general population and only a minority will develop PD. Identification of individuals with IH at prodromal stage of PD would serve to select them to implement neuroprotective agents, when available. OBJECTIVE: To identify prodromal PD in IH patients using the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) research criteria for prodromal PD. METHODS: We applied the MDS research criteria for prodromal PD to 25 consecutive patients older than 50 years who were self-referred for smell loss and had IH, and to 18 controls. A number of risk and prodromal PD markers were assessed in all participants including REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) by video-polysomnography and nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction by DAT-SPECT. After follow-up of 4.7 +- 2.2 years, participants were re-assessed to look for incident PD. RESULTS: Prodromal PD probability was higher in patients than in controls (19.45 +- 34.9% versus 1.74 +- 4.48%; p = 0.019). Four (16%) patients met the criteria of prodromal PD surpassing 80% probability (99.8%, 99.5%, 88.3%, 86.4%). Three (12%) patients had RBD and four (16%) abnormal DAT-SPECT. At the end of follow-up, one (4%) IH patient who had RBD and baseline prodromal PD probability of 86.4% developed PD, while all controls remained disease free. CONCLUSIONS: Prodromal PD is infrequent among IH patients. MDS research criteria for prodromal PD are useful to identify a subgroup of IH patients at high risk of PD when RBD is assessed by video-polysomnography and nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency with DAT-SPECT.

32968130|t|Is there a close association of depression with either constipation or dysosmia in Parkinson's disease?
32968130|a|A possible association between depression and either the severity of constipation or dysosmia in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients was investigated in this cross-sectional study. One-hundred six patients who had the history of PD for less than 5 years were recruited. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and our patients were divided into depressive and non-depressive groups (DP: BDI-II >= 14; n = 22 and NDP: BDI-II < 14; n = 84). Olfactory dysfunction was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Constipation severity was defined by stool softener dosage and amount. Statistical analyses with one-tailed T- or chi-squared test, odds ratios (OR), and beta-coefficient were used to determine significant differences. Total scores based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were significantly higher in the DP group. A significant relationship was observed between PD patients with depression and severe constipation; PD patients with depression were more likely to present with severe constipation (OR 5.81; 95% CI 1.24-27.29, p = 0.026, adjusted for age and gender); but the significance became marginal after adjusted for age, gender and UPDRS part 3 (OR 4.46, 95% CI 0.93-21.33; p = 0.061). However, no association between olfactory dysfunction and depression was detected. There were significant positive correlations between BDI-II scores and severe constipation (beta +- SE 7.65 +- 2.02; p =  < 0.001, adjusted for age and gender; beta +- SE 7.06 +- 2.04; p = 0.001, adjusted for age, gender, and UPDRS-3). Besides, we detected a marginally significant correlation that PD patients with higher BDI-II scores tended to present more severe motor symptoms. Olfactory dysfunction seemed to be less relevant to BDI-II scores. Based on our findings, we speculate that depression may be more closely related to brainstem nuclei than to the limbic pathway.

32968939|t|Significance of hyposmia in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder.
32968939|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine if hyposmia in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) predicts short-term conversion to any alpha-synucleinopathy and declines with time. METHODS: Olfaction was tested using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-40) in 140 consecutive patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD and in 77 matched controls. Patients were followed-up during 5.6 +- 3.9 (range 0.2-13) years. Twenty-one patients underwent serial UPSIT-40 evaluations at 1-3 and 4-6 years after baseline. RESULTS: UPSIT-40 score was lower in patients than in controls (20.2 +- 6.5 vs. 28.6 +- 5.0; p < 0.001). Hyposmia (UPSIT-40 score < 19 points) occurred in 42.9% patients. Forty-three (30.7%) patients developed Parkinson disease (PD = 27), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB = 13) and multiple system atrophy (MSA = 3). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that hyposmics had higher risk than normosmics to develop a synucleinopathy at the short term (p = 0.030). UPSIT-40 score was similar between patients who developed PD and DLB (p = 0.136). Normal smell occurred in all three (100%) IRBD patients who developed MSA, 12 of 27 (44%) who developed PD, and 4 of 13 (31%) that developed DLB. Serial UPSIT-40 evaluations showed no changes with time (p = 0.518). CONCLUSION: In IRBD, hyposmia is a short-term risk for synucleinopathies but cannot distinguish underlying PD from DLB. Normosmia not only occurs in latent MSA but also in latent PD and DLB. In future IRBD neuroprotective trails, individuals at entry could be enriched for hyposmia, whereas serial evaluation of smell would not be useful to monitor the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention.

33011622|t|Smell as a clinical-marker for functional limitations in multiple sclerosis: A pilot study.
33011622|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). The questions of whether and to what degree olfactory dysfunction can serve as a clinical marker of MS disability (i.e. cognitive impairments and functional limitations) are not yet answered. The current study aimed to explore associations between olfactory function (i.e. smell identification) with cognitive capacities, functional performance and quality of life (QOL) in persons with MS. METHODS: Olfactory function was measured by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Functional ability was assessed by the Actual RealityTM (AR) task. QOL was assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54). Cognition was assessed by the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) in 23 MS patients and 15 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: MS patients had lower UPSIT scores than healthy controls. Worse UPSIT scores were associated with reduced performances on the BICAMS and AR task as well as lower MSQOL-54 scores. Specifically, UPSIT scores were related to MSQOL-54 scores independent of BICAMS composite scores, while the relationship between UPSIT score and AR performance was mediated by BICAMS composite score. CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous studies which concluded that olfactory function is impaired in MS. Furthermore, olfactory dysfunction is related to limitations in activity performance and QOL. Taken together with previous studies, olfactory function may be considered as a clinical marker related to MS disability. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these results.

33068873|t|Olfactory bulb surroundings can help to distinguish Parkinson's disease from non-parkinsonian olfactory dysfunction.
33068873|a|BACKGROUND: The olfactory bulb is one of the first regions of insult in Parkinson's disease (PD), consistent with the early onset of olfactory dysfunction. Investigations of the olfactory bulb may, therefore, help early pre-motor diagnosis. We aimed to investigate olfactory bulb and its surrounding regions in PD-related olfactory dysfunction when specifically compared to other forms of non-parkinsonian olfactory dysfunction (NPOD) and healthy controls. METHODS: We carried out MRI-based olfactory bulb volume measurements from T2-weighted imaging in scans from 15 patients diagnosed with PD, 15 patients with either post-viral or sinonasal NPOD and 15 control participants. Further, we applied a deep learning model (convolutional neural network; CNN) to scans of the olfactory bulb and its surrounding area to classify PD-related scans from NPOD-related scans. RESULTS: Compared to controls, both PD and NPOD patients had smaller olfactory bulbs, when measured manually (both p < .001) whereas no difference was found between PD and NPOD patients. In contrast, when a CNN was used to differentiate between PD patients and NPOD patients, an accuracy of 88.3% was achieved. The cortical area above the olfactory bulb which stretches around and into the olfactory sulcus appears to be a region of interest in the differentiation between PD and NPOD patients. CONCLUSION: Measures from and around the olfactory bulb in combination with the use of a deep learning model may help differentiate PD patients from patients with NPOD, which may be used to develop early diagnostic tools based on olfactory dysfunction.

33293191|t|Relationship between cognitive impairment and olfactory function among older adults with olfactory impairment.
33293191|a|OBJECTIVE: Understanding the relationships among aging, cognitive function, and olfaction may be useful for diagnosing olfactory decline in older adults. Olfactory function declines in the early stage of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Aging and cognitive impairment are associated with olfactory decline. Moreover, the assessment of hyposmia and anosmia is paramount to the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to assess the relationships among aging, cognitive function, and olfaction in patients with olfactory impairment. METHODS: This observational study included 141 patients with olfactory deterioration who presented with dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), age-related hyposmia, or postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD). The patients underwent T&T olfactometry, a self-administered odor questionnaire (SAOQ), a visual analog scale (VAS), and a Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: T&T odor recognition thresholds decreased with aging (p < 0.01) and cognitive impairment (p < 0.08). The average T&T recognition thresholds were 5.1,4.6,4.2, and 3.7 in dementia, MCI, age-related hyposmia, and PVOD, respectively. Moreover, the average differences between the detection and recognition thresholds were 3.7, 2.8, 2.3, and 2.0 in dementia, MCI, age-related hyposmia, and PVOD, respectively. Hyposmia with dementia presented the highest recognition thresholds (p < 0.05) and the largest differences between the T&T detection and recognition thresholds, compared with age-related hyposmia and PVOD (p < 0.05). Hyposmia with dementia had the highest SAOQ and VAS scores compared with the other groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The possibility of dementia should be investigated in patients with hyposmia, including those with high T&T recognition thresholds, a large difference between the T&T detection and recognition thresholds, and high SAOQ and VAS scores.

33359846|t|Odorant-induced brain activation as a function of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: A preliminary study.
33359846|a|Olfactory dysfunction consistently occurs in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), beyond the mild and gradual decline in olfactory ability found in normal aging. This dysfunction begins early in the disease course, typically before clinical diagnosis, and progresses with disease severity. While odor identification and detection deficits clearly differentiate AD from controls, there remains uncertainty as to whether these are determined by olfactory threshold. The purpose of the current preliminary fMRI study was to examine the neural correlates of olfactory processing in healthy young and old adults and compare them with AD patients. We also explored the interplay between age and disease-related psychophysical olfactory declines and odorant-induced brain activation. Results indicated AD patients had decreased odor detection task-related signal in all regions of the primary olfactory cortex, with activity in the entorhinal cortex best differentiating the groups. Moderated-mediation analyses on neuro-psychophysical relationships found that increased brain activation in the entorhinal cortex moderated the negative effect of disease-related threshold changes on olfactory detection. Therefore, even in the face of higher (worse) olfactory thresholds, older adults and AD patients compensated for this effect with increased brain activation in a primary olfactory brain region. This was the case for odor detection but not odor identification. fMRI activation induced by an olfactory detection task may eventually be useful in improving early discovery of AD and may, eventually, facilitate early treatment interventions in subjects at risk for AD.

33422806|t|Could COVID-19 anosmia and olfactory dysfunction trigger an increased risk of future dementia in patients with ApoE4?
33422806|a|The association of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with significant neurological and neuropsychiatric complications has been increasingly reported, both during the acute illness and in its aftermath. However, due to the short duration of patient follow up until now, it is not clear whether this infection will be associated with longer-term neurological and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. In particular, the question of whether COVID-19 will be associated with an increased risk and rate of future dementia remains open and subject to speculation. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients have reported sudden anosmia or other olfactory dysfunction as concurrent symptoms. The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may reach the brain via the olfactory nerve or an upper nasal trancribrial route is an interesting working hypothesis. Among the identified genetic risk factors for Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), Apo E4 is one of the strongest and most frequent. People carrying one or two copies of the e4 allele of Apo E4 have significant odor recognition deficits in comparison to those not carrying this haplotype. The hypothesis invoked in this paper is that anosmia/olfactory dysfunctions induced by SARS-CoV-2 may cause an increased a risk of future neurodegenerative dementia in ApoE4 carriers, and that this risk would be higher than in Apo E4 carriers affected by anosmia not induced by SARS-CoV-2. This would be associated with virus-induced chronic modifications in the central nervous system. It is proposed that COVID-19 patients with anosmia and no other serious symptoms should be followed up as part of specifically designed and approved studies in order to identify the early stages of dementia (especially LOAD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies), thereby improving our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in pre-cognitive stages of neurodegenerative dementia and making best use of any available therapies. This latter opportunity is unique and should not be lost.

33546569|t|Smell tests to distinguish Parkinson's disease from other neurological disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
33546569|a|Introduction: Olfactory impairment has been considered for differential diagnosis in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The authors aimed to identify the tests used to assess the olfactory function in PD patients and examine these tests' ability to distinguish them from other neurological disorders.Areas covered: Cross-sectional studies published until May 2020 comparing the olfactory function of PD patients to other neurological disorders were searched on PubMed, PsycInfo, Cinahl, and Web of Science databases using search terms related to PD, olfactory function, and assessment. Five thousand three hundred and four studies were screened, and 35 were included in the systematic review. Six smell tests that evaluated a total of 1,544 PD patients were identified. Data of 1,144 patients included in the meta-analyses revealed worse smell performance than individuals with other neurological disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and essential tremor, but not with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.Expert opinion: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test was the most used test to assess the olfactory function of PD. Smell loss was worse in PD than in some neurological disorders. The smell tests' ability in differentiating PD from other neurological disorders still deserves more attention in future studies.

33657978|t|Using the Chinese Smell Identification Test to explore olfactory function in Parkinson's disease.
33657978|a|Introduction: The Chinese Smell Identification Test (CSIT) was developed specifically for Chinese populations. This work investigated the utility of this test in detecting Parkinson's disease (PD). Olfactory dysfunction is a common non-motor symptom of PD. There are different opinions on the efficacy of drugs for anosmia in PD.Objective: To investigate the olfactory function of Chinese PD patients, verify the effectiveness of the CSIT, and further detect the effects of dopaminergic drugs on anosmia.Methods: In total, 149 PD patients were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and 149 healthy comparison participants (HCP) were recruited from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The CSIT was used for olfactory function testing in all participants.Results: CSIT scores were significantly lower in the PD group than in the HCP group (t(296) = -12.797, P < 0.001, d = 1.48). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal threshold value for the olfactory recognition test was 22.5, which had a sensitivity and specificity of 71.1% and 89.3%, respectively, for the detection of Parkinson's disease. Sex showed a significant influence on CSIT score (t = -3.552, P = 0.001), with males being more likely to develop olfactory dysfunction. We found CSIT scores of the non-medication group and the group with medication were lower than those of the HCP group, and the difference was statistically significant (t(82) = -7.116, P < 0.0167, d = 1.59; t(82) = -4.907, P < 0.0167, d = 1.10). CSIT scores of the group with medication were significantly higher than those of the non-medication group (t(41) = -3.067, P < 0.0167, d = 0.41).Conclusions: In China, the CSIT is recommended to improve the sensitivity of PD detection. The olfactory function of PD patients was improved after treatment with dopaminergic drugs.

33769989|t|Odor Identification Testing Can Assist in the Clinical Distinction Between Psychiatric Disorders and Neurological/Neurodegenerative Disorders.
33769989|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The aim was to identify whether performance on olfactory identification can distinguish neurological/neurodegenerative disorders (NNDs) from primary psychiatric disorders (PPDs). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study of inpatients assessed in Neuropsychiatry, Royal Melbourne Hospital. Data extracted from the admission records included: demographics, tobacco use, medical comorbidities, cognitive function using the Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive Assessment Tool (NUCOG), and odor identification using the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 test. The final diagnosis for patients was informed by established diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: A total 121 patients were included. Eighty-eight patients (73%) were diagnosed with neurological or neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimers dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body parkinsonian-related dementias (Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies) and other neurological causes of dementia; 33 patients (27%) were diagnosed with PPDs (including mood and psychotic disorders). Patients who scored <=8 on the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 test were more likely to have NND than PPD, even after adjustment for age, sex and tobacco use (P=0.009, adjusted odds ratios=3.85, 95% confidence interval=1.40-10.62). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that a score of <=8 differentiated NND from PPD with sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 73% (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.67, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neuropsychiatric difficulties who score 8 or less on Sniffin' Sticks are more likely to have a neurodegenerative illness. A cut-off score of 8 is potentially a "red flag" for clinicians faced with the diagnostic question of PPD versus NND.

33989761|t|COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease: Defects in neurogenesis as the potential cause of olfactory system impairments and anosmia.
33989761|a|Anosmia, a neuropathogenic condition of loss of smell, has been recognized as a key pathogenic hallmark of the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection responsible for COVID-19. While the anosmia resulting from olfactory bulb (OB) pathology is the prominent clinical characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinsonism-related symptoms in a significant portion of COVID-19 patients and survivors. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to alter the dopamine system and induce the loss of dopaminergic neurons that have been known to be the cause of PD. However, the underlying biological basis of anosmia and the potential link between COVID-19 and PD remains obscure. Ample experimental studies in rodents suggest that the occurrence of neural stem cell (NSC) mediated neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and OB is important for olfaction. Though the occurrence of neurogenesis in the human forebrain has been a subject of debate, considerable experimental evidence strongly supports the incidence of neurogenesis in the human OB in adulthood. To note, various viral infections and neuropathogenic conditions including PD with olfactory dysfunctions have been characterized by impaired neurogenesis in OB and OE. Therefore, this article describes and examines the recent reports on SARS-CoV-2 mediated OB dysfunctions and defects in the dopaminergic system responsible for PD. Further, the article emphasizes that COVID-19 and PD associated anosmia could result from the regenerative failure in the replenishment of the dopaminergic neurons in OB and olfactory sensory neurons in OE.

34117799|t|Sweet or Bland Dreams? Taste Loss in Isolated REM-Sleep Behavior Disorder and Parkinson's Disease.
34117799|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia and isolated REM sleep behavior disorder are well-established features of prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether taste loss (reported in PD and possibly suggesting brain stem involvement) is present at the isolated REM sleep behavior disorder stage. METHODS: We assessed taste function using the Taste Strip Test (evaluating 4 concentrations of bitter, sweet, sour, and salty) in 44 participants with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder, 19 with PD, and 29 controls. All participants underwent video-polysomnography, standardized questionnaires, and clinical examination, including olfactory assessment. RESULTS: Participants with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder and PD had lower taste scores than controls. There was no difference between isolated REM sleep behavior disorder and PD cohorts, nor was there any correlation between taste and olfaction, age, disease duration, cognition, or autonomic function. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of taste impairment in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder that is independent of olfactory dysfunction and comparable to participants with PD.   2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

34319482|t|Systematic review and meta-analysis of Sniffin Sticks Test performance in Parkinson's disease patients in different countries.
34319482|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfaction impairment occurs in about 90% of patients with Parkinson's disease. The Sniffin Sticks Test is a widely used instrument to measure olfactory performance and is divided into three subtests that assess olfactory threshold, discrimination and identification. However, cultural and socioeconomic differences can influence test performance. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existent data about Sniffin Sticks Test performance of Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls in different countries and investigated if there are other cofactors which could influence the olfactory test results. A subgroup analysis by country was performed as well as a meta-regression using age, gender and air pollution as covariates. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty studies were found and 66 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Parkinson's disease patients showed significantly lower scores on the Sniffin Sticks Test and all its subtests than healthy controls. Overall, the heterogeneity among studies was moderate to high as well as the intra-country heterogeneity. The subgroup analysis, stratifying by country, maintained a high residual heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The meta-regression showed a significant correlation with age and air pollution in a few subtests. A high heterogeneity was found among studies which was not significantly decreased after subgroup analysis by country. This fact signalizes that maybe cultural influence has a small impact on the Sniffin Sticks Test results. Age and air pollution have influence in a few olfactory subtests.

34984501|t|Metabolic correlates of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD) do not overlap.
34984501|a|PURPOSE: Hyposmia is a common feature of COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD). As parkinsonism has been reported after COVID-19, a link has been hypothesized between SARS-CoV2 infection and PD. We aimed to evaluate brain metabolic correlates of isolated persistent hyposmia after mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and to compare them with metabolic signature of hyposmia in drug-naive PD patients. METHODS: Forty-four patients who experienced hyposmia after SARS-COV2 infection underwent brain [18F]-FDG PET in the first 6 months after recovery. Olfaction was assessed by means of the 16-item "Sniffin' Sticks" test and patients were classified as with or without persistent hyposmia (COVID-hyposmia and COVID-no-hyposmia respectively). Brain [18F]-FDG PET of post-COVID subgroups were compared in SPM12. COVID-hyposmia patients were also compared with eighty-two drug-naive PD patients with hyposmia. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify correlations between olfactory test scores and brain metabolism in patients' subgroups. RESULTS: COVID-hyposmia patients (n = 21) exhibited significant hypometabolism in the bilateral gyrus rectus and orbitofrontal cortex with respect to COVID-non-hyposmia (n = 23) (p < 0.002) and in middle and superior temporal gyri, medial/middle frontal gyri, and right insula with respect to PD-hyposmia (p < 0.012). With respect to COVID-hyposmia, PD-hyposmia patients showed hypometabolism in inferior/middle occipital gyri and cuneus bilaterally. Olfactory test scores were directly correlated with metabolism in bilateral rectus and medial frontal gyri and in the right middle temporal and anterior cingulate gyri in COVID-hyposmia patients (p < 0.006) and with bilateral cuneus/precuneus and left lateral occipital cortex in PD-hyposmia patients (p < 0.004). CONCLUSION: Metabolic signature of persistent hyposmia after COVID-19 encompasses cortical regions involved in olfactory perception and does not overlap metabolic correlates of hyposmia in PD.

35986984|t|Neuronal network-based biomimetic chip for long-term detection of olfactory dysfunction model in early-stage Alzheimer's disease.
35986984|a|Olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom of neurodegenerative disease. Amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs), the pathologic protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been confirmed to be firstly deposited in olfactory bulb (OB), causing smell to malfunction. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying pathogenic nature of AbetaOs-induced olfactory neuronal degeneration in AD are not completely realized. Here, an early-stage olfactory dysfunction pathological model of AD in vitro based on biomimetic OB neuronal network chip was established for dynamic multi-site detection of neuronal electrical activity and network connection. We found both spike firing and correlation of overall neuronal network change regularly displayed gradually active state and then rapidly decay state after AbetaOs induction. Moreover, MK-801 and memantine were administrated at early-stage to detect alteration of OB neurons simulating nasal administration for AD treatment, which showed an almost recovery through the intermittent firing pattern. Together, this neuronal network-on-chip has revealed synaptic impairment and network neurodegeneration of olfactory dysfunction in AD, providing potential mechanisms information for early-stage progressive olfactory amyloidogenic pathology.

36183864|t|REM sleep behavior and olfactory dysfunction: Enhancing the utility and translation of animal models in the search for precision medicines for Parkinson's disease.
36183864|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that belongs to the family of synucleiopathies, varying according to age, symptoms and progression. The hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) protein in neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells. Over the past decades, the diagnosis and treatment of PD had a view centred on motoric endpoint and deficits in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and consequently animal models of PD with predominantly motor behavior deficits have been used to study the disease. However, clinical trials have failed to translate results from animal models into successful treatments. PD as a multisystem disorder therefore requires additional assessment of early non-motor symptoms. Braak's staging revealed early alpha-Syn pathology in the pontine brainstem and olfactory circuits controlling rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and olfaction, respectively. Recent converging evidence from multicenter clinical trials points to RBD as the most important functional risk marker for prodromal PD and conducting neuroprotective therapeutic trials in RBD-enriched cohorts has been recommended. Animal models of RBD and olfactory dysfunction may help bridge the translational research gap in precision drug discovery for PD.

36240083|t|Olfactory Dysfunction and Incidence of Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome: A Prospective Clinical-Pathologic Study.
36240083|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between olfactory dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a predementia syndrome characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait that is associated with risk for AD and other dementias. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study to examine if baseline olfactory function was associated with risk of incident MCR in 1,119 adults aged 60 and older (75.1% female). The association between performance on the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) and incident MCR risk was computed using Cox models and reported as Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for demographic, comorbidity, and cognitive factors. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between postmortem AD pathology as well as non-AD pathology and olfactory function at the time of MCR diagnosis using linear regression models adjusted for sex, education, age at death, and time from diagnosis to death. RESULTS: There were 544 (48.6%) incident cases of MCR over a median follow-up of 3.94 years. Lower BSIT scores (poor olfaction) at baseline were associated with an increased risk of incident MCR (HR for a 1-point increase in BSIT score, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96) in fully adjusted models. Those with hyposmia (scores of <=8 on the BSIT) at baseline (26.6%) were at increased risk of MCR (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.74) compared to those with normal olfactory function. A composite measure of global AD pathology as well as presence of Lewy body pathology were both inversely and independently associated with BSIT scores at the time of incident MCR diagnosis (n=118). tau tangle density, a specific component of AD pathology, was inversely associated with olfactory function and the correlation remained after controlling for mild cognitive impairment syndrome as well as presence of Lewy body pathology. DISCUSSION: The results provide evidence that olfactory dysfunction precedes MCR incidence and is related to Alzheimer pathology; providing a clinical approach to risk stratify as well as subtype MCR.

36806051|t|The Association Between Neurocognitive Disorders and Gustatory Dysfunction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
36806051|a|Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction have been reported in mild and major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), with variable results. While olfactory dysfunction has been consistently explored, reports on gustatory alterations are limited. We systematically reviewed case-control studies evaluating gustatory function in NCDs with various etiologies and different neuropathology. Eighteen studies were included in the systematic review, and eight were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies were on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Pooled analyses showed worse global taste threshold and identification (sour in particular) scores in AD than controls and worse global, sweet, and sour scores in AD compared to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). PD with MCI showed worse global, sweet, salty, and sour scores than controls and cognitively unimpaired PD. Taste dysfunction was differentially associated with the severity of cognitive deficits. Gustatory dysfunction may represent a potential cross-disease chemosensory biomarker of NCD. Whether gustatory alterations may be a pre-clinical biomarker of NCD requires further studies.

37355894|t|Odor Discrimination as a Marker of Early Alzheimer's Disease.
37355894|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, olfactory tests are rarely performed in clinical practice because their diagnostic efficacy in detecting early AD is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate odor discrimination in patients with early AD and the efficacy of olfactory discrimination tests in differentiating these patients from subjects with normal cognition (CN). METHODS: Thirty patients each with mild dementia due to AD (MD-AD) and mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD) and 30 older subjects with CN were enrolled. All participants underwent cognitive examinations (CDR, MMSE, ADAS-Cog 13, and verbal fluency) and odor discrimination tests (Sniffin' Sticks test, Burghart , Germany). RESULTS: The MD-AD group achieved significantly worse scores on the olfactory discrimination test than the MCI-AD group, and the MCI-AD group achieved significantly worse results than the CN group (p < 0.05). A cut-off score of<=10 had a diagnostic accuracy of 94.44% (95% CI, 87.51-98.17%) in differentiating patients with MCI-AD/MD-AD from subjects with CN and of 91.67% (95% CI, 81.61-97.24%) in differentiating those with MCI-AD from subjects with CN. Our multinomial logistic regression model with demographic data and ADAS-Cog 13 scores as predictor variables correctly classified 82.2% of the cases (CN, 93.3%; MC-AD, 70%; MD-AD, 83.3%); on adding the olfactory discrimination score to the model, the percentage increased to 92.2% (CN, 96.7%; MCI-AD, 86.7%; MD-AD, 93.3%). CONCLUSION: Odor discrimination is impaired in cases of early AD and continues to deteriorate as the disease progresses. The olfactory discrimination test showed good diagnostic efficacy in detecting early AD.

37424476|t|Serum Uric Acid as a Putative Biomarker in Prodromal Parkinson's Disease: Longitudinal Data from the PPMI Study.
37424476|a|BACKGROUND: The role of blood uric acid as a biomarker in symptomatic motor PD has been increasingly established in the literature. OBJECTIVE: Our present study assessed the role of serum uric acid as a putative biomarker in a prodromal PD cohort [REM Sleep Behavior disorder (RBD) and Hyposmia] followed longitudinally. METHODS: Longitudinal 5-year serum uric acid measurement data of 39 RBD patients and 26 Hyposmia patients with an abnormal DATSCAN imaging were downloaded from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. These cohorts were compared with 423 de novo PD patients and 196 healthy controls enrolled in the same study. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and concomitant disorders (hypertension/gout), baseline and longitudinal serum uric acid levels were higher in the RBD subgroup as compared to the established PD cohort (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001). (Baseline RBD 6.07+-1.6 vs. Baseline PD 5.35+-1.3 mg/dL and Year-5 RBD 5.7+-1.3 vs. Year-5 PD 5.26+-1.33). This was also true for longitudinal measurements in the Hyposmic subgroup (p = 0.008) (Baseline Hyposmic 5.7+-1.6 vs. PD 5.35+-1.3 mg/dL and Year-5 Hyposmic 5.58+-1.6 vs. PD 5.26+-1.33). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that serum uric acid levels are higher in prodromal PD subjects with ongoing dopaminergic degeneration compared to those with manifest PD. These data indicate that the well-established decrease in the levels of serum uric acid occurs with the transition from prodromal to clinical PD. Whether the higher levels of serum uric acid observed in prodromal PD may provide protection against conversion to full-blown clinical PD will require further study.

37695364|t|The first quick olfactory test specific for Alzheimer's disease and French culture.
37695364|a|PURPOSE: Olfactory identification disorder is considered a promising early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The QUICK TODA2 can be used as a short olfactory screening tool specific for French AD patients. The selection of AD specific odorants and the design of this screening were the main objectives of this twofold study. METHODS: In study 1, the TODA2 olfactory test was administered to 43 mild-AD patients and 45 healthy controls (HC) in five memory centres in France. The selection of AD specific odorants was based on the differences in the proportion of correct answers and in the threshold means between AD and HC groups. In study 2, another set of 19 mild-AD patient were included at the memory centre of Nice Hospital. All participants completed the olfactory assessment pipeline including the QUICK TODA2, TODA2 and Sniffin' Sticks Identification sub-Test (SST-i). The individual scores of the three tests were correlated. RESULTS: In study 1, ten TODA2 odorants could significantly differentiate AD participants from controls. We selected the six most AD-sensitive items to design the QUICK TODA2. In study 2, we reported strong significant correlations between QUICK TODA2 and TODA2 (rho(17) = 0.68, p = 0.001**), SST-i and QUICK TODA2 (rho(17) = 0.65, p = 0.002**), SST-i and TODA2 (rho(17) = 0.57, p = 0.01*). CONCLUSION:  QUICK TODA2 is a 5-min non-invasive olfactory AD screening tool dedicated to French culture. Its results converge with those of longer, validated olfactory tests. It could be used as a quick screening tool in the general daily practice before an extensive assessment in memory centres.

37940708|t|Correlation of olfactory function factors with cardiac sympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease.
37940708|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia is a common nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and reportedly associated with dysautonomia in PD. The smell identification test for measuring olfactory function consists of multiple items to discriminate specific scents. In the present study, factor analysis of the smell identification test was performed, and the correlation of extracted factors with cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) in patients with PD was investigated. METHODS: The present study included 183 early PD patients who underwent the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT) and 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy. Factor analysis of 12 items on the CC-SIT was performed using the computed correlation matrix for the binary items, and five smell factors were extracted. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the correlation of olfactory function with late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio of 123I-MIBG uptake. RESULTS: The mean CC-SIT score was 6.1 +- 2.6, and 133 patients (72.7%) had CSD. The CC-SIT score and five smell factors were not associated with dopamine transporter uptake or cognitive functions. However, the CC-SIT score significantly correlated with age (P < 0.001) and late H/M ratio (P < 0.001). Factors 1 and 5 showed an increasing trend with larger H/M ratio, although it was not statistically significant (beta = 0.203, P = 0.085 and beta = 0.230, P = 0.085, respectively). Factor 5 significantly correlated with the H/M ratio in PD patients with CSD (beta = 0.676, P = 0.036). DISCUSSION: The results showed olfactory dysfunction to be selectively associated with cardiac sympathetic burden in PD. The correlation of certain factors with CSD indicates the possibility of selective hyposmia in PD patients.

37943054|t|Association of gustatory dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37943054|a|BACKGROUND: Chemosensory dysfunction has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with olfaction, gustatory dysfunction in AD has not been evaluated in depth. We reviewed previously published studies regarding gustatory dysfunction in patients with AD compared with healthy controls. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed databases covering publications from January 2000 to February 2023. The search was performed using the keyword &quot;Alzheimer* AND (gustatory OR taste OR gustation).&quot; Only studies that performed gustatory function testing and compared the results between patients with AD and healthy controls were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twelve articles were finally included, and various gustatory tests including taste strips, the taste disk test, taste solutions, and subjective questionnaires were applied. Overall gustatory function based on the taste strip test was significantly decreased in patients with AD compared with controls in two out of three papers. The overall gustatory function of patients with AD was significantly decreased in all studies based on the taste disk and taste solution tests. We also found that the sweet taste test showed low heterogeneity across all the included studies, and there was low publication bias. In studies using subjective questionnaires, gustatory function was not significantly different between patients with AD and healthy controls in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these studies, gustatory dysfunction diagnosed by gustatory function testing was closely related to AD. However, the results of subjective questionnaires were not significantly different between patients with AD and healthy controls in the current meta-analysis. As the number of studies and enrolled subjects was limited and unified gustatory function testing was lacking, further studies are needed to confirm this relationship.

37962784|t|Proprioceptive and olfactory deficits in individuals with Parkinson disease and mild cognitive impairment.
37962784|a|BACKGROUND: Individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) disease often present with perceptual impairments at an early clinical stage. Therefore, early identification and quantification of these impairments could facilitate diagnosis and early intervention. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare proprioceptive and olfactory sensitivities in individuals diagnosed with PD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Proprioception in the forearm and olfactory function were measured in neurotypical older adults, individuals with PD, and individuals with MCI. Position and passive motion senses were assessed using a passive motion apparatus. The traditional Chinese version of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT-TC) and the smell threshold test (STT) were used to identify and discriminate smell, respectively. RESULTS: Position sense threshold between the groups differed significantly (p < 0.001), with the PD (p < 0.001) and MCI (p = 0.004) groups showing significantly higher than the control group. The control group had significantly higher mean UPSIT-TC scores than the PD (p < 0.001) and MCI (p = 0.006) groups. The control group had a significantly lower mean STT threshold than the PD and MCI groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). UPSIT-TC scores significantly correlated with disease progression in PD (r = - 0.50, p = 0.008) and MCI (r = 0.44, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Proprioceptive and olfactory sensitivities were reduced in individuals with PD and MCI, and these deficits were related to disease severity. These findings support previous findings indicating that perceptual loss may be a potential biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases.

38401301|t|Clinical characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease with reduced 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake in the major salivary glands and heart.
38401301|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows cardiac sympathetic denervation (SD) in 123I-metaiodobezylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. Recently, SD in the major salivary glands (MSG-SD) was introduced as a possible radiological feature of PD. OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinical characteristics of patients with PD with reduced MSG and cardiac MIBG uptake (dual-SD) compared with those with reduced MSG or cardiac MIBG uptake only (single-SD). METHODS: We recruited 90 patients with PD and 30 controls and evaluated their non-motor (e.g., hyposmia, autonomic dysfunction) and motor (e.g., Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) features. We also assessed MIBG uptake in the MSG and heart using a quantitative semi-automatic method, and compared MIBG uptakes between PD and controls. We set cut-off values for optimal sensitivity and specificity, and compared the clinical characteristics of patients with PD between dual- and single-SD groups. RESULTS: MSG and cardiac MIBG uptakes were significantly reduced in PD. Sixty-one patients had dual-SD, 25 had single-SD, and four had non-SD. In patients with PD with normal cardiac SD, 76.5% (13/17) of whom showed abnormalities only in MSG-SD. When clinical characteristics were compared between the dual-SD and single-/non-SD groups, patients in the dual-SD group were older and had more severe hyposmia and autonomic dysfunction, except motor features. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age as an important confounder. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PD with dual-SD have more severe non-motor features than other patients. Autonomic dysfunction might progress independently from dopaminergic degeneration. Furthermore, our findings indicate that aging is a crucial factor in PD progression.

38522243|t|Diagnostic value of vietnamese smell identification test in Parkinson's disease.
38522243|a|INTRODUCTION: The Vietnamese Smell Identification Test (VSIT) has been validated in determining olfactory dysfunction in the Vietnamese population; however, its value in diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been established. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted at University Medical Center HCMC, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The study sample included non-demented PD patients and healthy controls (HC) who were gender- and age-matched. All participants were evaluated for odor identification ability using the VSIT and the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). RESULTS: A total of 218 HCs and 218 PD patients participated in the study. The median VSIT and BSIT scores were significantly different between PD and HC groups (VSIT, 5 (3) vs. 9 (2), P < 0.0001; BSIT, 6 (3) vs 8 (2), P < 0.0001). Using the cut-off of <8 for correct answers out of 12 odorants, the VSIT had higher sensitivity (84.4%) and specificity (86.2%) than those of the BSIT (sensitivity of 81.7% and specificity of 69.3%) for the diagnosis of PD. The area under the curve (AUC) value was greater for the VSIT than for the BSIT (0.909 vs 0.818). The smell identification scores were not significantly correlated with disease duration, disease severity, or LEDD (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The VSIT can be a valuable ancillary tool for supporting the diagnosis of PD in Vietnam. Olfactory dysfunction in PD was unrelated to the disease duration and severity. The VSIT can be applied to improve the accuracy of clinical PD diagnosis.

38669560|t|Cognition and Other Non-Motor Symptoms in an At-Risk Cohort for Parkinson's Disease Defined by REM-Sleep Behavior Disorder and Hyposmia.
38669560|a|Background: REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other non-motor symptoms such as hyposmia were proposed by the Movement Disorder Society as research criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease (P-PD). Global cognitive deficit was later added. Objective: To compare non-motor symptoms, focusing on cognition, between a P-PD group and a matched control group. Methods: In this cross-sectional, case-control study, in a first set of analyses, we performed extensive cognitive testing on people with (n = 76) and a control group without (n = 195) probable RBD and hyposmia. Furthermore, we assessed motor and non-motor symptoms related to Parkinson's Disease (PD). After propensity score matching, we compared 62 P-PD with 62 age- and sex-matched controls. In addition, we performed regression analyses on the total sample (n = 271). In a second set of analyses, we used, a.o., the CUPRO to evaluate retrograde procedural memory and visuo-constructive functions. Results: People with P-PD showed significantly poorer performances in global cognition, visuo-constructive and executive functions, mainly in mental flexibility (p < 0.001; p = 0.004; p = 0.003), despite similar educational levels (p = 0.415). We observed significantly more motor and non-motor symptoms (p < 0.001; p = 0.004), higher scores for depression (p = 0.004) and apathy (p < 0.001) as well as lower quality of life (p < 0.001) in P-PD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that global cognitive, executive, and visuo-constructive deficits define the P-PD group. In addition, depression, apathy, and lower quality of life were more prevalent in P-PD. If replicated in other samples, executive and visuo-constructive deficits should be considered in non-motor P-PD. Determining specific patterns will support early recognition of PD, secondary prevention of complications and the development of neuroprotective treatments.

38806701|t|Parkinson's disease with hyposmia and dysautonomia: does it represent a distinct subtype?
38806701|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Olfactory dysfunction or dysautonomia is one of the earliest prodromal nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to investigate whether PD patients with dysautonomia and hyposmia at the de novo stage present different prognoses regarding PD dementia (PDD) conversion, motor complication development, and change in levodopa-equivalent doses (LED). METHODS: In this retrograde cohort study, we included 105 patients with newly diagnosed PD patients who underwent cross-cultural smell identification test (CC-SIT), autonomic function tests (AFT), and dopamine transporter (DAT) scan at the de novo stage. PD patients were divided into Hyposmia + /Dysautonomia + (H + /D +) and Hyposmia - /Dysautonomia - (H - /D -) groups depending on the result of AFT and CC-SIT. Baseline clinical, cognitive, imaging characteristics, longitudinal risks of PDD development and motor complication occurrence, and longitudinal LED changes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: When compared with the H - /D - group, the H + /D + group showed lower standardized uptake value ratios in all subregions, lower asymmetry index, and steeper ventral - dorsal gradient in the DAT scan. The H + /D + group exhibited poorer performance in frontal/executive function and a higher risk of PDD development. The risk of motor complications including levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and freezing of gait, was comparable between the two groups. The analysis of longitudinal changes in LED using a linear mixed model showed that the increase of LED in the H + /D + group was more rapid. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PD patients with dysautonomia and hyposmia at the de novo stage show a higher risk of PD dementia conversion and rapid progression of motor symptoms.

39298281|t|Subjective cognitive and olfactory impairments predict different prospective dementia outcomes.
39298281|a|Self-reported measures emerge as potential indicators for early detection of dementia and mortality. We investigated the predictive value of different self-reported measures, including subjective cognitive decline (SCD), subjective olfactory impairment (SOI), subjective taste impairment (STI) and self-reported poor health (SPH), in order to determine the risk of progressing to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia, Parkinson's Disease (PD) dementia or any-other-cause dementia. A total of 6028 cognitively unimpaired individuals from the 8th-wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) were included as baseline sample, and 5297 individuals from the 9th-wave were included as two-year follow-up sample. Self-rated measures were assessed using questions from the ELSA structured interview. Three logistic regression models were fitted to predict different the dementia outcomes. SCD based on memory complaints (OR = 11.145; p < 0.001), and older age (OR = 1.108, p < 0.001) significantly predicted the progression to AD dementia at follow-up. SOI (OR = 7.440; p <0.001) and older age (OR = 1.065, p = 0.035) significantly predicted the progression to PD dementia at follow-up. Furthermore, SCD based on memory complaints (OR = 4.448; p < 0.001) jointly with complaints in other (non-memory) mental abilities (OR = 6.662; p < 0.001), and older age (OR = 1.147, p < 0.001) significantly predicted the progression to dementia of any other cause. Different types of complaints are specifically associated with different dementia outcomes. Our study demonstrates that self-reported measures are a useful and accessible tool when screening for individuals at risk of dementia in the general population.

1992839|t|The nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
1992839|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the specific nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies had noted impaired odor identification, but there was no unanimity about the presence of odor detection deficits. METHOD: Odor identification was tested in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 57 elderly control subjects by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Odor detection was assessed in 46 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 40 control subjects by using a forced-choice threshold test with geraniol as the odorant. RESULTS: Significant deficits in olfactory identification were present in subjects who were in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment, and these deficits increased as Alzheimer's disease progressed. There was some overlap in individual smell identification test scores between cognitively impaired patients and normal elderly subjects. On the other hand, odor detection deficits did not appear until Alzheimer's disease was relatively advanced. Smell identification test scores were correlated with Mini-Mental State scores, but geraniol detection was not. CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease and may be more influenced by cognitive status than is acuity of odor detection, which is not altered until later in the disorder. The pattern of hyposmia in Alzheimer's disease suggests that the disorder may not "begin in the nose," as has been theorized previously. Further refinement of olfactory testing may be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of early dementia.

9201769|t|Olfactory evoked potentials in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and anosmic patients.
9201769|a|Olfactory evoked potential (OEP) recordings were undertaken using amyl acetate stimulation in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease, nine patients with Alzheimer's disease, seven patients with olfactory dysfunction with no other neurological disorder, and 17 control subjects. In order to eliminate the somatosensory factor from the combined somatosensory and olfactory components produced by amyl acetate stimulation, we substracted the potentials using odorless air from those using amyl acetate. In normal subjects, three components were observed, the mean latencies of which were 309 +/- 46, 484 +/- 61 and 710 +/- 55 ms. In all subjects with anosmia (n = 7), no responses were observed. In the patients with Alzheimer's disease, the components were fewer despite having no olfactory dysfunction. In the 20 patients with Parkinson's disease, eight [corrected] patients showed no components, seven patients showed one component and four [corrected] patients showed two components. The components rarely were detected in spite of whether the patients had olfactory dysfunction or not. Olfactory evoked potentials are useful in detecting olfactory dysfunction and the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

9547468|t|Olfactory dysfunction discriminates Alzheimer's dementia from major depression.
9547468|a|This study tested the hypothesis that olfactory dysfunction could discriminate between groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease and major depression. Forty patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's disease and for major depression (20 per group) underwent assessment with the Pocket Smell Test (PST), a three-item screening measure of cranial nerve I function. A PST score of < or = 1 (1 or 0 correct) discriminated between the groups with a hit rate of 90% (sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 100%). Olfactory assessment may be a useful adjunctive screening measure in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from depression in elderly patients.

10336141|t|Loss of olfactory function in dementing disease.
10336141|a|Alzheimer's (AD) patients show neuropathological changes in areas of the brain central to olfactory processing, suggesting the theoretical importance and potential diagnostic utility of investigating functional changes in olfaction in these patients. Persons with Down's Syndrome who live to the fourth decade develop neuropathological changes in the brain similar to those found in AD. A series of investigations have been conducted to assess olfaction function in both patients with Alzheimer's disease and persons with Down's Syndrome. Functional testing included olfactory threshold, odor identification, odor similarity judgements, odor recognition memory, odor recall, odor fluency. Both Alzheimer's patients and persons with Down's Syndrome showed significant impairment in olfactory function, with some measures showing more impairment than others in the early stages of the disease process. Longitudinal investigation of several of the measures indicated decreased function over time consonant with falling DRS scores. Normal controls who tested positive for the APOE4 allele showed impaired odor identification compared to those who were allele negative. Patients with Huntington's Disease showed olfactory functional impairments, although the degree of impairment differed from the cortical dementias for some of these tasks. The sensitivity and specificity of these assessments will be discussed in relation to analogous assessments in other sensory modalities.

10434367|t|[Smell and taste disorders].
10434367|a|Disorders of the chemical senses are frequent. They can severely affect our lives. Appropriate testing is needed to determine the nature of the patient's complaints. Because many chemosensory disorders are secondary to a wide variety of diseases, olfactory or gustatory complaints may help in establishing certain differential diagnoses, e.g. in Alzheimer's disease. In turn, treatment of the underlying diseases may restore chemosensory function in these patients. Future developments appear possible in light of the availability of standardised tools for the assessment of chemosensory dysfunction.

11398013|t|[Taste impairment in Alzheimer's disease].
11398013|a|We conducted a study of Alzheimer's disease focusing on taste impairment to determine at which step of gustatory information processing (discriminative or perceptive, gnosic or associative, gustatory-verbal) possible perturbations might be located. We used various foods found in a normal diet. Twenty patients and a matched control group participated in this study. The patients were divided into two subgroups according to disease severity (mild, moderate or severe). The study showed that patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibited an impairment at all three levels of gustatory information processing. Impairment of discriminative and gustatory-verbal stages was more obvious in the group of patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. Our study also showed that the gustatory deficiency can be described as an associative agnosia in the mild stage of Alzheimer's disease. This concept is in line with the notion of a dissociation between preservation of olfactory and gustatory thresholds and an alteration in odor identification in patients with mild stage Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that the alteration is central rather than peripheral. Our findings suggest that an alteration of the associative level of gustatory information processing can be found in Alzheimer's disease early stage.

11959402|t|Taste, smell and neuropsychological performance of individuals at familial risk for Alzheimer's disease.
11959402|a|The purpose of the study was to determine whether there are chemosensory and neuropsychological changes that predate the onset of Alzheimer's disease in individuals at enhanced risk of developing the condition. To study this question, a unique sample of individuals (n = 33) was studied who were genetically at-risk for AD by virtue of documented multigenerational evidence of the disease (so-called multiplex families). The performance of at-risk individuals was evaluated on various smell, taste, and neuropsychological measures at baseline and 18 months later. Their performance was compared to a control group (n = 32) that was matched in age, gender, education, and race. At baseline the at-risk group performed worse than the control group on the chemosensory measures of phenethyl alcohol smell detection, smell memory, and taste memory, and on a memory measure involving recall of narrative information (Logical Memory I from the Wechsler Memory Scale- Revised). Across both sessions, the at-risk group had lower smell memory scores than the control group. At-risk status was not significantly associated with APOE status. The results of this and other studies suggest that individuals who are genetically at risk for developing AD may perform more poorly on memory and smell measures compared to those not at risk. This effect may be separate from one known genetic risk factor of AD, APOE, and supports that multiple genes are likely responsible for the disease and its associated memory and other neurocognitive symptoms.

12383407|t|Olfactory function in Parkinsonian syndromes.
12383407|a|The study aimed to compare olfactory function in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and nonidiopathic Parkinson's syndrome (PS). At their first visit 50 PS patients (age 38-80 years) received testing for odor threshold, olfactory discrimination and identification. All patients underwent extensive neurological diagnostics including PET scans. Patients were followed up for 6-12 months. Most of IPD patients were functionally anosmic (n=19), the remaining IPD patients had severe/moderate hyposmia (n=18). PS patients diagnosed with multiple system atrophy had less severe olfactory deficits (7 hyposmia, 1 normosmia). With the exception of 1 hyposmic patient, other PS patients had no olfactory deficits (progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, psychogenic PS, essential tremor). This study added to previous findings: (1) there was no major difference betwesen olfactory function in IPD subtypes; (2) all olfactory tests differentiated IPD from nonIPD. These data suggest that olfactory probes improve the diagnostic armamentarium in IPD.

15851853|t|Olfactory involvement in aging and Alzheimer's disease: an autopsy study.
15851853|a|Olfactory dysfunction and tau pathology in the olfactory bulb increase with the severity of Alzheimer's disease. We report data of a postmortem study in the aged. 130 autopsy cases (81 female, 49 male, aged 61-102, mean 82.48 +/- 4.35 SD) years, underwent a standardized neuropathological assessment with immunohistochemical study of tau pathology in the olfactory bulb and nerve and of Alzheimer's disease using established criteria including Braak staging. All cases of definite Alzheimer's disease (Braak stages 5 and 6) (n = 40) showed large numbers of neuropil threads and neurofibrillary tangles, with amyloid deposits in 32.5% and neuritic plaques in one single case in the olfactory system. Braak stage 4 (n = 27) was associated with mild to moderate tau pathology in 85.2%, and amyloid plaques in 1.1%, Braak stage 3 (n = 28) with olfactory tau lesions in 37.0% and amyloid deposits in one single case, Braak stages 3 and 4 with olfactory tau lesions in 61.1%. Braak stage 2 (n = 15) showed olfactory tau pathology in 31.2%, whereas Braak stages 0 and 1 (n = 15) were all negative. The olfactory system tau score showed highly significant correlations with neuritic Braak stages in the brain, while both scores showed significant but low correlations with age. These data confirm previous studies demonstrating abundant tau pathology in the olfactory system in all definite Alzheimer's disease cases, in two-thirds of limbic Alzheimer's disease, and in almost one-third of non-demented elderly persons with Braak stage 2. There are strong correlations between tau pathology in the olfactory and limbic systems, both with similar increase in severity. Clinical dementia correlated with both Braak and olfactory system tau scores. Since the involvement of both systems is associated with a high risk of cognitive decline, future studies should validate the sensitivity of olfactory mucosa biopsies in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

16170073|t|Anosmia is very common in the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease.
16170073|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory abnormalities are reported in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Anosmia appears to be common in dementia with Lewy bodies but not in pure Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anosmia improves discrimination between the Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease and "pure" Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: 106 cases of necropsy confirmed pure Alzheimer's disease (n = 89) or LBV (n = 17) were reviewed. All had received butanol odour threshold testing. Anosmia was defined as a score < or = 1.0 on a 0-9 point scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to model potential predictors (for example, parkinsonism, smoking, hallucinations) of neuropathological diagnosis and anosmia. RESULTS: LBV cases had an increased prevalence of anosmia (65%) compared with Alzheimer's disease (23%; odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, p = 0.00045), or normal elderly people (6.7%). Within the dementia cases, the negative predictive value (92%) and specificity (78%) of anosmia were both good; sensitivity for detecting LBV was 65%, but the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 35%. Logistic regression models showed anosmia (OR = 5.4, p = 0.005) and visual hallucinations (OR = 7.3, p = 0.007) were strong independent predictors of Lewy body pathology. When anosmia was added as a core feature to consensus diagnostic criteria for probable Lewy body dementia, five additional cases of LBV were detected (29% increased sensitivity), but with four additional false positives (1% increased discrimination, 4% decreased specificity, 33% decreased PPV). CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia is very common in LBV. Adding anosmia as a core feature improved sensitivity for detecting LBV, but did not improve discrimination between Alzheimer's disease and LBV owing to a concomitant increase in false positives.

17207898|t|Olfaction in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
17207898|a|Understanding of olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains limited. In particular, it is not known how early in the course of the disease olfactory deficits occur, and whether they are restricted to identification or involve other aspects of olfaction. We studied olfactory (odor detection thresholds, quality discrimination, and identification) and cognitive (attention, reasoning, memory, naming and fluency) functioning in patients with AD, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and in normal elderly control (NEC) participants. MCI patients were impaired in olfactory sensitivity and identification, while a discrimination deficit was accounted for by abnormal thresholds. AD patients were impaired in all three domains, and were worse than the MCI group. Odor discrimination (OD) and identification performance correlated more prominently than detection thresholds with performance on neuropsychological tests. We concluded that deficits in olfactory detection thresholds and identification occur early in AD, before clinical symptoms are fully developed, and decline further over the course of the disease. High detection thresholds, together with impaired identification, may be useful as an early indicator of AD.

17259864|t|Olfaction and neurodegeneration in HD.
17259864|a|Olfactory deficits are present in many neurodegenerative diseases. It is not known, however, whether the olfactory deterioration is caused by a common neural deficit, or whether it is unique to each disease. We report here the effect of degeneration of different brain structures on olfactory impairment in Huntington's disease as determined by voxel-based morphometric analysis. The structures with the greatest effect on the olfactory deficit were the entorhinal cortex, the thalamus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the caudate nucleus. Although various neuroimaging studies have shown previously that the caudate nucleus is involved in olfaction, this is the first demonstration that it is related to an olfactory dysfunction in a neurodegenerative disease. The results are discussed in relation to other neurodegenerative diseases.

17715794|t|A review of cognitive impairments in dementia with Lewy bodies relative to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease with dementia.
17715794|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has recently been identified as a separate disease but diagnosis can be difficult, in particular the differentiation from related dementias of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Careful cognitive assessment may aid differential diagnosis between these different types of dementia and can provide theoretical insight into the nature of the underlying impairments. Recent reviews on DLB have primarily dealt with medical issues of clinical diagnostic criteria, pathology, epidemiology and treatment (Ballard, 2004; Barber et al., 2001; Cercy and Bylsma, 1997; Cummings, 2004; Kaufer, 2004; McKeith, 2002; McKeith et al., 2004a; Rampello et al., 2004) and only a few papers have reviewed cognitive impairments in DLB (Collerton et al., 2003; Lambon-Ralph et al., 2001; Simard et al., 2000). The present paper is more specifically targeted to a neuropsychological audience. It provides an up-to-date, detailed and comprehensive review of the available evidence regarding visual and olfactory perception, attention, cognitive fluctuation, frontal-executive functions, working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory in DLB relative to AD and PDD. In addition, an attempt is made to relate available data to current theoretical frameworks of cognition. Implications for future research and clinical issues such as the problem of differential diagnosis, and the relation between cognitive impairments and clinical features of visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuation will be discussed.

18067173|t|Association of olfactory dysfunction with risk for future Parkinson's disease.
18067173|a|OBJECTIVE: Although olfactory dysfunction is commonly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), it is not known whether such dysfunction can predate the onset of clinical PD in a community-based population. This study examines the association of olfactory dysfunction with future development of PD in Honolulu-Asia Aging Study cohort members METHODS: Olfaction was assessed from 1991 to 1996 in 2,267 men in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study aged 71 to 95 years who were free of clinical PD and dementia at the time of olfaction testing. Participants were followed for up to 8 years for incident PD RESULTS: In the course of follow-up, 35 men were diagnosed with PD (24.6/10,000 person-years). The average age at the time of diagnosis was 82.9 +/- 3.8 (range, 76-93) years, and the average time to a diagnosis was 4.0 +/- 1.9 (range, 1-8) years. During the first 4 years of follow-up, age-adjusted incidence of PD declined from 54.5/10,000 person-years in the lowest quartile of odor identification to 26.6, 8.2, and 8.4/10,000 person-years in the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively (p < 0.001 for trend). After adjustment for age and other potential confounders, the odds ratios for PD in the lowest quartile was 5.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-25.6) compared with the top two quartiles. This relation was not evident beyond 4 years of follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Impaired olfaction can predate clinical PD in men by at least 4 years and may be a useful screening tool to detect those at high risk for development of PD in later life.

18270312|t|Defects in tongue papillae and taste sensation indicate a problem with neurotrophic support in various neurological diseases.
18270312|a|Neurotrophic support of developing neurons by neurotrophins is of critical importance in the development of fungiform papillae and taste buds. A number of neurological disorders show a decrease or increase in fungiform papillae or taste sensation. These can be grouped into disorders with reduced papillae (Machado-Joseph disease, Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, familial dysautonomia, dystonia musculorum, and Behcet's disease) and those with taste defects only (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV, and diabetes mellitus). In addition, Parkinson's disease results in increased taste sensation. Here, we hypothesize that the main problem in these disorders is either not enough or too much neurotrophic support. Proneurotrophic drugs such as some antidepressants and aldose reductase inhibitors may prove useful in the treatment of these sensory and central nervous system disorders. Similarly, antineurotrophic drugs may also be useful in Parkinson's disease. Here we show that the protein involved in familial dysautonomia, IKAP, localizes to keratin filaments in HeLa cells, suggesting a role for the keratin cytoskeleton in neurotrophic support.

18313370|t|Respiratory responses to olfactory stimuli in Parkinson's disease.
18313370|a|There are many reports of olfactory impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and the impairment can be observed before the appearance of typical PD symptom. Accordingly, olfactory screening tests may predict disease onset and indicates a need for early treatment before classic signs of the disease. Olfaction is dependent on inspiration, and activation of olfactory limbic areas are synchronized with the natural breathing cycle in animals and humans. Subconscious changes in respiratory pattern occur in response to odor stimulation. The use of olfactory stimuli to investigate respiratory pattern could be used to assess olfactory perception and serve as an index for olfactory limbic activation. In this study, we tested olfactory acuity in normal subjects and in patients with PD and recorded V(O2) and respiratory variables during pleasant and unpleasant odor presentation. All subjects were able to detect the odorants; however patients with PD were assigned to one of two groups, group that could recognize odors or the group with impaired odor recognition. Respiratory response toward unpleasant and pleasant odor recognition were weak in PD groups who could recognize odors than normal subject as well as emotional response to odor stimuli. PD group with impaired odor recognition showed no respiratory response toward odor stimuli. PD may experience difficulty in feeling positive emotions toward pleasant odors prior to the unpleasant odor because respiratory responses to pleasant odors may also be related to higher processes including intentional control of breathing pattern as a result of olfactory cortex processing and perceptions or emotions.

18606556|t|Abnormality of taste and smell in Parkinson's disease.
18606556|a|BACKGROUND: Smell sense is impaired in classic Parkinson's disease (PD). An initial study found no change in taste threshold in non-demented PD subjects and pathological studies suggest that the first relay for taste, the nucleus of the solitary tract, is spared. We wished to determine if taste is abnormal in PD and whether it is associated with smell dysfunction. METHODS: Taste threshold was estimated using the Rion electrogustometer and olfaction by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 75 non-demented PD patients and 74 controls. RESULTS: There was a significant impairment of taste threshold and severe disorder of smell identification in the PD group. Age, duration of symptoms, disability, and smoking had no important effect on threshold measurement and there was no correlation between taste and smell dysfunction. Sensitivity analysis suggested that a provisional diagnosis of PD would be confirmed if smell or taste were abnormal; conversely, the diagnosis would merit review if both modalities were normal. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired taste appreciation was found in about 27% of patients with clinically defined PD. There were no important effects from age, disease severity or smell sense. Given the sparing of the first and second order taste neurones in PD, disorder of taste in PD most likely signifies involvement of the frontal operculum or orbitofrontal cortex, in keeping with advanced disease, although confounding by drug effects and changes in salivary constitution could not be excluded completely.

19047559|t|Is olfactory impairment in Parkinson disease related to phenotypic or genotypic characteristics?
19047559|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between olfactory impairment (OI) and other impairment domains in Parkinson disease (PD) and the characteristics of OI in patients with certain genotypic characteristics. METHODS: In 295 nondemented patients with PD and 150 controls with a similar overall age and sex distribution, olfactory function was evaluated with the identification (ID) and discrimination (DIS) tests of the Sniffin' Sticks. In patients, demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated, and genetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of all patients, 61% had an impaired ID and 43% had an impaired DIS. No significant correlations >0.4 were found between olfactory scores and other demographic or clinical variables. Age and sex accounted for the 22% explained variance of the ID score regression model, whereas age, sex, and disease duration accounted for the 15% explained variance of the DIS score regression model. Parkin and DJ-1 mutation carriers (homozygous or heterozygous compound, n = 6) had normal ID scores. APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 carriers had no significantly different olfactory scores than noncarriers. The allele distribution of the alpha-synuclein (SNCA)-REP1 polymorphism in groups with an impaired or normal ID or DIS was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory impairment (OI) in Parkinson disease (PD) may be unrelated to other impairment domains of the disease, which may indicate that olfaction is an independent feature of PD. Parkin and DJ-1 mutation carriers had normal identification scores but the number of mutation carriers is too small to draw conclusions. The APOE genotype (APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 alleles) and SNCA-REP1 polymorphism do not seem to influence olfaction in PD.

19686220|t|Olfactory impairment in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.
19686220|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) impairs olfaction, but it is uncertain how early this occurs in the disease process and whether the effect can be accounted for by other behavioral or genetic markers of the disease. We administered the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) to 471 older people without dementia or cognitive impairment who then completed annual clinical evaluations and brain autopsy at death. BSIT score was associated with more rapid decline in episodic memory and with increased risk of developing incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), even after controlling for baseline level of episodic memory and possession of an apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele. In 34 people who died without evidence of cognitive impairment, lower BSIT score was associated with higher level of AD pathology, even after controlling for epsilon4 and for level of episodic memory function when olfaction was assessed. These analyses suggest that among older people without clinical manifestations of AD or MCI, olfactory dysfunction is related to both the level of AD pathology in the brain and the risk of subsequently developing prodromal symptoms of the disease, and that these associations persist after accounting for the effects of other recognized behavioral and genetic markers of the disease.

19774531|t|[Sense of smell, physiological ageing and neurodegenerative diseases: II. Ageing and neurodegenerative diseases].
19774531|a|INTRODUCTION: The sense of smell, which was once studied because of its biological and evolutionary significance, is today one of the centres of interest in research on normal and pathological ageing. The latest scientific developments point to an inversely proportional relationship between age and olfactory sensitivity. In certain neurodegenerative diseases this sensory decline is one of the first symptoms of the disorder and is correlated with the progression of the disease. DEVELOPMENT: In this work we are going to review the scientific knowledge on loss of sense of smell in ageing and in neurodegenerative diseases, with special attention given to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. CONCLUSIONS: A survey of studies that have examined the olfactory deficits in ageing and in some neurodegenerative diseases offers conclusive results about the presence of these impairments in the early stages of these disorders and even among healthy elderly persons. Although a number of causes contribute to these sensory losses in physiological ageing, a common neurological foundation has been proposed for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Nevertheless, despite certain initial similarities, the olfactory deficits shown in these disorders seem to be qualitatively different.

19783195|t|Olfaction and apathy in Parkinson's disease.
19783195|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits are frequent among patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, apathy (as quantified by the Apathy Evaluation Scale), is more prevalent in PD patients compared to the general population. Olfactory impairment and apathy are associated with dysfunction in overlapping brain regions. Neuroimaging studies indicate that the anterior cingulate gyrus and medial orbitofrontal cortex are hypoactive in apathetic patients and are also involved in secondary olfactory processing. However, no study until this point has been published investigating whether there is any association between olfactory dysfunction and apathy in PD patients. METHODS: In our study seventy consecutive patients with PD took the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), completed the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and were administered the Folstein Mini-Mental Status exam (MMSE). RESULTS: Apathetic PD patients performed poorly on the B-SIT compared with non-apathetic PD patients and olfactory impairment correlated with apathy. The simultaneous disruption of olfaction and emotion in Parkinson's could be the result of disease pathology in brain regions involved in both olfactory and emotional processing and reinforces the idea that this link between olfaction and emotions may have clinical consequences.

20084814|t|Ageing, neurodegeneration, and olfactory and gustatory loss.
20084814|a|Olfactory and gustatory disorders increase with advancing age. Moreover, olfactory disorders are common in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since the decrease in olfactory function is usually gradual, it often remains undetected. Given the poor self-assessment of olfactory function, olfactory testing is mandatory in suspected cases to establish the diagnosis of hyposmia or anosmia. The high rate of anosmia over the age of 70 is suspected to be due to several factors such as changes in the olfactory epithelium (reduced mucus secretion, hormonal changes, changes in epithelial thickness, for example), and the reduced neuroregeneration rate in olfactory receptor cells themselves. There is no known adequate treatment for stopping or reversing this age-related decline in olfaction. In IPD, olfactory impairment precedes motor symptoms by years and is independent of dopaminergic loss. Using fMRI, altered neuronal activity in the amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation during olfactory stimulation have been demonstrated, as has a link between the expression of olfactory event-related potentials and olfactory-induced brain activity. In AD--by contrast with IPD--the severity of the disease and the olfactory disorder correlate. The olfactory disorders alone, however, cannot distinguish between AD and IPD. A complete loss of gustatory function is rare, while dysgeusia is common, especially with increasing age. There are multiple possible explanations, including concomitant disease and the side-effects of medication. These need to be established on the basis of exact history and examination. Treatment remains difficult.

20131383|t|Cardiac sympathetic degeneration correlates with olfactory function in Parkinson's disease.
20131383|a|Autonomic and olfactory dysfunctions are considered markers for preclinical diagnosis in Parkinson's disease (PD), because pathological changes in these systems can start before motor symptoms develop. We investigated whether cardiac sympathetic function and olfactory function are associated in PD. Participants comprised 40 nondemented patients with idiopathic PD, and age-matched controls. Cardiac sympathetic function was evaluated by (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake, in terms of the heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio in both early and delayed images, and the washout rate (WR). Olfactory function was evaluated using the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese, which evaluates the detection of 12 odorants familiar to Japanese participants. Smell identification scores were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in patients with PD than in controls. Smell identification scores correlated positively with early (P < 0.05) and delayed H/M ratios (P < 0.01), and inversely with the WR (P < 0.005) especially in patients with early PD (below 5 years of the start of motor symptoms), whereas smell identification scores did not correlate with any parameters of MIBG in the advanced PD (above 5 years of the start of motor symptoms). There was no correlation between motor symptom scores and smell identification scores, H/M ratios, or WR. The results suggest that the cardiac sympathetic nervous system might degenerate in parallel with the olfactory system in patients with early PD, and that these two systems might degenerate at a different rate of speed in advanced PD.

20709038|t|Olfactory deficit detected by fMRI in early Alzheimer's disease.
20709038|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by smell dysfunction, as measured by psychophysical tests. Currently, it is unknown whether AD-related alterations in central olfactory system neural activity, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are detectable beyond those observed in healthy elderly. Moreover, it is not known whether such changes are correlated with indices of odor perception and dementia. To investigate these issues, 12 early stage AD patients and 13 nondemented controls underwent fMRI while being exposed to each of three concentrations of lavender oil odorant. All participants were administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal at primary olfactory cortex (POC) was weaker in AD than in HC subjects. At the lowest odorant concentration, the BOLD signals within POC, hippocampus, and insula were significantly correlated with UPSIT, MMSE, DRS-2, and CDR scores. The BOLD signal intensity and activation volume within the POC increased significantly as a function of odorant concentration in the AD group, but not in the control group. These findings demonstrate that olfactory fMRI is sensitive to the AD-related olfactory and cognitive functional decline.

20847402|t|Functional representation of olfactory impairment in early Alzheimer's disease.
20847402|a|We used [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET analysis to determine performance in different olfactory domains of patients with early AD compared to cognitively healthy subjects, and to map the functional metabolic representation of olfactory impairment in the patient sample. A cohort of patients with early AD (n=24), consisting of 6 subjects with incipient AD and 18 subjects with mild AD, and a control group of 28 age-matched non-demented individuals were assembled. Patients and controls were tested for olfactory performance using the "Sniffin' Sticks" test battery [odor identification (ID), discrimination (DIS) and threshold (THR)], while patients additionally underwent resting state FDG-PET. Voxel-wise PET results in the patients were correlated with olfaction scores using the general linear model in SPM5. Patients with early AD showed significantly reduced function in all three olfactory subdomains compared to controls. After controlling for effects due to patients' age, gender, cognitive status, and treating scores in the two other olfactory subdomains as nuisance variables, ID scores correlated with normalized FDG uptake in clusters with peaks in the right superior parietal lobule, fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus, while DIS scores correlated with a single cluster in the left postcentral cortex, and THR scores correlated with clusters in the right thalamus and cerebellum. The subtests employed in the "Sniffin' Sticks" test battery are complementary indicators of different aspects of olfactory dysfunction in early AD, and support the theory of a parallel organized olfactory system, revealed by FDG-PET correlation analysis.

21284041|t|Association of olfactory dysfunction and brain. Metabolism in Parkinson's disease.
21284041|a|Hyposmia is one of the cardinal early symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD). Accumulating clinical and pathological evidence suggests that dysfunction of the olfactory-related cortices may be responsible for the impaired olfactory processing observed in PD; however, there are no clear data showing a direct association between altered brain metabolism and hyposmia in PD. In this study, we evaluated brain glucose metabolism and smell-identification ability in 69 Japanese patients with nondemented PD. Olfactory function was assessed using the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese. The regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption at rest was measured using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and was analyzed using SPM-based group comparisons and the brain-behavior partial least-squares method. We found that olfactory dysfunction was closely related to cognitive dysfunction, including memory impairment. Moreover, brain-behavior partial least-squares analysis revealed that odor-identification performance was closely associated with broad cortical dysfunction, including dysfunction of the piriform cortex and amygdala. Our results suggest that the cognitive deficit in olfactory perception is an important aspect of hyposmia in PD and that this deficit is caused by altered brain metabolism in the amygdala and piriform cortex.

21378378|t|Olfactory deficits in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease in the polish elderly population.
21378378|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia. For this reason, a simple, reliable, and inexpensive method of early AD detection is urgently required. The location of neuropathological changes in AD patients indicates the potential diagnostic utility of olfactory tests. The purpose of this study was to compare odor identification performance among Polish subjects and to define the correlation between olfactory deficits and cognitive impairment. Olfactory identification performance was established in AD patients, and young and elderly healthy subjects using the Pocket Smell Test. AD Assessment Scale, the cognitive subscale, was used to evaluate cognitive functioning in the elderly participants. Compared with young subjects, the elderly individuals exhibited a diminished capacity to identify odors. AD patients also identified significantly fewer odors than healthy participants of the same age. In both the AD patients and the elderly control group, odor identification ability correlated with performance in cognitive tests. It may be concluded that deficits in olfactory identification occur in AD and may be valuable as an indicator of this condition.

21611983|t|Olfactory deficits and cardiac 123I-MIBG in Parkinson's disease related to the LRRK2 R1441G and G2019S mutations.
21611983|a|It has been proposed that olfactory tests and metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy may help diagnose idiopathic Parkinson's disease in the premotor phase. However, it is not clear what value these tests have in all patients with Parkinson's disease and, particularly, in those who carry mutations in LRRK2. The objective was to analyze olfactory dysfunction and the changes in cardiac I-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake in patients with Parkinson's disease carrying the R1441G and G2019S mutations in LRRK2, and in patients with Parkinson's disease with no known mutations. Patients with Parkinson's disease were screened for R1441G and G2019S LRRK2 gene mutations and classified as LRRK2 mutation carriers or noncarriers. A total of 190 patients with Parkinson's disease (44 LRRK2 mutation carriers) were tested for olfactory dysfunction using the Brief Smell Identification Test. Cardiac (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy was performed on 90 patients with Parkinson's disease (27 LRRK2 mutation carriers). Thirty-six percent of patients with LRRK2 mutations have hyposmia, compared to 75% of noncarrier patients with Parkinson's disease (P < .001). Sixty-six percent of LRRK2 mutation carriers have low early metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake, compared to 86% of noncarriers (P = .048). Similarly, the heart/mediastinum ratio in delayed metaiodobenzylguanidine images appeared to differ between these groups of patients with Parkinson's disease, although these results did not reach statistical significance. The data obtained indicate that olfactory and cardiac impairment is less prevalent when Parkinson's disease is associated with mutations in LRRK2, although the underlying mechanisms for this difference remain unclear. Thus, such screening would be less useful to detect the premotor phase in asymptomatic relatives who carry mutations in LRRK2 than in cases not associated with LRRK2.

21611985|t|Olfactory dysfunction is associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations in Parkinson's disease.
21611985|a|Hyposmia, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive problems are common nonmotor manifestations in Parkinson's disease, but how they are related remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and neuropsychiatric manifestations and performed a cross-sectional study of 248 patients at two movement disorders clinics at academic medical centers. Psychiatric measures were the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, State Anxiety Inventory, Apathy Scale, and Parkinson's Psychosis Rating Scale. Cognitive measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Tower of London-Drexel, and the Stroop Color Word Test. Olfaction was tested with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. There was no significant association between olfaction and mood measures, but psychotic symptoms were more common in patients with olfaction scores below the median (30% vs. 12%; P < 0.001). Worse olfaction was associated with poorer memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed recall items: mean [standard deviation], 6.2 [3.2] vs. 8.4 [2.8]; P < 0.001) and executive performance (Tower of London total moves, 52 [38] vs. 34 [21]; P < 0.001). Odor-identification score was a significant predictor of abnormal performance on these cognitive tests after adjustment for age, sex, and disease characteristics in logistic regression models. The relationship between hyposmia, psychosis, and specific cognitive impairments may reflect the anatomic distribution of Lewy pathology and suggests that olfactory dysfunction could be a biomarker of additional extranigral disease. Future prospective studies are warranted to assess whether hyposmia, a very early feature of Parkinson's disease, might be used to predict the appearance of other common nonmotor symptoms.

22001456|t|Frequency and characteristics of taste impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease: results of a clinical interview.
22001456|a|OBJECTIVE: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently complain of a diminished sense of smell. Less frequently, they may complain of taste impairment. In the present study, we investigated the symptoms, frequency, and severity of taste impairment as well as smell impairment in PD patients and compared the results with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We interviewed 285 PD patients (120 men, 165 women) without dementia or nasal problems. Control subjects comprised 61 (20 men, 41 women) healthy spouses of the PD patients. Alteration of smell and taste sense lasting more than 3 months was defined as abnormal. RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen patients with PD complained of smell impairment and 26 complained of taste impairment. Only 5 controls complained of smell impairment, and no control subjects reported taste impairment. Taste impairment was more marked in patients with smell impairment. Impaired taste included diminished taste perception in 21 patients, altered sense of taste in 4 patients and burning mouth in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Taste as well as smell perception is impaired in patients with PD. The frequency of smell and taste impairments tended to increase with disease progression.

22057152|t|Psychophysiological and electrophysiological testing of olfactory and gustatory function in patients with multiple sclerosis.
22057152|a|The olfactory (OF) and gustatory function in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and possible influencing variables of the disease, such as depression or fatigue, were determined. In an open prospective controlled clinical study 30 patients with MS and 30 healthy controls matched for age, sex and smoking-habits were investigated. With Mini Mental State Examination cognitive dysfunction was excluded, with Expanded Disability Status Scale the patient's ability to accomplish the tests was ensured. The severity of depression was measured with the self-reported Beck Depression Inventory. The orthonasal olfactory function was derived with olfactory event related potentials (OERP) and TDI-score (Threshold, Discrimination and Identification, Sniffin' Sticks). Retronasal olfactory function was tested with Taste-Powder-score, gustatory function with Taste-strip-score. There was a significant loss of olfactory function measured with TDI-score [12/30 (40%), p = 0.002] and gustatory function [5/23 (21.7%), p < 0.001] in MS-patients, 23.8% (5/21) of MS-patients showed hyposmia with OERPs, significantly correlating with the TDI-score (p = 0.03). The Expanded Disability Status scale score inversely correlated with the TDI-score (p = 0.002). This study confirms the incidence of olfactory disorder in MS-patients and reveals a frequent gustatory deficit. The Identification subtest can be proposed as a marker of the OF in MS-patients: it includes complex cognitive tasks and may be influenced by depression and fatigue, which are common symptoms of MS. It inversely correlates with the disability status.

22341621|t|Olfactory function in patients with multiple sclerosis: a diffusion tensor imaging study.
22341621|a|BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients can develop olfactory disturbances. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate how olfactory function in MS patients correlates with cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Olfactory performance was tested in 30 MS patients and 30 controls to determine odour threshold (T), odour discrimination (D), and odour identification (I) summarised in the TDI score. The lesion load (number and total volume of lesions) was measured on proton-density (PD)- and T2-weighted images of the olfactory brain and the total brain. Fractional anisotropy (FA) of the lesions and the surrounding normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) was quantified using DTI. RESULTS: The median FA of white matter lesions was 0.29 and was on average 11.1% lower than in the surrounding NABT. The normalised TDI score and the normalised I subscore were significantly poorer in the MS group compared to controls (p<0.0001), while the T and D subscores were similar in both groups. The median FA of lesions in the olfactory brain correlated inversely with the decreased I subscore (p=0.001). There was also a strong correlation between the TDI score and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: A strong inverse relationship between decreased odour identification ability of MS patients and FA values in the olfactory brain indicates that the reduction in I is more strongly affected by lesions in areas with high FA values, i.e., with an increased amount of affected white matter tracts.

22818527|t|Impaired pain processing in Parkinson's disease and its relative association with the sense of smell.
22818527|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many non-motor symptoms are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Of these, pain and olfactory disturbance tend to be common premotor symptoms. PD has been shown to exhibit abnormal central pain processing, although underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In order to investigate this further, we assessed PD patients by specific Adelta stimulation with intra-epidermal needle electrode and determined olfactory function. METHODS: Forty-two patients (18 males and 24 females) with PD and 17 healthy control subjects (8 males and 9 females) were studied. A thin needle electrode was used to stimulate epidermal Adelta fibers, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) recorded at the vertex. Olfactory function was evaluated using the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) and its relationship with pain-related SEPs was investigated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in N1 latencies or P1 latencies although N1/P1 peak-to-peak amplitudes were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in PD patients than in control subjects. In PD patients, there were significant correlations between N1/P1 amplitudes and disease duration (r = -0.35, p < 0.05), Hoehn-Yahr stage (r = -0.38, p < 0.05) and UPDRS part III (r = -0.42, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the OSIT-J scores correlated with SEP amplitude (r = 0.41, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Pain processing in PD patients was impaired under specific nociceptive stimulation of Adelta fibers and significant correlation with smell dysfunction was detected. We suggest that this mechanism may involve the limbic system during PD pathology.

23314063|t|Olfactory deficit and hippocampal volume loss for early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease: a pilot study.
23314063|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this pilot study was to verify the role of olfactory test and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging measure of hippocampus to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment, broadly defined, were followed at 12 months. Hypothesized baseline predictors for follow-up conversion to AD were olfactory deficit and hippocampal volumes loss. RESULTS: In the 1-year follow-up, 5 patients converted to AD. The 2 clinical predictors olfactory test and hippocampal volume loss showed the same sensitivity of 92.3% but the olfactory test showed a higher specificity than the hippocampal volume loss (75% vs. 60%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the potential utility of olfactory test and hippocampal volume loss for early detection of AD.

23398350|t|Olfaction and apathy in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy older adults.
23398350|a|OBJECTIVES: Apathy is a prevalent neuropsychiatric manifestation in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is associated with decreased social functioning and increased caregiver burden. Olfactory deficits are also commonly observed in AD, and prior work has indicated a link between increased apathy and olfactory dysfunction in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Here, we examined odor identification performance in patients with probable AD (n = 172), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 112), and neurologically and psychiatrically healthy older adults (n = 132) and its relation to apathy, depression, and overall psychopathology. METHOD: Participants were administered the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test and measures assessing severity of apathy, depression, and overall neuropsychiatric symptomatology. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, AD and MCI patients were significantly worse at identifying odors than healthy older adults. Additionally, a sex by diagnosis interaction was observed. AD patients had significantly higher levels of apathy relative to MCI and control participants. Of note, across the entire sample odor identification deficits were correlated with level of apathy at the level of p < 0.01, but not with depression or neuropsychiatric symptom severity, when controlling for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data suggest that olfactory disturbance and apathy in AD may result from the progression of disease pathology in shared neural substrates.

23597130|t|Smell identification function as a severity and progression marker in Alzheimer's disease.
23597130|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction, impaired smell identification in particular, is known as a diagnostic and a marker of conversion in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to evaluate the associations of olfactory identification impairments with cognition, illness severity, and progression in AD patients. METHODS: Fifty-seven outpatients with late onset mild to moderate AD and 24 elderly non-demented controls (NDC) were assessed, at baseline and after three months, for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), and Bristol Activities of Daily Living and Neuropsychiatry Inventory. AD participants were classified as Rapid Cognitive Decliners (RCD) defined on a priori with a loss of >=2 points in MMSE within the previous six months. RESULTS: AD participants had lower olfactory scores than NDC. RCD had lower olfaction scores compared with Non-Rapid Cognitive Decliners (NRCD). Although the baseline UPSIT scores were associated with baseline MMSE scores, it did not interact significantly with change in MMSE over the follow-up period. Using a median split for olfactory scores, the AD participants were classified as Rapid Olfactory Progressors (ROP) (UPSIT <= 15) and Slow Olfactory Progressors correlating significantly with RCD/NRCD groups. The ROP group with higher olfactory impairment indicated more symptomatic illness or severity, i.e. lower cognition, higher functional dependence, and presence of behavioral symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports association of smell identification function with cognition and its utility as an adjunct clinical measure to assess severity in AD. Further work, including larger longitudinal studies, is needed to explore its value in predicting AD progression.

23628669|t|Decreased coherence between the two olfactory bulbs in Alzheimer's disease model mice.
23628669|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by cell and synapse losses and the ensued network disconnections. Olfactory impairment is common and occurs early in AD patients, suggesting its potential role in the early diagnosis of AD. However, the functional connectivity of the olfactory system in AD has received little attention. Using local field potentials symmetrically recorded from the two olfactory bulbs in awake mice, we found that in AD model mice with robust amyloid-beta burden, the coherence between the two bulbs for spontaneous activities was significantly lower in all of the four frequency bands (theta, beta, low and high gamma: 2-12, 15-35, 35-65 and 65-100 Hz, respectively). Moreover, the coherence for odor-evoked activities was also lower, particularly in the beta band, when compared to their wild-type littermates. These results demonstrate that the inter-bulbar functional connectivity is impaired in AD mice, indicating a failure of brain activation in beta-related functions, which might be of importance in the diagnosis of AD.

23831930|t|[Early recognition of Parkinson's disease. Objectifiable non-motor symptoms and biomarkers].
23831930|a|The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) according to the UK Brain Bank criteria is based on the presence of motor symptoms and the response to dopaminergic medication. According to these criteria the clinical diagnosis is delineated too late when more than 50 % of the dopaminergic neurons are already degenerated. In recent years interest has shifted increasingly more towards non-motor symptoms (NMS), such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), constipation, hyposmia and neuropsychiatric as well as cognitive symptoms. It was shown that NMS can precede the motor symptoms by some years and may thus possibly enable support of an earlier clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid or blood biomarkers as well as brain imaging techniques can objectively support an earlier diagnosis of PD. This article reviews important NMSs (e.g. RBD, hyposmia and neuropsychiatric/cognitive symptoms) as well as the current status on biomarkers and brain imaging in early (premotor) phases of PD and their relevance for the early diagnosis.

24637128|t|Hyposmia and cardiovascular dysautonomia correlatively appear in early-stage Parkinson's disease.
24637128|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory dysfunction is considered to precede motor symptoms and early markers of Parkinson's disease (PD), while the relative time at which cardiovascular dysautonomia appears in PD is not well understood. To assess the appearance of cardiovascular dysautonomia in PD, we evaluated its relation to olfactory dysfunction in early-stage PD patients. METHODS: Twenty-three non-demented PD patients within 2 years from the onset of motor symptoms were enrolled. We evaluated olfactory dysfunction by the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) and analyzed its relationship to the results of other cardiovascular autonomic tests and cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. RESULTS: There was a correlation between olfactory scores and increased blood pressure in both the norepinephrine (r = 0.75, p < 0.0001, n = 21) and dobutamine (r = 0.57, p = 0.0087, n = 20) infusion tests and cardiac MIBG uptake (r = 0.42, p = 0.049, n = 23). The fall in orthostatic blood pressure during the head-up tilt test was not correlated with the olfactory scores, but the Valsalva maneuver revealed that OSIT-J scores correlated with the pressure recovery time from phase III to the return of blood pressure to baseline (r = 0.54, p = 0.037, n = 15) and with the magnitude of blood pressure overshoot during phase IV (r = 0.67, p = 0.0016, n = 20). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that extensive components of the cardiovascular sympathetic system as well as the olfactory system are correlatively impaired in the early stage of PD, suggesting that degeneration of broad aspects of the cardiovascular sympathetic system occurs concurrently with olfactory system degeneration during the premotor phase of PD.

24792992|t|Adapting the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory test to diagnose Parkinson's disease in Estonia.
24792992|a|UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to develop a culturally adapted translation of the 12-item smell identification test from Sniffin' Sticks (SS-12) for the Estonian population in order to help diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: A standard translation of the SS-12 was created and 150 healthy Estonians were questioned about the smells used as response options in the test. Unfamiliar smells were replaced by culturally familiar options. The adapted SS-12 was applied to 70 controls in all age groups, and thereafter to 50 PD patients and 50 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: 14 response options from 48 used in the SS-12 were replaced with familiar smells in an adapted version, in which the mean rate of correct response was 87% (range 73-99) compared to 83% with the literal translation (range 50-98). In PD patients, the average adapted SS-12 score (5.4/12) was significantly lower than in controls (average score 8.9/12), p < 0.0001. A multiple linear regression using the score in the SS-12 as the outcome measure showed that diagnosis and age independently influenced the result of the SS-12. A logistic regression using the SS-12 and age as covariates showed that the SS-12 (but not age) correctly classified 79.0% of subjects into the PD and control category, using a cut-off of <7 gave a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 86% for the diagnosis of PD. CONCLUSIONS: The developed SS-12 cultural adaption is appropriate for testing olfaction in Estonia for the purpose of PD diagnosis.

25047369|t|Detection of olfactory dysfunction using olfactory event related potentials in young patients with multiple sclerosis.
25047369|a|BACKGROUND: Several studies reported olfactory dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis. The estimate of the incidence of olfactory deficits in multiple sclerosis is uncertain; this may arise from different testing methods that may be influenced by patients' response bias and clinical, demographic and cognitive features. AIMS: To evaluate objectively the olfactory function using Olfactory Event Related Potentials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the olfactory function of 30 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (mean age of 36.03+-6.96 years) and of 30 age, sex and smoking-habit matched healthy controls by using olfactory potentials. A selective and controlled stimulation of the olfactory system to elicit the olfactory event related potentials was achieved by a computer-controlled olfactometer linked directly with electroencephalograph. Relationships between olfactory potential results and patients' clinical characteristics, such as gender, disability status score, disease-modifying therapy, and disease duration, were evaluated. RESULTS: Seven of 30 patients did not show olfactory event related potentials. Sixteen of remaining 23 patients had a mean value of amplitude significantly lower than control group (p<0.01). The presence/absence of olfactory event related potentials was associated with dichotomous expanded disability status scale (p = 0.0433), as well as inversely correlated with the disease duration (r = -0.3641, p = 0.0479). CONCLUSION: Unbiased olfactory dysfunction of different severity found in multiple sclerosis patients suggests an organic impairment which could be related to neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative processes of olfactory networks, supporting the recent findings on neurophysiopathology of disease.

25084842|t|Olfactory deficits in frontotemporal dementia as measured by the Alberta Smell Test.
25084842|a|The study of olfaction in neurodegeneration has primarily focused on Alzheimer's disease. Research of olfaction in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has generally not been empirically studied. The current study compared olfaction in FTD to major depressive disorder (MDD) using the Alberta Smell Test (AST). Independent-samples t test results suggested olfaction in FTD was impaired when compared with participants diagnosed with MDD. The AST Total score (out of 20 trials) significantly predicted the diagnostic group and accounted for 40% of the variance in diagnostic group status with an odds ratio of 20.08. Results suggested that a cutoff of <=2/20 differentiated FTD from MDD with 94% accuracy (91% sensitivity, 97% specificity) and a cutoff of <=1/20 differentiated the groups with a 95.5% hit rate (91% sensitivity, 100% specificity). Results confirmed olfactory identification deficits in FTD and suggested that the AST is an effective tool for the demarcation of FTD from MDD. This is especially important due to the potential for significant overlap in the behavioral/emotional phenotype and cognitive deficits between the two disorders when presented with early stages of FTD.

25347335|t|[The forgotten cranial nerve--clinical importance of olfaction].
25347335|a|Hyposmia is often undiagnosed despite the known negative effect on taste, appetite and life quality. However, a new focus on the first cranial nerve has emerged as a consequence of a discovered connection between neurodegenerative disorders and hyposmia. In Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease hyposmia is not only one of the earliest clinical presentations, the degree of hyposmia also correlates with the later progression of these two conditions. Hyposmia should not be ignored nor accepted; instead it should be integrated in any neurological examination, especially in elderly patients.

25764922|t|[Olfactory function in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease].
25764922|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between olfactory bulb (OB) volume with depth of olfactory sulcus (OS) and olfactory function in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). METHODS: One hundred patients with IPD between January 2011 to December 2013 in Tianjin Huanhu Hospotal were compared with one hundred controls in terms of olfactory function T&T testing, OB volume and depth of OS assessed with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One hundred IPD patients were investigated and estimated H-Y degrees, UPDRS, MMSE, MoCA. SPSS 13.0 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: T&T olfactory testing revealed that IPD patients (3.0 +- 0.3) had higher scores than controls (1.3 +- 0.2, t = 2.537, P < 0.01). Both men and women with IPD were affected by the same extent of olfactory loss (t = 0.893, P > 0.05). Both men and women as controls were affected by the same extent of olfactory loss(t = 1.184, P > 0.05). OB volume of left side in IPD patients was (34.25 +- 5.14) mm(3), right side was (35.79 +- 5.28)mm(3), average OB volume was (35.28 +- 5.21) mm(3); OB volume of left side in controls was (47.38 +- 6.47) mm(3), right side was (47.75 +- 6.51) mm(3), average OB volume was (47.53 +- 6.49) mm(3); OB volume were lower in IPD patients as compared to controls (t value were 2.876, 2.747, 2.798, all P < 0.01). OS depth study revealed no statistical difference between IPD patients and controls (t value were 0.914, 0.987, 0.951, all P > 0.05). Olfactory discriminate threshold was negatively correlated with average OB volume in IPD patients and controls (r value were -0.537,-0.526, both P < 0.05); was no correlated with average depth of OS (r value were -0.142, -0.157, both P > 0.05). There was relation between the average OB volume and UPDRS III, UPDRS, the degree of H-Y in IPD patients (r value were 0.312, -0.419, -0.358, all P < 0.05). However the average OB volume was not related to the course of disease (r = -0.089, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The OB volume is lower in IPD patients as compared to controls, the depth of OS have no significant changes in IPD patients; The OB volume is correlated with olfactory function, the depth of OS is not correlated with olfactory function; Olfactory function lower degree is accordance with serious degree in IPD patients, is not accordance with the course of disease.

26103667|t|[Olfactory function in patients with Alzheimer' disease].
26103667|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between olfactory bulb (OB) volume, depth of olfactory sulcus (OS) and olfactory function in patients with Alzheimer' disease (AD). METHOD: Fifty patients with AD patients and 50 healthy subjects were examined by olfactory function T&T testing, OB volume and depth of OS assessed with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULT: T&T olfactory testing revealed that AD patients had higher scores than control group (1.50 +- 0.17, 2.80 +- 0.31, P < 0.05). Bilateral and average OB volumes were smaller in AD group [(29.78 +- 5.17) mm3, (30.14 +- 4.87)mm3, (30.05 +- 5.08) mm3] than in control group [(36.65 +- 4.08)mm3, (36.56 +- 4.12)mm3, (36.46 +- 4.11)mm3] (P < 0.01). OS depth study revealed no statistical difference between AD patients and control groups (P > 0.05). Olfactory discriminate threshold was negatively correlated with average olfactory bulb volumes (r = -0. 711, P < 0.05), and was not correlated with depth of OS (r = -0.127, P > 0.05) in AD patients. CONCLUSION: The OB volume were lower in AD patients as compare to controls, the depth of OS has no significant changes in AD patients; The OB volume is correlated with olfactory function, the depth of OS is no correlated with olfactory function. Cognitive impairment degree in AD patients is accordance with the lower degree olfactory function. The olfactory loss may be the earlier period and objective diagnosis indicator for AD patients.

26148933|t|Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in Myasthenia gravis: A study in Turkish patients.
26148933|a|OBJECTIVE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is commonly viewed as a muscle disorder. Less is known about neurosensory function and dysfunction in MG. We aim to evaluate olfactory and gustatory behavior in Turkish patients with MG, and compare these results with age and sex-matched healthy controls. MATERIAL/METHODS: 30 individuals with MG, and 30 healthy volunteers were studied. Olfactory function was studied with the Sniffin' sticks test. Taste strip test was used for studying taste function. The t-test was used for analyzing continuous variables, and the chi-square test for categorical data. Clinical staging and medication status were included in a model analyzed using analysis of variances. RESULTS: MG patients showed significantly lower olfactory (p<0.001) and gustatory scores (p<0.001) than the healthy controls. In addition, olfactory loss correlated with the severity of the disease. Medications for MG did not influence these results. CONCLUSION: This study replicates the olfactory dysfunction found elsewhere in MG. Further, gustatory dysfunction, an activity unrelated to muscle strength, was also unveiled. Medications used for treating MG must not be blamed for the chemosensory dysfunction found in this neurological disorder.

26423603|t|Decline of gustatory sensitivity with the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
26423603|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifest various impairments in eating behavior. However, few previous studies have directly investigated the gustatory function of AD patients, and results have been inconsistent. METHODS: Thirty-two AD patients (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5/1/2, respectively 11/15/6 patients) and 22 normal control participants were examined to measure detection and recognition thresholds of the four elemental tastes (sweet, salty, sour, and bitter), and their ability to discriminate between tastes. Effects of demographic and clinical factors (age, sex, histories of alcohol and tobacco consumption, and CDR grade) on gustatory threshold were examined using ordinal logistic regression analysis. Performance was compared between AD and control groups. RESULTS: Total threshold values (the sum of threshold grades for the four tastes) for detection and recognition of tastes were significantly higher in the AD group. Detection thresholds for sweet, salty, and bitter, and recognition thresholds for sweet and sour, were also significantly higher in the AD group. Ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that CDR grade was the only factor that significantly affected both total threshold values. Regarding taste discrimination, there were no significant differences between the AD group and control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that progression of dementia severity accompanies gustatory decline. Although it seemingly paradoxical, weight loss and preference for sweet tastes are frequently, often simultaneously, observed in AD. Gustatory dysfunction may be partially involved in these symptoms. Thus, the nutritional care of patients with AD could be improved by making the taste of meals stronger, while controlling calorie and mineral intake.

26484905|t|Altered Affective Evaluations of Smells in Alzheimer's Disease.
26484905|a|BACKGROUND: Studies of olfaction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mainly focused on deficits in odor detection and identification, with very few investigations of olfactory emotional changes and their consequences for hedonics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to characterize affective evaluations of odors in AD patients. METHODS: To this end, 20 AD patients and 20 matched controls were tested. Participants were screened for odor detection and identification ability and then asked to rate the intensity, pleasantness, and edibility of 20 odorants. RESULTS: Results showed that, overall, AD patients had lower detection ability and perceived all odors as weaker than controls. As expected, they had lower identification ability on both cued and non-cued tasks. In addition, when smelling pleasant odors, patients had significantly lower hedonic ratings than controls (p <  0.02), whereas no group difference was found for neutral or unpleasant odors (p >  0.05 in both cases). Moreover, an analysis combining both intensity and pleasantness ratings showed that whereas intensity increased as a function of pleasantness and unpleasantness in controls, this quadratic relationship was not observed in AD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the simplest categorization criteria of odors (intensity and hedonic valence) are impaired in AD patients (especially for pleasant odors).

26569387|t|Association Between Olfactory Dysfunction and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Disease Dementia.
26569387|a|IMPORTANCE: To increase the opportunity to delay or prevent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, markers of early detection are essential. Olfactory impairment may be an important clinical marker and predictor of these conditions and may help identify persons at increased risk. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of impaired olfaction with incident MCI subtypes and progression from MCI subtypes to AD dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants enrolled in the population-based, prospective Mayo Clinic Study of Aging between 2004 and 2010 were clinically evaluated at baseline and every 15 months through 2014. Participants (N = 1630) were classified as having normal cognition, MCI (amnestic MCI [aMCI] and nonamnestic MCI [naMCI]), and dementia. We administered the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) to assess olfactory function. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, and longitudinal change in cognitive performance measures. RESULTS: Of the 1630 participants who were cognitively normal at the time of the smell test, 33 died before follow-up and 167 were lost to follow-up. Among the 1430 cognitively normal participants included, the mean (SD) age was 79.5 (5.3) years, 49.4% were men, the mean duration of education was 14.3 years, and 25.4% were APOE epsilon4 carriers. Over a mean 3.5 years of follow-up, there were 250 incident cases of MCI among 1430 cognitively normal participants. We observed an association between decreasing olfactory identification, as measured by a decrease in the number of correct responses in B-SIT score, and an increased risk of aMCI. Compared with the upper B-SIT quartile (quartile [Q] 4, best scores), hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) were 1.12 (0.65-1.92) for Q3 (P = .68); 1.95 (1.25-3.03) for Q2 (P = .003); and 2.18 (1.36-3.51) for Q1 (P = .001) (worst scores; P for trend <.001) after adjustment for sex and education, with age as the time scale. There was no association with naMCI. There were 64 incident dementia cases among 221 prevalent MCI cases. The B-SIT score also predicted progression from aMCI to AD dementia, with a significant dose-response with worsening B-SIT quartiles. Compared with Q4, HR (95% CI) estimates were 3.02 (1.06-8.57) for Q3 (P = .04); 3.63 (1.19-11.10) for Q2 (P = .02); and 5.20 (1.90-14.20) for Q1 (P = .001). After adjusting for key predictors of MCI risk, B-SIT (as a continuous measure) remained a significant predictor of MCI (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.04-1.16]; P < .001) and improved the model concordance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Olfactory impairment is associated with incident aMCI and progression from aMCI to AD dementia. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported associations of olfactory impairment with cognitive impairment in late life and suggest that olfactory tests have potential utility for screening for MCI and MCI that is likely to progress.

27706416|t|Olfactory alterations in patients with multiple sclerosis.
27706416|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess olfactory function using the Connecticut test and verify correlations between olfactory alteration, disease duration and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). METHODS: One hundred MS patients and 100 healthy control patients responded to a questionnaire. Those with olfactory alteration underwent a facial CT to exclude other causes. RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of patients showed alterations, compared with 3% in the healthy control group. Patients having EDSS above 4, showed a 5.2-times increased risk of dysfunction. Patients over 38 years of age have a 2.2-times increased risk over younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Because MS patients are likely to experience olfactory alterations, this study is a useful tool in follow-up care, although more studies are necessary to evaluate the correlations in MS evolution.

27735030|t|A study of the non-motor symptoms in early Parkinson's disease with olfactory deficits.
27735030|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine characteristics of non-motor symptoms (NMS) in early Parkinson's disease (PD) with olfactory deficits and to analyze the feasibility of diagnosing PD based on olfactory deficits. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients without olfactory deficits in early PD (PD group), 58 patients with olfactory deficits in early PD (olfactory deficits group) and 60 healthy examined people (control group) were selected successively. RESULTS: It was found that there was no statistical significance in the difference in ages and courses of disease among the three groups (p > 0.05). The percentage of males in the olfactory deficits group markedly increased, the NM-Quest score rose, the rate of cases complicated with a sleep disorder and constipation also increased significantly (p < 0.05). The comparison of depression occurrence rates and other NMS, as well as BUA levels in olfactory deficits group and PD group, showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). According to the relevant analysis, olfactory deficits were positively correlated with the occurrence of cpRBD and constipation (p < 0.05), while they showed no obvious correlation with depression, other NMS or the BUA level (p > 0.05). The degree of olfactory deficits was also positively correlated with the occurrence of cpRBD and constipation (p < 0.05). The prevalence rate of postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) in olfactory deficits group was noticeably higher than that in PD group, and olfactory deficits showed a positive correlation with the occurrence of PIGD (p > 0.05). A combination of NMS-Quest and Sniffin's Sticks was applied to the diagnosis of PD, and it yielded an AUC of 0.795 (sensitivity of 79.3%, specificity of 89.6%, with cutoff scores of 13.5 and 25.5 respectively). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy all increased markedly. CONCLUSIONS: The early PD may emerge with olfactory deficits and multiple other non-motor symptoms, and a joint application of NMS-Quest and olfactory rating can serve as a reference for the diagnosis of early PD.

27886011|t|Odor Identification Screening Improves Diagnostic Classification in Incipient Alzheimer's Disease.
27886011|a|BACKGROUND: Measurements of olfaction may serve as useful biomarkers of incipient dementia. Here we examine the improvement in diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) when assessing both cognitive functioning and odor identification. OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of odor identification as a supplementary screening test in incipient AD. METHODS: Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test (SS-OIT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered in 262 AD, 174 MCI [150 amnestic (aMCI), and 24 non-amnestic (naMCI)], and 292 healthy older adults (HOA). RESULTS: Odor identification scores were higher in HOA relative to MCI or AD groups, and MCI outperformed AD. Odor identification scores were higher in aMCI single domain than aMCI multiple domain. Complementing MoCA scores with the SS-OIT significantly improved diagnostic accuracy of individuals with AD and MCI, including within MCI subgroups. DISCUSSION: Odor identification is a useful supplementary screening tool that provides additional information relevant for clinical categorization of AD and MCI, including those who are at highest risk to convert to AD.

28017216|t|Olfactory ability in normal pressure hydrocephalus as compared to Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls.
28017216|a|OBJECTIVES: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a treatable neurological disorder that appears in older adults, lacks specific diagnostic criteria, and resembles symptoms seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presently, differentiating NPH from AD in the early stages of symptom presentation remains difficult. This study established whether olfactory testing may be useful in this regard. In addition, we determined whether olfactory function of NPH patients differed before and after extended lumbar drainage (ELD), as well as six months after surgical implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two NPH patients (mean age=77.6yrs), 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (mean age=79.9yrs), and 7 AD patients (mean age=75.5yrs) were administered the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Eighteen of the 22 NPH patients were also tested following ELD and 8 patients were tested six months following implantation of VP shunt. RESULTS: Prior to ELD, patients with NPH scored significantly higher on the UPSIT than those with AD [respective means (SDs)=26.9 (7.1) & 14.1 (4.7)]. While the mean NPH score was significantly below that of the matched controls [control mean (SD)=32.7 (6.7)], their test scores were nonetheless within the general normal range, as determined from published normative data (48th percentile). The UPSIT scores did not differ significantly among the three longitudinal time points in the NPH patients. CONCLUSION: Olfactory testing may be useful in differentiating between patients with NPH and patients with AD. Odor identification test scores of NPH patients are not influenced by the release of intracranial pressure via ELD or six months following implantation of a VP shunt.

28919173|t|Trigeminal system in Parkinson's disease: A potential avenue to detect Parkinson-specific olfactory dysfunction.
28919173|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is very frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and observed years before diagnosis. The trigeminal system, a chemosensory system allowing for the perception of spiciness, freshness, etc., is intimately connected to the olfactory system and although usually reduced in OD the trigeminal system is not well characterized in PD. We hypothesize that measuring trigeminal sensitivity potentially allows to discriminate between OD due to PD and OD due to other causes to potentially help the development of an early diagnostic tool. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate olfactory and trigeminal sensitivity and perception in PD patients and compare them to participants with non-parkinsonian OD (NPOD) and to healthy controls. METHODS: We assessed olfactory function using "Sniffin' Sticks test" and trigeminal function with the localization task in 28 PD patients, 27 healthy controls and 21 patients with OD unrelated to PD. RESULTS: PD patients exhibited significantly higher trigeminal sensitivity than NPOD patients (p = 0.002) and performed similar to healthy controls. In contrast, PD and NPOD patients had both similar olfactory scores, significantly below healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The trigeminal system seems not to be impaired in PD patients even in the presence of OD. Measuring trigeminal sensitivity may therefore allow to differentiate PD-related OD from other forms of OD.

28970540|t|Microstructural network alterations of olfactory dysfunction in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease.
28970540|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a robust and early sign for Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have revealed its association with dementia and related neural changes in PD. Yet, how olfactory dysfunction affects white matter (WM) microstructure in newly diagnosed and untreated PD remains unclear. Here we comprehensively examined WM features using unbiased whole-brain analyses. 88 newly diagnosed PD patients without dementia (70 with hyposmia and 18 without hyposmia) and 33 healthy controls underwent clinical assessment and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning. Tract-based special statistics (TBSS), graph-theoretic methods and network-based statistics (NBS) were used to compare regional and network-related WM features between groups. TBSS analysis did not show any differences in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity between groups. Compared with controls, PD patients without hyposmia showed a significant decrease in global efficiency, whilst PD patients with hyposmia exhibited significantly reduced global and local efficiency and additionally a disrupted connection between the right medial orbitofrontal cortex and left rectus and had poorer frontal-related cognitive functioning. These results demonstrate that hyposmia-related WM changes in early PD only occur at the network level. The confined disconnectivity between the bilateral olfactory circuitry may serve as a biomarker for olfactory dysfunction in early PD.

29550854|t|Parkinson disease in eldery patients: lessons from odour detection thresholds on olfacto-trigeminal interaction.
29550854|a|BACKGROUND: Human nasal chemosensation is mediated by two separate, though interacting sensory pathways: the trigeminal and olfactory systems. Trigeminal sensitivity and olfacto-trigeminal interactions have not yet been well studied in idiopathic Parkinsons disease (IPD). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess odour detection thresholds in elderly IPD patients, and compare them to the odour detection thresholds of healthy controls. Finally, we investigated potential interactions between trigeminal and olfactory sensitivity. METHODS: 89 IPD patients aged over 65 and 89 matched healthy participants were enrolled in the study. Odour detection thresholds to 3 stimuli differentially activating olfactory and trigeminal afferents (Phenyl-ethyl alcohol, n-Butanol and Pyridine) were assessed, using an ascending staircase, binary forced-choice procedure. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Detection threshold scores were able to discriminate between elderly IPD and controls. Pyridine was less effective than the two other odorants, suggesting that trigeminal pathway is less impaired than the olfactory system. We found that the detection thresholds were significantly different between IPD patients with good autonomy, and patients with impaired autonomy.

30488238|t|Incidence of Parkinson's disease in a large patient cohort with idiopathic smell and taste loss.
30488238|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients with idiopathic smell loss constitute an at-risk population for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The study aimed to follow up a large number of patients with idiopathic smell and/or taste loss to define the incidence of PD in this population and, further, to assess characteristics of both olfactory and gustatory function and their possible association with PD development. METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 833 patients diagnosed with an idiopathic smell disorder at our Smell and Taste Center during the last 15 years were contacted for a telephone interview. In 474 patients, a complete data set containing of demographic data, clinical information, retrospective smell and taste testing results, and telephone assessment was obtained. RESULTS: Out of 474 patients with idiopathic smell loss 45 (9.8%) had been diagnosed with PD, since they received the diagnosis of idiopathic smell and/or taste loss (mean 10.9 years after olfactory loss onset). Thus, with respect to the classification into olfactory/gustatory disorders, 28.6% of the patients with a combined olfactory and gustatory disorder developed PD, whereas in 9.9% of those with a pure olfactory disorder and in 3.8% of those with a pure gustatory disorder, PD was diagnosed. No association emerged between qualitative smell or taste loss and PD development. CONCLUSION: This large patient cohort study extends the previous literature, indicating that risk stratification might be considerably improved by correct diagnostic allocation and emphasizes the need for an exhaustive olfactory and gustatory assessment in specialized centers.

30911822|t|Olfaction and taste in Parkinson's disease: the association with mild cognitive impairment and the single cognitive domain dysfunction.
30911822|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and chemosensory dysfunction are non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but their association is unclear. We explored if MCI and the involvement of single cognitive domains influence olfaction and taste in PD. The role of demographic, clinical and neuropsychiatric variables was tested. We recruited 50 PD patients without dementia, no other reasons for cognitive impairment, no condition that could influence evaluation of cognition, olfaction and taste. They underwent a full neuropsychological and chemosensory (i.e., olfaction and taste) test with the Sniffin' Sticks Extended test (SSET), Whole Mouth test (WMT) and Taste Strips test (TST). Fifty age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Olfactory function and sweet identification were worse in PD than controls. MCI negatively influenced odor identification. Factors associated with poor olfactory function were age, overall cognition, apathy, and visuospatial dysfunction. Sour identification was affected by MCI and executive dysfunction, and salty identification by executive dysfunction. MCI, age and executive dysfunction worsened TST score. Awareness of olfactory dysfunction was impaired in PD with MCI. Education positively influenced SSET and TST scores. Our data confirmed that olfaction is abnormal in PD, while taste was only slightly impaired. Olfaction was worse in PD patients with visuospatial dysfunction, while sour and salty identification was worse in those with MCI and executive dysfunction, suggesting different underlying anatomical abnormalities. Future studies should incorporate neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid data to confirm this hypothesis. SSET odor identification and TST sour identification could be explored as quick screening tests for PD-MCI.

31011798|t|Olfactory anosognosia is a predictor of cognitive decline and dementia conversion in Parkinson's disease.
31011798|a|OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are often unaware of olfactory deficits despite having hyposmia from the early stages. We aimed to evaluate whether olfactory anosognosia is a predictor of cognitive decline in PD. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we recruited 77 PD patients who underwent both olfactory and neuropsychological tests and were followed-up for over 5 years. Based on the degree of olfactory dysfunction and awareness of its presence, patients were classified as normosmic patients (Normosmia group, n = 15), hyposmic patients without olfactory anosognosia (Hyposmia-OA-, n = 40), or hyposmic patients with olfactory anosognosia (Hyposmia-OA+, n = 22). We compared the rates of cognitive decline using linear mixed model and dementia conversion using a survival analysis among the groups. RESULTS: A higher proportion of patients in the Hyposmia-OA+ group had mild cognitive impairment at baseline (77.3%) and dementia converter at follow-up (50.0%). The Hyposmia-OA+ group exhibited a faster decline in frontal executive and global cognitive function than did the Normosmia and Hyposmia-OA- groups. A Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the conversion rate to dementia was significantly higher in the Hyposmia-OA+ group than in the Normosmia (P = 0.007) and Hyposmia-OA- (P = 0.038) groups. A Cox regression analysis showed that olfactory anosognosia remained a significant predictor of time to develop dementia in the Hyposmia-OA+ group compared to the Normosmia group (adjusted hazard ratio 3.30; 95% confidence interval 1.10-8.21). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that olfactory anosognosia is a predictor of cognitive decline and dementia conversion in PD.

31506174|t|Three-year prospective study on olfaction of patients with Parkinson's disease.
31506174|a|OBJECTIVE: We conducted a 3-year prospective study on olfaction of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in order to examine the severity and frequency of smell disorder in PD using odor identification test, Open Essence (OE) and to verify the validity of olfactory tests as a predictor of cognitive symptom onset of PD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study by performing an annual examination over a 3-year period. For 56 cases diagnosed with PD by the Department of Neurology at our hospital, OE and Jet Stream Olfactometry (JSO) were performed to assess the olfactory function, and Mini-Mental-State Examination (MMSE) was conducted to measure cognitive impairment. RESULTS: At the beginning, 56 cases were examined, of which 42 remained to be followed up for 3 years. Based on the results of baseline, we found a correlation between OE and the average cognitive thresholds of JSO, but did not find any correlation between OE and MMSE. OE (median 4.0 4.0) and the average cognitive thresholds of JSO (median 2.2 1.6) decreased after 3 years, and MMSE (median 29 29) also declined, but not significantly. At the 3rd year, 6 cases with MMSE score of 23 or less were identified as suspected dementia and 36 cases with more than 24 points were defined as an invariant group. In order to distinguish these two groups, OE scores of baselines were evaluated with a combination of 12 odors. Sensitivity 1.0 and specificity 0.722 were obtained and the sensitivity+specificity value (1.722) was the highest when the number of correct answers was 4 or less using an odor combination of lumber, menthol, Japanese orange, gas for household use, Hinoki cypress and condensed milk. CONCLUSION: When the number of correct answers of 6 odors (lumber, menthol, Japanese orange, gas for household use, Hinoki cypress and condensed milk) is 4 or less in patients with PD, there is a possibility that MMSE declines in 3 years.

31595376|t|Olfactory and gustatory functioning and food preferences of patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment compared to controls: the NUDAD project.
31595376|a|Our aim is to compare olfactory and gustatory function and food preferences of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) with controls. We included 22 patients with MCI, 30 patients with AD and 40 controls and assessed olfactory threshold, odor discrimination and odor identification (Sniffin' Sticks), gustatory functioning (Taste Strips), and food preferences (Macronutrient and Taste Preference Ranking Task). Linear regression analyses were used to study associations of five cognitive domains or AD biomarkers with olfactory functioning. Groups did not differ in olfactory threshold, gustatory function and food preferences. Patients with MCI and AD scored lower on odor discrimination and identification than controls. Poorer memory, but no other cognitive domain, was associated with poorer odor discrimination and odor identification, but not with odor threshold. No associations with AD biomarkers were found. In conclusion, patients with MCI and AD have poorer odor discrimination and identification ability than controls, but similar detection thresholds. This is likely a consequence of poorer memory rather than directly caused by AD pathology.

31894565|t|Impact of the severity of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease on the gustatory sensitivity of older persons.
31894565|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the severity of dementia and taste recognition abilities in older persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Anthropometric measurements were performed and body mass index was used to determine the nutritional status. The taste strips were used to test gustatory functions of the five basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami). RESULTS: A total of 30 healthy younger subjects, 30 healthy older subjects, 37 with mild stage AD and 23 with moderate stage AD were recruited. The older subjects with moderate AD showed a significant reduction of taste, less recognition of bitter and salty taste (score: 10.6 +- 2.6; 2.6 +- 0.9; 1.7 +- 1.5) when compared to older people without cognitive impairment (score: 13.3 +- 1.8; 3.4 +- 0.9; 3.2 +- 0.9), and less recognition of sweet taste (score: 2.9 +- 1.2) when compared to subjects with mild stage AD (score: 3.6 +- 0.8). Impaired recognition of salty taste was detected since the early stages of AD. Among the factors that possibly influence gustatory function, a significant correlation was detected between taste ability and age, medication intake, mini-mental state examination and the nutritional status. CONCLUSION: The severity of dementia is directly associated with greater impairment of taste sensitivity, especially among older subjects with moderate stage disease.

31945302|t|Validation of Iranian Smell Identification Test for screening of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
31945302|a|BACKGROUND: According to the World Alzheimer Report 2019, an estimated 50 million people worldwide are living with dementia. The smell test is a method for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an inexpensive, simple, and noninvasive screening tool. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the Iran Smell Identification Test (Iran-SIT) in discriminating patients with AD, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the healthy subjects. METHODS: In this study, 42 patients with AD, 33 with MCI, and 32 healthy controls were recruited from the referral Memory Clinic of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The olfactory function was examined with six odors through Iran-SIT. RESULTS: We found a significant difference among the olfactory function in subjects with normal cognitive status, that of those with MCI and those with AD (p < 0.001). The cutoff point for the diagnosis of AD was (sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 85.7 and 90.8%), and (Sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 93.9 and 100%) for MCI. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Iran-SIT is a valid biomarker and practical screening tool, with simple, inexpensive, and readily available for use in combination with neuropsychological tools and neuroimaging for early detection of AD.

32989104|t|Longitudinal change in dopamine transporter availability in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.
32989104|a|OBJECTIVE: To elucidate longitudinal changes in the dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in association with the prodromal markers in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), we analyzed a longitudinal prospective iRBD cohort data. METHOD: The study cohort consisted of patients with iRBD, individuals with Parkinson disease (PD), and healthy controls. All participants were evaluated for olfaction, neuropsychological tests, and the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and underwent 18F-FP-CIT PET scans every 2 years. We calculated the DAT pattern by performing the principal component analysis of tracer uptakes in 6 striatal regions. RESULT: DAT patterns in patients with iRBD with baseline hyposmia, constipation, and mild parkinsonian signs distributed toward the PD pattern and clearly distinguished from the healthy control pattern. The DAT pattern moved toward the PD pattern over time in some patients with iRBD during the follow-up, and baseline hyposmia was the only biomarker significantly associated with this change. Baseline PD pattern of DAT predicted 58% of disease converters (hazard ratio 4.95 [95% confidence interval 1.16-21.08]). The combination of hyposmia and baseline PD pattern of DAT predicted 67% of the conversion (hazard ratio 7.89 [confidence interval 1.85-33.69]). The estimated sample size required for a simulated neuroprotective clinical trial was 63 per group when the annual change of DAT pattern was used as an outcome in the subgroup with baseline DAT PD pattern and hyposmia, which is the smallest number reported so far. CONCLUSION: Baseline and longitudinal monitoring of the DAT pattern can be a useful biomarker in identifying individuals with a high risk of disease conversion and in selecting the potential population for clinical trials in iRBD.

33189129|t|Correlations of apathy with clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and olfactory dysfunctions: a cross-sectional study.
33189129|a|BACKGROUND: Apathy is one of the most common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, correlations of apathy with demographic variables, cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric symptoms, activity of daily living and olfactory functions in AD patients are still lacking comprehensive investigations. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. Total 124 typical AD patients were consecutively recruited from April 2014 to April 2017. In 124 AD patients, 47 cases (37.9%) were male and 77 cases were female; patients' age were 43-93 years with an average of 68 years. Patients were divided into AD with apathy (AD-A) and AD with no apathy (AD-NA) groups according to the score of Modified Apathy Evaluation Scale, then were evaluated cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric symptoms and activity of daily living, and tested olfactory functions. Above variables were compared between AD-A and AD-NA groups. Further correlation analyses and linear regression analysis were performed between apathy and above variables. RESULTS: Compared with AD-NA group, global cognitive level, verbal memory, verbal fluency and activity of daily living were significantly compromised in AD-A group (P < 0.002); depression and agitation were severely displayed in AD-A group (P < 0.002). Apathy was negatively correlated with global cognitive function, verbal memory, verbal fluency and activity of daily living (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference of olfactory functions between the two groups (P > 0.002), and correlations between apathy and olfactory threshold, olfactory identification and global olfactory function were significant (P < 0.05) but quite weak ( r  < 0.3). Further linear regression analysis showed that only verbal fluency and instrumental activities of daily living were independently associated with apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Independent correlations among apathy, verbal fluency and instrumental activities of daily living in AD patients might be related to the common brain area involved in their pathogeneses.

33215598|t|Characterisation of patients with idiopathic olfactory dysfunction and plan for clinical follow-up.
33215598|a|INTRODUCTION: Characterisation and management of olfactory dysfunction (OD) can be challenging, especially in patients diagnosed with idiopathic OD. This group of patients is at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, wherefore appropriate guidelines for management of OD are needed. We aimed to identify and characterise patients suffering from idiopathic hyposmia/anosmia. METHODS: This prospective study included 515 consecutive patients referred to the Flavour Clinic, Holstebro, Denmark. Patients with idiopathic, sino-nasal or post-infectious OD were compared with regards to symptoms and clinical findings including endoscopy of the upper airways, sino-nasal CT, allergy testing, and olfactory and gustatory assessment. RESULTS: Patients with idiopathic OD were older and a preponderance of females was observed compared with the sino-nasal group (p = 0.0302, and p = 0.0549, respectively). The OD group had a lower prevalence of allergy and longer symptom duration than both the sino-nasal and the post-infectious groups (p Less than 0.0001 and p = 0.0014; p less than 0.0001 and p less than 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from idiopathic OD were predominantly females with a long symptom duration. Only few of these patients suffered from allergies or sino-nasal pathologies. Patient history, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test and threshold discrimination identification scores from the Extended Sniffin Sticks test are the most valuable clinical tools for diagnosing the aetiology behind OD. An ideal workup for idiopathic OD is presented. FUNDING: none. TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.

33361601|t|Olfactory Dysfunction Is Already Present with Subjective Cognitive Decline and Deepens with Disease Severity in the Alzheimer's Disease Spectrum.
33361601|a|BACKGROUND: Odor identification dysfunction occurs early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is considered a preclinical symptom along with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Nevertheless, whether subjects with SCD are co-symptomatic with odor identification dysfunction remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the degree of odor identification dysfunction and assess the relation between odor identification and cognitive performance in the AD spectrum (including SCD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD). METHODS: Patients (84 SCD, 129 MCI, 52 AD) and 35 controls underwent the Sniffin' Sticks Screen 16 test and comprehensive neuropsychological examination. RESULTS: Odor identification scores were progressively lower moving from normal older adult to SCD, MCI, and AD. Additionally,the proportion of odor identification dysfunction were increasingly higher in the AD spectrum (p for trend <0.001), but no significant difference was found in the proportion of subjective olfactory dysfunction. No significant correlation was found between odor identification and cognition in the normal older adults and SCD subjects, but odor identification correlated with global cognition in the MCI (r = 0.199, p = 0.033) and in the AD (r = 0.300, p = 0.036) patients. Multiple linear regression showed that odor identification dysfunction was most strongly associated with memory among different cognitive subdomains and was most strongly associated with immediate verbal recall among different memory subdomains. CONCLUSION: Odor identification dysfunction is already present with SCD and deepens with disease severity in the AD spectrum, and it may contribute to predicting cognitive decline and identifying SCD subjects who are at risk of developing AD.

33781923|t|Anticipatory human subthalamic area beta-band power responses to dissociable tastes correlate with weight gain.
33781923|a|The availability of enticing sweet, fatty tastes is prevalent in the modern diet and contribute to overeating and obesity. In animal models, the subthalamic area plays a role in mediating appetitive and consummatory feeding behaviors, however, its role in human feeding is unknown. We used intraoperative, subthalamic field potential recordings while participants (n = 5) engaged in a task designed to provoke responses of taste anticipation and receipt. Decreased subthalamic beta-band (15-30 Hz) power responses were observed for both sweet-fat and neutral tastes. Anticipatory responses to taste-neutral cues started with an immediate decrease in beta-band power from baseline followed by an early beta-band rebound above baseline. On the contrary, anticipatory responses to sweet-fat were characterized by a greater and sustained decrease in beta-band power. These activity patterns were topographically specific to the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra. Further, a neural network trained on this beta-band power signal accurately predicted (AUC >= 74%) single trials corresponding to either taste. Finally, the magnitude of the beta-band rebound for a neutral taste was associated with increased body mass index after starting deep brain stimulation therapy. We provide preliminary evidence of discriminatory taste encoding within the subthalamic area associated with control mechanisms that mediate appetitive and consummatory behaviors.

33843686|t|Olfactory Phenotypes Differentiate Cognitively Unimpaired Seniors from Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Combined Machine Learning and Traditional Statistical Approach.
33843686|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, olfactory testing is not commonly performed to test OD in the setting of AD. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates objective OD as a non-invasive biomarker for accurately classifying subjects as cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. METHODS: Patients with MCI (n = 24) and AD (n = 24), and CU (n = 33) controls completed two objective tests of olfaction (Affordable, Rapid, Olfactory Measurement Array -AROMA; Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 Test -SST12). Demographic and subjective sinonasal and olfaction symptom information was also obtained. Analyses utilized traditional statistics and machine learning to determine olfactory variables, and combinations of variables, of importance for differentiating normal and disease states. RESULTS: Inability to correctly identify a scent after detection was a hallmark of MCI/AD. AROMA was superior to SST12 for differentiating MCI from AD. Performance on the clove scent was significantly different between all three groups. AROMA regression modeling yielded six scents with AUC of the ROC of 0.890 (p < 0.001). Random forest model machine learning algorithms considering AROMA olfactory data successfully predicted MCI versus AD disease state. Considering only AROMA data, machine learning algorithms were 87.5%accurate (95%CI 0.4735, 0.9968). Sensitivity and specificity were 100%and 75%, respectively with ROC of 0.875. When considering AROMA and subject demographic and subjective data, the AUC of the ROC increased to 0.9375. CONCLUSION: OD differentiates CUs from those with MCI and AD and can accurately predict MCI versus AD. Leveraging OD data may meaningfully guide management and research decisions.

34014391|t|Hyposmia may predict development of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.
34014391|a|To explore the effect of olfactory dysfunction on treatment of motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD). The current longitudinal retrospective cohort study consecutively recruited 108 de novo PD patients. Of whom 29 were normosmia and 79 were hyposmia, respectively, which was determined by the Korean Version of Sniffin' Sticks Test II at the time of diagnosis. All the participants underwent serial clinical examinations including Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Mini-Mental State Examination, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The normosmic group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction of the UPDRS III score (30.3 +- 5.9 to 21.9 +- 5.1) than that of the hyposmic group (34.5 +- 9.3 to 28.5 +- 8.1) from baseline to 1-year later (p, 0.003; Bonferroni correction for p < 0.0045). Of subdomains in UPDRS III, the axial domain revealed a remarkable decrease in the normosmic group. Further, the hyposmic group exhibited a higher development rate of freezing of gait (FOG) compared to the normosmic group (29/79 (36.7%) vs 2/29 (6.9%); p, 0.002) during 33.9 +- 7.7 months of the mean follow-up period. A Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated the hyposmia to be a significant risk factor for the future development of FOG (HR, 4.23; 95% CI 1.180-17.801; p, 0.05). Our data demonstrated the olfactory dysfunction to be a significant risk factor for the development of the FOG in PD. Hyposmic PD patients should be paid more careful attention to the occurrence of FOG in the clinical practice.

34180422|t|Slow Motion Analysis of Repetitive Tapping (SMART) Test: Measuring Bradykinesia in Recently Diagnosed Parkinson's Disease and Idiopathic Anosmia.
34180422|a|BACKGROUND: Bradykinesia is the defining motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). There are limitations to its assessment using standard clinical rating scales, especially in the early stages of PD when a floor effect may be observed. OBJECTIVE: To develop a quantitative method to track repetitive tapping movements and to compare people in the early stages of PD, healthy controls, and individuals with idiopathic anosmia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 99 participants (early-stage PD = 26, controls = 64, idiopathic anosmia = 9). For each participant, repetitive finger tapping was recorded over 20 seconds using a smartphone at 240 frames per second. From each video, amplitude between fingers, frequency (number of taps per second), and velocity (distance travelled per second) was extracted. Clinical assessment was based on the motor section of the MDS-UPDRS. RESULTS: People in the early stage of PD performed the task with slower velocity (p < 0.001) and with greater frequency slope than controls (p = 0.003). The combination of reduced velocity and greater frequency slope obtained the best accuracy to separate early-stage PD from controls based on metric thresholds alone (AUC = 0.88). Individuals with anosmia exhibited slower velocity (p = 0.001) and smaller amplitude (p < 0.001) compared with controls. CONCLUSION: We present a simple, proof-of-concept method to detect early motor dysfunction in PD. Mean tap velocity appeared to be the best parameter to differentiate patients with PD from controls. Patients with anosmia also showed detectable differences in motor performance compared with controls which may suggest that some were in the prodromal phase of PD.

34190430|t|Comparison between four published definitions of hyposmia in Parkinson's disease.
34190430|a|OBJECTIVES: Hyposmia is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet there is no standard method to define it. A comparison of four published methods was performed to explore and highlight differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Olfactory testing was performed in 2097 cases of early PD in two prospective studies. Olfaction was assessed using various cut-offs, usually corrected by age and/or gender. Control data were simulated based on the age and gender structure of the PD cases and published normal ranges. Association with age, gender, and disease duration was explored by method and study cohort. Prevalence of hyposmia was compared with the age and gender-matched simulated controls. Between method agreement was measured using Cohen's kappa and Gwet's AC1. RESULTS: Hyposmia was present in between 69.1% and 97.9% of cases in Tracking Parkinson's cases, and between 62.2% and 90.8% of cases in the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative, depending on the method. Between-method agreement varied (kappa 0.09-0.80, AC1 0.55-0.86). The absolute difference between PD cases and simulated controls was similar for men and women across methods. Age and male gender were positively associated with hyposmia (p < .001, all methods). Odds of having hyposmia increased with advancing age (OR:1.06, 95% CI:1.03, 1.10, p < .001). Longer disease duration had a negative impact on overall olfactory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Different definitions of hyposmia give different results using the same dataset. A standardized definition of hyposmia in PD is required, adjusting for age and gender, to account for the background decline in olfactory performance with ageing, especially in men.

34549475|t|Diet enriched in omega-3 fatty acids alleviates olfactory system deficits in APOE4 transgenic mice.
34549475|a|Olfactory dysfunction is observed in several neurological disorders including Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). These deficits occur early and correlate with global cognitive performance, depression and degeneration of olfactory regions in the brain. Despite extensive human studies, there has been little characterization of the olfactory system in models of AD. In order to determine if olfactory structural and/or molecular phenotypes are observed in a model expressing a genetic risk factor for AD, we assessed the olfactory bulb (OB) in APOE4 transgenic mice. A significant decrease in OB weight was observed at 12 months of age in APOE4 mice concurrent with inflammation and decreased NeuN expression. In order to determine if a diet rich in omega-3s may alleviate the olfactory system phenotypes observed, we assessed WT and APOE4 mice on a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diet. APOE4 mice on a DHA diet did not present with atrophy of the OB, and the alterations in NeuN and IBA-1 expression were alleviated. Furthermore, alterations in caspase mRNA and protein expression in the APOE4 OB were not observed with a DHA diet. Similar to the human AD condition, OB atrophy is an early phenotype in the APOE4 mice and concurrent with inflammation. These data support a link between the structural olfactory brain region atrophy and the olfactory dysfunction observed in AD and suggest that inflammation and cell death pathways may contribute to the olfactory deficits observed. Furthermore, the results suggest that diets enriched in DHA may provide benefit to APOE4 allele carriers.

35398594|t|Possible role of endocannabinoids in olfactory and taste dysfunctions in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients and volumetric changes in the brain.
35398594|a|The purpose of this study is to determine the volumes of primary brain regions associated with smell and taste in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients and healthy controls using MR imaging and examine volumetric changes in comparison to smell/taste questionnaire and test results and endocannabinoid (EC) levels. The study included 15 AD patients with mild cognitive dysfunction scored as 18 <= MMSE <= 23, 15 PD patients with scores of 18 < MoCA < 26 and 18 <= MMSE <= 23, and 15 healthy controls. A taste and smell questionnaire was given to the participants, and their taste and smell statuses were examined using the Sniffin' Sticks smell identification test and Burghart Taste Strips. EC levels were analyzed in the blood serum samples of the participants using the ELISA method. The volumes of the left olfactory bulb (p = 0.001), left amygdala (p = 0.004), left hippocampus (p = 0.008), and bilateral insula (left p = 0.000, right p = 0.000) were significantly smaller in the Alzheimer's patients than the healthy controls. The volumes of the left olfactory bulb (p = 0.001) and left hippocampus (p = 0.009) were significantly smaller in the Parkinson's patients than the healthy controls. A significant correlation was determined between volume reduction in the left Rolandic operculum cortical region and taste dysfunction. EC levels were significantly higher in both AD (p = 0.000) and PD (p = 0.006) in comparison to the controls. Our results showed that volumetric changes occur in the brain regions associated with smell and taste in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients. It was observed that ECs played a role in these volumetric changes and the olfactory and taste dysfunctions of the patients.

35767550|t|Odor identification predicts the transition of patients with isolated RBD: A retrospective study.
35767550|a|INTRODUCTION: To determine if the severity of olfactory dysfunction in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) predicts conversion to Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: Olfaction was tested using the Japanese version of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-J) in 155 consecutive patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD and 34 healthy controls. IRBD patients were followed up for 5.8 +- 3.2 (range 0.2-11) years. Thirty-eight patients underwent repeat UPSIT-J evaluation at 2.7 +- 1.3 years after the baseline test. RESULTS: UPSIT-J score was lower in IRBD patients than in age- and sex-matched controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cutoff score of 22.5 in UPSIT-J discriminated between IRBD patients and controls with a sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 81.8%. Anosmia (UPSIT-J score < 19) was present in 54.2% of IRBD patients. In total, 42 patients developed a neurodegenerative disease, of whom 17 had PD, 22 DLB, and 3 MSA. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the short-term risk of Lewy body disease (LBD) was higher in patients with anosmia than in those without anosmia. At baseline, the UPSIT-J score was similar between patients who developed PD and DLB (p = 0.136). All three IRBD patients (100%) who developed MSA did not have anosmia. CONCLUSIONS: In IRBD patients, anosmia predicts a higher short-term risk of transition to LBD but cannot distinguish between PD and DLB. At baseline, preserved odor identification may occur in latent MSA. Future IRBD neuroprotective trials should evaluate anosmia as a marker of prodromal LBD.

35908177|t|D2/D3 Receptor Agonism: Paving the Way for a New Therapeutic Target for Taste Disorders in Parkinson's Disease and Other Conditions?
35908177|a|Chemosensory (i.e., olfaction and taste) dysfunction is common in neurodegenerative (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia), psychiatric (e.g., depression, bipolar disorders, other conditions), and postinfectious (i.e., long COVID) diseases and in the elderly. Despite its impact on patients' quality of life, no established treatment for taste disorders exists so far. A recent report on the effect of pramipexole, a D2/D3 agonist, on taste performance in healthy participants provides support for a new potential therapeutic target for taste dysfunction to be tested in future randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials across several populations reporting gustatory symptoms.

35995594|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is clinical and phenotypic heterogeneity in LRRK2 G2019S Parkinson disease (PD), including loss of smell. Olfactory scores have defined subgroups of LRRK2 PD at baseline. We now extend this work longitudinally to better determine features associated with olfactory classes and to gain further insight into this heterogeneity. METHODS: Evaluation of 162 patients with LRRK2 PD and 198 patients with idiopathic PD (IPD) from the LRRK2 Ashkenazi Jewish Consortium was performed, with follow-up available for 92 patients with LRRK2 PD and 74 patients with IPD. Olfaction (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT]), motor function (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale), and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), as well as sleep, nonmotor, and mood, were measured. Gaussian mixture models were applied on the UPSIT percentile score to determine subgroups based on olfactory performance. Linear mixed effects models, using PD duration as the time scale, assessed the relationship between UPSIT subgroup membership and motor/cognitive change. RESULTS: Baseline olfaction was better in LRRK2 PD compared with IPD (mean UPSIT +- SD: 24.2 +- 8.8 vs 18.9 +- 7.6), with higher mean percentile scores (difference: 15.3 +- 11.6) (p < 0.001) and less frequent hyposmia (55.6% vs 85.4%; p < 0.001). Analysis suggested 3 classes among LRRK2 PD. Age at onset in LRRK2 PD was earlier in the worst olfaction group (group 1), compared with groups 2 and 3 (54.5 +- 11.1 vs 61.7 +- 9.3) (p = 0.012), and separately in the hyposmic group overall (55.0 +- 11.3 vs 61.7 +- 9.1) (p < 0.001). Longitudinal motor deterioration in LRRK2 PD was also significantly faster in the worst UPSIT group than the best UPSIT group (group 3 vs group 1: B = 0.31, SE = 0.35 vs B = 0.96, SE = 0.28) (rate difference = -0.65, SE = 0.29) (p = 0.03). However, olfactory group membership was not significantly associated with cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: In this large LRRK2 cohort with longitudinal analysis, we extend prior work demonstrating subgroups defined by olfaction in LRRK2 G2019S PD and show that the worst olfaction group has earlier age at PD onset and more rapid motor decline. This supports a subgroup of LRRK2 PD that might show more rapid change in a clinical trial of LRRK2-related agents and highlights the need to integrate careful phenotyping into allocation schema in clinical trials of LRRK2-related agents. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that worse olfactory scores were associated with an earlier age at symptomatic onset and a faster rate of motor deterioration in patients with LRRK2 PD.

36002254|t|Analysis of Diagnostic Value of Electrogastrography for Parkinson's Disease and its Predictive Value for the Disease Progression.
36002254|a|The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of indexes detected by electrogastrography in Parkinson's disease patients. One hundred twenty early Parkinson's disease patients and 120 healthy controls were recruited, and underwent electrogastrography to detect dominant frequency (DF), instability coefficient of DF (ICDF), low frequency range (LFR), high frequency range (HFR), and normal frequency range (NFR). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn for the diagnostic value analysis. The motor function was scored with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Sniffin' Sticks test was used for the olfactory evaluation, and the TDI score consisting of odor threshold (T), odor discrimination (D) and odor identification (I) tests was calculated. The preprandial ICDF of Parkinson's disease patients was significantly higher than that of the control group, and decreased slowly during the late postprandial phase. The levels of LFR%, HFR% and NFR% in Parkinson's disease patients were higher than the control group during both the preprandial and late postprandial phase, and the changes of each index before and after meals were not obvious. Preprandial ICDF value and TDI score had the ability to distinguish Parkinson's disease patients with the AUC of 0.874 and 0.859 respectively. The ICDF detected by electrogastrography has high clinical value in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and the combination of ICDF and TDI can improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a single indicator. High ICDF levels during the preprandial phase are related to the poor prognosis of Parkinson's disease patients after treatment.

36098886|t|REM sleep behavior disorder correlates with constipation in de novo Chinese Parkinson's disease patients.
36098886|a|BACKGROUND: Constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and hyposmia are common prodromal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), and they may represent two distinct types of disease origin, from the body or the brain. Our study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of de novo PD patients with and without constipation and identify which prodromal symptoms were associated with constipation. METHODS: A total of 111 de novo, drug-naive Chinese PD patients were consecutively enrolled from Jan 2017 to Sept 2021. Patients were classified into PD with and without constipation based on item 5 of the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Autonomic Dysfunction (SCOPA-AUT). The demographic data, motor, and non-motor symptoms were compared between the two groups. The associated factors of constipation were analyzed by the multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 44.1% (n = 49) of de novo PD patients had constipation. PD patients with constipation were older (p = 0.028), had higher proportions of Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage [Formula: see text] 2 (p = 0.002), clinical possible RBD (cpRBD) (p = 0.002) and depression (p = 0.023), as well as marginal increase of hyposmia (p = 0.058) and freezing of gait (p = 0.069). After adjusting for H-Y stage and other confounding factors, cpRBD (OR = 3.508, p = 0.009), rather than hyposmia or depression, was closely related to constipation in de novo Chinese PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: RBD is closely associated with constipation in de novo Chinese PD patients. Our results support the theory that prodromal symptoms that represent the same pathological origin are closely related to each other.

36401656|t|Screening performances of an 8-item UPSIT Italian version in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
36401656|a|Hyposmia is a common finding in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is usually tested through the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The aim of our study is to provide a briefer version of the Italian-adapted UPSIT test, able to discriminate between PD patients and healthy subjects (HS). By means of several univariate and multivariate (machine-learning-based) statistical approaches, we selected 8 items by which we trained a partial-least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and a decision tree (DT) model: class predictions of both models performed better with the 8-item version when compared to the 40-item version. An area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve built with the selected 8 odors showed the best performance (sensitivity 86.8%, specificity 82%) in predicting the PD condition at a cut-off point of <= 6. These performances were higher than those previously calculated for the 40-item UPSIT test (sensitivity 82% and specificity 88.2 % with a cut-off point of <= 21). Qualitatively, our selection contains one odor (i.e., apple) which is Italian-specific, supporting the need for cultural adaptation of smell testing; on the other hand, some of the selected best discriminating odors are in common with existing brief smell test versions validated on PD patients of other cultures, supporting the view that disease-specific odor patterns may exist and deserve a further evaluation.

36460474|t|Associations of Olfaction With Longitudinal Trajectories of Brain Volumes and Neuropsychological Function in Older Adults.
36460474|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Olfactory function declines with aging, and olfactory deficits are one of the earliest features of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Previous studies have shown that olfaction is associated with brain volumes and cognitive function, but data are exclusively cross-sectional. We aimed to examine longitudinal associations of olfaction with changes in brain volumes and neuropsychological function. METHODS: In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we chose the first assessment of olfaction to examine the associations with retrospective and prospective changes in neuropsychological performance and brain volumes in participants aged 50 years or older using linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for demographic variables and cardiovascular disease. Olfaction was measured as odor identification scores through the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 567 (58% women, 42% men, 27% Black, 66% White, and 7% others) participants who had data on odor identification scores and brain volumetric MRI (n = 420 with retrospective repeats over a mean of 3.7 years, n = 280 with prospective repeats over a mean of 1.2 years). We also analyzed data from 754 participants (56% women, 44% men, 29% Black, 65% White, and 6% others) with neuropsychological assessments (n = 630 with retrospective repeats over a mean of 6.6 years, n = 280 with prospective repeats over a mean of 1.5 years). After adjustment, higher odor identification scores were associated with prior and subsequent slower brain atrophy in the entorhinal cortex (beta +- SE = 0.0093 +- 0.0031, p = 0.0028 and beta +- SE = 0.0176 +- 0.0073, p = 0.0169, respectively), hippocampus (beta +- SE = 0.0070 +- 0.0030, p = 0.0192 and beta +- SE = 0.0173 +- 0.0066, p = 0.0089, respectively), and additional frontal and temporal areas (all p < 0.05). Higher odor identification scores were also associated with prior slower decline in memory, attention, processing speed, and manual dexterity and subsequent slower decline in attention (all p < 0.05). Some associations were attenuated after exclusion of data points at and after symptom onset of cognitive impairment or dementia. DISCUSSION: In older adults, olfaction is related to brain atrophy of specific brain regions and neuropsychological changes in specific domains over time. The observed associations are driven, in part, by those who developed cognitive impairment or dementia. Future longitudinal studies with longer follow-ups are needed to understand whether olfactory decline precedes cognitive decline and whether it is mediated through regionally specific brain atrophy.

36755296|t|Sex-divergent effects on the NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin signaling across the olfactory-entorhinal-amygdaloid axis in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
36755296|a|BACKGROUND: Smell impairment is one of the earliest features in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD). Due to sex differences exist in terms of smell and olfactory structures as well as in the prevalence and manifestation of both neurological syndromes, we have applied olfactory proteomics to favor the discovery of novel sex-biased physio-pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets associated with olfactory dysfunction. METHODS: SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry) and bioinformatic workflows were applied in 57 post-mortem olfactory tracts (OT) derived from controls with no known neurological history (n = 6F/11M), AD (n = 4F/13M) and PD (n = 7F/16M) subjects. Complementary molecular analyses by Western-blotting were performed in the olfactory bulb (OB), entorhinal cortex (EC) and amygdala areas. RESULTS: 327 and 151 OT differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were observed in AD women and AD men, respectively (35 DEPs in common). With respect to PD, 198 DEPs were identified in PD women, whereas 95 DEPs were detected in PD men (20 DEPs in common). This proteome dyshomeostasis induced a disruption in OT protein interaction networks and widespread sex-dependent pathway perturbations in a disease-specific manner, among them Sirtuin (SIRT) signaling. SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT5 protein levels unveiled a tangled expression profile across the olfactory-entorhinal-amygdaloid axis, evidencing disease-, sex- and brain structure-dependent changes in olfactory protein acetylation. CONCLUSIONS: Alteration in the OT proteostasis was more severe in AD than in PD. Moreover, protein expression changes were more abundant in women than men independent of the neurological syndrome. Mechanistically, the tangled SIRT profile observed across the olfactory pathway-associated brain regions in AD and PD indicates differential NAD (+)-dependent deacetylase mechanisms between women and men. All these data shed new light on differential olfactory mechanisms across AD and PD, pointing out that the evaluation of the feasibility of emerging sirtuin-based therapies against neurodegenerative diseases should be considered with caution, including further sex dimension analyses in vivo and in clinical studies.

37027897|t|Odor identification errors reveal cognitive aspects of age-associated smell loss.
37027897|a|Human olfaction can be extraordinarily sensitive, and its most common assessment method is odor identification (OID), where everyday odors are matched to word labels in a multiple-choice format. However, many older persons are unable to identify familiar odors, a deficit that is associated with the risk of future dementia and mortality. The underlying processes subserving OID in older adults are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed error patterns in OID to test whether errors could be explained by perceptual and/or semantic similarities among the response alternatives. We investigated the OID response patterns in a large, population-based sample of older adults in Sweden (n = 2479; age 60-100 years). Olfaction was assessed by a 'Sniffin  TOM OID test with 16 odors; each trial involved matching a target odor to a correct label among three distractors. We analyzed the pattern of misidentifications, and the results showed that some distractors were more frequently selected than others, suggesting cognitive or perceptual factors may be present. Relatedly, we conducted a large online survey of older adults (n = 959, age 60-90 years) who were asked to imagine and rate the perceptual similarity of the target odors and the three corresponding distractors (e.g. "How similar are these smells: apple and mint?"). We then used data from the Swedish web corpus and the Word2Vec neural network algorithm to quantify the semantic association strength between the labels of each target odor and its three distractors. These data sources were used to predict odor identification errors. We found that the error patterns were partly explained by both the semantic similarity between target-distractor pairs, and the imagined perceptual similarity of the target-distractor pair. Both factors had, however, a diminished prediction in older ages, as responses became gradually less systematic. In sum, our results suggest that OID tests not only reflect olfactory perception, but also likely involve the mental processing of odor-semantic associations. This may be the reason why these tests are useful in predicting dementia onset. Our insights into olfactory-language interactions could be harnessed to develop new olfactory tests that are tailored for specific clinical purposes.

37046132|t|RBD and hyposmia in Moroccan patients with a synucleinopathy: prevalence and the timing of occurrence in a large cohort.
37046132|a|INTRODUCTION: Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) and hyposmia are common in synucleinopathies and they tend to occur in connection to the prodromal development of these disorders. In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence of RBD and hyposmia and the timeline of their occurrence in a large cohort of Moroccan patients. METHODS: We recruited 734 consecutive patients with synucleinopathy and tauopathy at Ibn Rochd University Hospital of Casablanca. A group of 100 healthy controls was also recruited. We relied on a questionnaire to collect general characteristics and clinical data filled by the patient and his companion under the supervision of a qualified health professional. RESULTS: The study included 697 patients with PD, 37 with DLB and 10 had a tauopathy disorder (PSP or CBD). The proportion of patients who have RBD was 52% in PD, 100% in DLB, 0% in tauopathies and 12% among healthy controls. Hyposmia symptom was found in 47% of patients with PD, 68% in patients with DLB, 0% in tauopathy patients and in 10% of healthy controls. Moreover, 46% of PD patients and 75% of DLB patients developed RBD during the prodromal phase. Meanwhile, hyposmia occurred in association with the prodromal phase among 67% of PD cases and 85% of DLB patients. CONCLUSION: RBD and hyposmia are both prevalent among Moroccan patients with synucleinopathy and they occur frequently during the prodromal phase. Identifying these premotor signs will improve early and differential diagnosis and enhance our understanding of how a specific synucleinopathy progresses.

37243326|t|Brief Test of Olfactory Dysfunction Based on Diagnostic Features of Specific Odors in Early-Stage Alzheimer Disease.
37243326|a|BACKGROUND Olfactory impairment is an early symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, it is rarely assessed in clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the identification and discrimination of specific odors in patients with early-stage AD using the Sniffin' Sticks test and determine the items that would be most valuable in the diagnosis of early-stage AD in order to create a brief test of olfactory dysfunction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three groups of participants were enrolled, including 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD group), 30 with mild dementia due to AD (MD-AD group), and 30 older participants with normal cognition (NC group). All participants underwent cognitive (Clinical Dementia Rating, Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, and verbal fluency tests) and olfactory (Burghart Sniffin' Sticks odor identification and odor discrimination tests) assessments. RESULTS The MD-AD group scored significantly lower than the MCI-AD group and the MCI-AD group scored significantly lower than the NC group in both the odor identification (P<0.001) and discrimination (P<0.05) tasks. The shortened versions of the odor identification and discrimination tasks showed good diagnostic properties in differentiating patients with AD from the NC participants (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area under the curve [AUC]=0.912 and 0.954, respectively) and differentiating patients with MCI-AD from the NC participants (ROC AUC=0.871 and 0.959, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The brief versions of olfactory tests, containing selected items that were found to differ the most between cognitively normal participants and early-stage AD patients, have good diagnostic qualities and can aid clinicians in screening for early-stage AD.

37258792|t|Identifying the potential role of serum miR-20a as a biomarker for olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease.
37258792|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction (OD), one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), is a cardinal prodromal symptom that can appear years before the onset of motor symptoms. Ongoing studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are suitable biomarkers for PD, while there is a lack of robust miRNAs that can serve as markers for OD in PD. METHODS: The concordantly differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in the damaged olfactory system were first identified in 2 OD-related Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Then, they were verified in another PD-related GEO dataset and only one miRNA (miR-20a) was found to be significantly altered. Serum levels of miR-20a were further measured by qPCR in 79 PD patients with OD (PD-OD), 52 PD patients without OD (PD-NOD), and 52 healthy controls (HC). Objective measure of OD was defined by 16-item Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test. All the participants underwent a demographic and comprehensive PD-related clinical assessment. RESULTS: Our results proved that miR-20a was significantly downregulated in PD-OD compared with PD-NOD and the area under curve (AUC) for OD detection by miR-20a was 0.803 (95% confidence interval, 0.724-0.883). In addition, PD-OD had higher scores of Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, Hoehn and Yahr stage (H-Y), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3, NMSS 5, NMSS 9, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Activity of Daily Living (ADL), and lower scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 39-item PD Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) than PD-NOD. Binary regression model further presented that lower expressions of miR-20a and poorer cognitive function acted as promoting factors in the development of OD. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-20a could be a novel biomarker for OD in PD and PD-OD patients tend to have higher disease stage, poorer motor aspects of experiences of daily living, worse cognitive scores, and inferior quality of life, and were more likely to have mental disorders. Cognitive function, in particular, is strongly associated with OD in PD patients.

37759734|t|Olfactory Dysfunction Is Associated with Cerebral Amyloid Deposition and Cognitive Function in the Trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease.
37759734|a|Olfactory dysfunction is consistently observed in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its association with beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship among olfactory function, cerebral Abeta deposition, and neuropsychological profiles in individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. A total of 164 participants were included, and olfactory function was assessed using the brief smell identification test (B-SIT). Cerebral Abeta deposition was measured using [18F]-flutemetamol PET imaging (A-PET). The results show a significant group difference in olfactory function, with the highest impairment observed in the Abeta-positive MCI and AD dementia groups, and the impairment was the lowest in Abeta-negative NCI. Olfactory dysfunction was positively associated with cognitive impairments across multiple domains. Furthermore, individuals with Abeta deposition had lower olfactory function compared to those without Abeta, even within the same neuropsychological stage. The association between olfactory dysfunction and Abeta deposition was observed globally and in specific cortical regions. These findings suggest that olfactory dysfunction is associated with both cognitive function and cerebral Abeta pathology in the trajectory of AD. Olfactory deficits may serve as an additional marker for disease progression and contribute to understanding the underlying mechanisms of AD.

38007646|t|Changes in Taste Perception in Patients with Minor and Major Cognitive Impairment Linked to Alzheimer's Disease Recorded by Gustatory Evoked Potentials.
38007646|a|BACKGROUND: The need for early diagnosis biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is growing. Only few studies have reported gustatory dysfunctions in AD using subjective taste tests. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of the study was to explore gustatory functions using subjective taste tests and recordings of gustatory evoked potentials (GEPs) for sucrose solution in patients with minor or major cognitive impairment (CI) linked to AD, and to compare them with healthy controls. The secondary objective was to evaluate the relationships between GEPs and the results of cognitive assessments and fasting blood samples. METHODS: A total of 45 subjects (15 healthy subjects, 15 minor CI patients, 15 major CI patients) were included to compare their gustatory functions and brain activity by recording GEPs in response to a sucrose stimulation. CI groups were combined in second analyses in order to keep a high power in the study. Correlations were made with cognitive scores and hormone levels (ghrelin, leptin, insulin, serotonin). RESULTS: Increased P1 latencies and reduced N1 amplitudes were observed in minor or major patients compared to controls. GEPs were undetectable in 6 major and 4 minor CI patients. Thresholds for sucrose detection were significantly higher in the major CI group than in controls or the minor CI group. No correlation was found with hormone levels. CONCLUSIONS: The cortical processing of sensory taste information seems to be altered in patients with minor or major CI linked to AD. This disturbance was identifiable with subjective taste tests only later, at the major CI stage.

38615524|t|The role of olfactory dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis.
38615524|a|PURPOSE: This comprehensive meta-analysis investigates the association between olfactory deficits in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A thorough search across databases identified articles analyzing olfactory status in MCI or AD patients. Methodological quality assessment followed PRISMA guidelines. Hedges' g effect size statistic computed standard mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Moderator analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Among the included studies (65 for MCI and 61 for AD), odor identification exhibited larger effect sizes compared to odor threshold and discrimination, in both MCI and AD samples. Moderate effect size is found in OI scores in MCI (k = 65, SE = 0.078, CI 95% = [-1.151, -0.844]). Furthermore, compared to MCI, AD had moderate to large heterogeneous effects in olfactory identification (k = 61, g = -2.062, SE = 0.125, CI 95% = [-2.308, -1.816]). Global cognitive status is positively related to olfactory identification impairment in both MCI (k = 57, Z = 2.74, p = 0.006) and AD (k = 53, Z = 5.03, p < 0.0001) samples. CONCLUSION: Olfactory impairments exhibit a notable and substantial presence in MCI. Among these impairments, odor identification experiences the greatest decline in MCI, mirroring the primary sensory deficit observed in AD. Consequently, the incorporation of a straightforward odor identification test is advisable in the evaluation of individuals vulnerable to the onset of AD, offering a practical screening tool for early detection.

38811023|t|Performance of a cost-effective olfactory test to evaluate hyposmia in Parkinson's disease patients.
38811023|a|BACKGROUND:  Parkinson's disease (PD) causes motor and non-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, which is evaluated through olfactory tests in the clinical practice. OBJECTIVE:  To assess the feasibility of using the modified Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (mCCCRC) olfactory test and to compare its performance with the Sniffin' Sticks-12 (SS-12, Burghart Messtechnik GmbH, Wedel, Germany) test. METHODS:  A transversal case-control study in which the patients were divided into the PD group (PDG) and the control group (CG). The cost and difficulty in handling substances to produce the mCCCRC test kits were evaluated. Sociodemographic characteristics, smoking habits, past coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, self-perception of odor sense, and cognition through the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were also evaluated. The PDG was scored by part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (H&Y) scale. Correlations were assessed through the Spearman rank correlation coefficient test (rho, or rho). RESULTS:  The mCCCRC test was easily manufactured and handled at a cost ten times lower compared with the SS-12. The groups (PDG: n = 34; CG: n = 38) were similar in terms of age, sex, level of schooling, smoking habits, and history of COVID-19. The tests results showed moderate correlation (rho = 0.65; p < 0.0001). The CG presented better cognitive performance and scored better in both tests (p < 0.0001). There was a tendency for a negative correlation with age, but good correlation with the MoCA (p = 0.0029). The results of the PDG group showed no correlation with olfactory results and motor performance or disease duration. The self-perception of hyposmia was low in both groups. CONCLUSION:  The mCCCRC is an easy-to-apply and inexpensive method that demonstrated a similar performance to that of the SS-12 in evaluating olfaction in PD patients and healthy controls.

39043904|t|Unraveling olfactory subtypes in Parkinson's disease and their effect on the natural history of the disease.
39043904|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia in Parkinson's disease (PD) had been studied before but had not been detailed by its temporal progression. This study observed how each olfactory subtype evolved in terms of motor symptoms, cardiac sympathetic innervation, and cognition. METHODS: Two hundred and three early PD patients were classified as normosmia, hyposmia-converter (hypo-converter), and hyposmia. Their presynaptic monoamine availability at the time of diagnosis was assessed by positron emission tomography imaging using 18F-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane and compared across the subtypes. Motor symptoms were evaluated in all patients, cardiac denervation was examined in 183 patients, and cognition in 195 patients were assessed using a neuropsychological battery. The domains were re-assessed 2-4 times, and the longitudinal data were analyzed to discern the natural course of each subtype. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (14.3%) patients belonged to the normosmia group, 34 (16.7%) to the hypo-converter group, and the rest to the hyposmia (69.0%) group. 85.7% of the total population became hyposmic during an average 3 years of follow-up. The baseline motor symptoms, cardiac denervation, and cognition were comparable across the olfactory subtypes. Across the subtypes, a decline in the presynaptic monoamine densities of the caudate, especially the ventral-anterior subdivisions, correlated inversely with olfaction dysfunction. Over time, motor and cardiac denervation burdens worsened regardless of olfactory subtypes, but hypo-converters experienced faster cognitive deterioration than the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the olfactory subtypes have differential significance along the disease course, which might reflect the involvement of different neuro-biochemical circuitries.

39216171|t|Association of severe hyposmia and frontal lobe dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease.
39216171|a|BACKGROUNDS AND OBJECTIVES: Severe hyposmia (SH) is a prodromal symptom of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) caused by Lewy bodies deposited in the limbic regions that connect the frontal and temporal lobes. We aimed to clarify the association between hyposmia and frontal lobe dysfunction (FLD) among patients with PD. METHODS: Patients with PD and Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3 at on-periods without apparent dementia were screened. FLD was defined as a score of <=14 on the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). SH was defined as an average recognition threshold >4 in the T&T Olfactometer. For each subscore, a recognition score of >=4 was defined as SH. We examined whether SH and its subscores were associated with FLD and evaluated which FAB subscore might be lower in PD patients with SH using Poisson regression analysis with a robust variance estimator. RESULTS: We included 189 patients (median age, 68 years; 107 [57 %] male). FLD was observed in 53 (28 %) patients. Multivariable analysis showed that SH (PR 1.789, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1.115-2.872, p = 0.016) was associated with FLD. Regarding odor domains, only SH for fruity smells was associated with FLD (PR 1.970, 95 % CI 1.306-2.972, p = 0.001). Patients with SH had a higher subscore only for FAB-1 (similarity [conceptualization], p = 0.030), indicating linguistically mediated executive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: In patients with PD, SH is associated with FLD, especially with linguistically mediated executive dysfunction. Particularly, SH for fruity smells may be a sensitive indicator of FLD.

2381506|t|Olfactory thresholds are associated with degree of dementia in Alzheimer's disease.
2381506|a|Recent neuroanatomical studies have noted that regions of the olfactory pathways contain high levels of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease; and that the olfactory epithelium, the most peripheral level of the system, exhibits anatomical and biochemical changes in Alzheimer's disease. The present experiments investigated thresholds for olfactory and taste stimuli in patients with Probable Alzheimer's disease. Olfactory thresholds of Alzheimer's patients were significantly elevated relative to controls and were significantly correlated with scores on dementia scales. Taste thresholds of Alzheimer's patients were within normal limits and unrelated to scores on dementia scales. These results suggest that increased olfactory thresholds in patients with Alzheimer's disease reflect the effects of the disease process and, thus, may aid in the diagnosis and in the understanding of Alzheimer's disease.

2525363|t|Influence of age and age-related diseases on olfactory function.
2525363|a|It is clear from this review that olfactory function is markedly altered in old age and in a number of age-related diseases. The deficits appear to be rather general and detectable by several types of olfactory tests. Considerable interindividual variability exists, however, and the physiologic bases of these changes are not clear. In many healthy elderly persons, smell loss appears to occur as a result of one or more causes, including viral insult, cumulated exposure to toxic fumes, head trauma, and calcification of the cribriform plate. Several reviews have appeared suggesting that the olfactory system may be a center of primary involvement in AD. Of particular interest is the hypothesis that environmental agents (related etiologically to the disease process) pass into the central nervous system via the highly active transport mechanisms of the olfactory receptors. This latter notion, although attractive, must be viewed conservatively, as it is possible that the olfactory pathways are simply selectively vulnerable to destruction by various disease processes. This may explain why Huntington's chorea and multiinfarct dementia, in addition to AD and PD, are associated with alterations in smell function. Although it is tempting to assume, as have authors such as Koss et al., that alterations in threshold function reflect peripheral olfactory dysfunction and that alterations in odor identification and other more demanding tasks reflect central olfactory dysfunction, there is little empirical support for such a simple dichotomy. Despite the fact that a peripheral/central distinction is useful in clinical audiology (where threshold loss is commonly associated with CN VIII pathology), an evaluation of the utility of this distinction in olfaction requires further research. The limited data suggest that both identification and detection deficits commonly arise from damage to the olfactory epithelium, even though identification deficits unassociated with detection deficits may occur in some central brain disorders. It is apparent from the studies reviewed in this chapter that considerable progress has been made during the last decade in elucidating the nature and prevalence of olfactory disturbances in elderly patients, as well as in patients with dementia-related diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

3399073|t|Olfactory detection and identification performance are dissociated in early Alzheimer's disease.
3399073|a|Ten carefully screened men with very mild symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and ten healthy controls of similar age were compared on multiple chemosensory tasks: odor detection and identification, and taste detection. The patients scored significantly worse than controls on identification of odors and of a subset of airborne stimuli providing trigeminal stimulation. In contrast, the patients' olfactory detection thresholds as well as taste detection thresholds were not impaired relative to those of controls. The patients' scores on neuropsychological tests and the results 18F-2 deoxy-D-glucose PET studies did not correlate with any of the chemosensory measures. The isolated odor identification deficit suggests that the initial chemosensory impairment in AD is central rather than peripheral.

3632374|t|Olfactory deficits as a neurologic sign in dementia of the Alzheimer type.
3632374|a|Many patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) have an abnormal sense of smell. I studied 18 mildly demented subjects with DAT between the ages of 60 and 80 years and found them less able to identify five fragrances compared with 26 healthy elderly controls. The mean (+/- SEM) olfactory identification score for demented subjects was 0.3 +/- 0.2 compared with 2.8 +/- 0.2 for controls. When the subjects were given a multiple-choice list of ten items including the test fragrances and five other odors, performance of both demented and normal subjects improved, with a score of 1.8 +/- 0.4 for subjects with DAT and 4.2 +/- 0.2 for controls. The findings suggest that olfactory deficits are a sensitive, although non-specific, indicator of mild DAT.

6508242|t|Quality-specific taste changes in multiple sclerosis.
6508242|a|Taste sensitivity in 79 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 65 age- and sex-matched control subjects was measured with a sip-and-spit, suprathreshold scaling, magnitude estimation procedure using six concentrations each of sodium chloride, sucrose, citric acid, and quinine hydrochloride. Results were analyzed with a taste scoring system and by plotting psychophysical functions (log concentration versus log magnitude estimate) normalized to 1.0 M sucrose. Gender did not affect taste scores, but age was inversely related, so the results were analyzed by an analysis of covariance with age as the covariant. There was a significant alteration in taste sensitivity in the subjects with MS for sodium chloride and quinine hydrochloride stimuli but not for sucrose and citric acid; these results were confirmed by a separate analysis of the psychophysical functions. Some of the MS taste scores correlated with MS functional and physical disability scores. Taste sensitivity was not correlated with clinical history or presence of facial symptoms.

9056090|a|The aim of this investigation was to compare olfactory functions of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory threshold, odor identification ability and odor memory performance were assessed in 21 non-demented PD patients and in 22 AD patients. Both patient groups were impaired in relation to an age-matched control group for the measure of odor identification. AD patients showed a higher olfactory threshold and poorer odor memory performance.

9233364|t|Taste and smell in familial dysautonomia.
9233364|a|Familial dysautonomia (FD) is one of the classic diseases characterised by taste and smell abnormalities. However, these typical features are based on data obtained from two separate crude studies published in 1964. In the present study psychophysical-cognitive and reflex-like facial-behavioral responses to taste and smell, in nine patients with FD and 15 healthy controls, were recorded. Five taste stimulants were presented to both study groups, while a selection of common household odors was used for FD patients only. The patients with FD showed a markedly higher incidence of recognition failures for salty, bitter, sweet, and water stimuli than the controls, but rate of recognition of sour stimuli was almost identical in the two groups. Estimates by the subjects on a hedonic scale of 0 to 10 and facial display in FD indicated a relatively normal sensitivity to sour stimuli and to a lesser extent to bitter stimuli. Water, sweet, and salty stimuli evoked non-discriminatory responses. These findings indicate specific dyageusia rather than general ageusia. Smell was found to be normal. In children with taste and smell impairment, a systematic evaluative approach may help in planning palatable diets for adequate and comfortable nutrition.

9443714|t|Olfaction in neurodegenerative disease: a meta-analysis of olfactory functioning in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
9443714|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) have been well established. OBJECTIVE: To clarify and review the literature by evaluating the evidence for olfactory deficits in 3 olfactory domains, including odor identification, recognition, and detection threshold. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of English-language studies of olfaction in AD, PD, and healthy controls was conducted via online databases (PsycInfo and MEDLINE) and reference lists from review articles. STUDY SELECTION: To meet selection criteria for meta-analysis, each study required a control group and complete and usable data. This review yielded 26 publications of olfactory identification, recognition, and/or detection threshold. Because of the inclusion of more than 1 relevant study of olfaction in several of these publications (eg, both identification and threshold assessed), 43 studies were ultimately appropriate for meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Effect sizes were calculated for each study by expressing differences between patient and control group means in SD units (Cohen's d). DATA SYNTHESIS: Extremely large effect sizes were shown across all tasks in both AD and PD groups. Both between-group analyses using the Mann-Whitney U test and within-group analyses using Friedman 2-way analysis of variance did not reveal any significant differences (all P > .30). CONCLUSIONS: As expected, severe deficits were found for both patients with AD and PD in each of the 3 olfactory domains relative to controls. However, no discriminating olfactory deficits were seen between patient groups or among the 3 measured olfactory domains, suggesting a similar disturbance in olfactory function between patients with AD and PD.

10678509|t|Olfactory dysfunction discriminates probable Alzheimer's dementia from major depression: a cross-validation and extension.
10678509|a|The present study was conducted to cross-validate and extend the hypothesis that olfactory dysfunction could discriminate between groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease and major depression. Forty patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for either Alzheimer's disease or major depression (20 per group) underwent assessment with the Pocket Smell Test (PST), a three-item screening measure of odor identification, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A PST score of < or = 1 (1 or 0 correct) discriminated between the groups with a hit rate of 97.5% (sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 100%). The optimal hit rate for the MMSE (< or =24) was less effective (hit rate = 90%, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 100%). Age, gender, and education had minimal impact on the PST for both groups. Olfactory assessment continues to add to the diagnostic utility in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease versus major depression in elderly patients.

10855362|t|[Olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease and in Parkinson's disease. Review of the literature].
10855362|a|Olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease have been the topic of a large body of work over the last decades. Work devoted to olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease includes over 300 papers providing clinical and fundamental data. Anatomy studies in Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated a specific concentration of lesions in peripheral and central olfactory structures (senile plaques, neurofibrillary degeneration) as well as lesions in layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex. These neuropathological findings led to the development of the hypothesis that olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease would result from a toxic process. Observed olfactory deficits involve both identification and recognition of odors and detection thresholds. Nevertheless, patients with Alzheimer's disease rarely consult for sensorial deficits as the other signs of the disease predominate. Neuropathology data on the olfactory system are much more sparse in Parkinson's disease. Lewy bodies suggestive of Parkinson's disease have been observed in the olfactory bulb and pathways, but, unlike Alzheimer's disease, the olfactory disorders appear to be stable, changing little over time, as opposed to the evolution of neurological symptoms and cognition impairment. Clinicians should be aware that olfactory disorders are an integral part of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Screening for sensorial impairment however is a secondary objective in the context of these neurodegenerative diseases.

10964854|t|Olfactory deficits in patients with mild cognitive impairment predict Alzheimer's disease at follow-up.
10964854|a|OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the predictive utility of olfactory identification deficits in patients with mild cognitive impairment for follow-up diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: Ninety outpatients with mild cognitive impairment were examined at 6-month intervals. Matched healthy comparison subjects (N=45) were examined annually. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test was given at baseline. RESULTS: Olfaction scores were lower in patients with mild cognitive impairment than in healthy comparison subjects. Seventy-seven patients were followed up; 19 were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by 2 years. Patients with low olfaction scores (< or =34 of 40), and patients with low olfaction scores who reported no subjective problems smelling, were more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than other patients. In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, modified Mini-Mental State score, and education, low olfaction scores did not predict time until development of Alzheimer's disease, but low olfaction scores accompanied by lack of awareness of olfactory deficits predicted time to development of Alzheimer's disease. This effect remained when attention or memory measures replaced modified Mini-Mental State score in the model. In patients with high Mini-Mental State scores (> or =27 of 30), low olfaction with lack of awareness remained a significant predictor of Alzheimer's disease. Olfaction scores of 30-35 showed moderate to strong sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild cognitive impairment, olfactory identification deficits, particularly with lack of awareness of olfactory deficits, may have clinical utility as an early diagnostic marker for Alzheimer's disease.

11302075|t|Inherited Alzheimer's disease PS-1 olfactory function: a 10-year follow-up study.
11302075|a|This study was undertaken to evaluate smell tests as a clinical marker for identifying mutation carrier status and determining the clinical diagnosis of presenilin-1 Alzheimer's disease (AD) in family members of those afflicted with the disease. Ten years ago, we gave the self-administered, 40-question scratch and sniff University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test to 18 at-risk family members, individuals with dominantly-inherited Alzheimer's disease. Testing results were normal 10 years ago except in the case of one individual who had smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for more than 23 years. Four subjects tested in 1990 are now afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, including the smoker. The smell test in 1990 did not demonstrate predictive capabilities before clinical conversion to dementia. At follow-up, two subjects were too impaired to take the test. Two "converted" from normal smell function to abnormal function with a wide range in score. Study findings indicate that the smell test is too variable a measure to be used as a reliable test for predicting or verifying a diagnosis of presenilin-1 Alzheimer's disease.

12707068|t|Identifying the pattern of olfactory deficits in Parkinson disease using the brief smell identification test.
12707068|a|BACKGROUND: Selective olfactory deficits occur in 70% to 90% of patients with Parkinson disease, independent of disease severity and duration. Olfactory testing may be a useful diagnostic aid for Parkinson disease, but the types of odors most commonly affected need to be identified. OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern and types of odors affected in Parkinson disease by means of the University of Pennsylvania 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT; Sensonics, Inc, Haddon Heights, NJ). DESIGN: Testing patients with Parkinson disease and control subjects in 5 movement disorder clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine nondemented patients with Parkinson disease and 52 age- and sex-matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Normal or abnormal olfactory function was determined in each subject according to predetermined age and sex norms. Predictive statistics and discriminant function analyses were performed to determine the pattern and types of odors best discriminating patients from controls. RESULTS: Abnormal olfactory function was present in 40 (82%) of patients compared with 12 (23%) of controls. The B-SIT score was unaffected by smoking behavior, disease duration, or severity. The sensitivity of the B-SIT for Parkinson disease was 0.82, with a specificity and predictive value of 0.82 and 0.77, respectively. Only 5 of the 12 B-SIT odors (gasoline, banana, pineapple, smoke, and cinnamon) were required to adequately discriminate patients with Parkinson disease from controls. CONCLUSIONS: With the use of the B-SIT, 5 specific odors appear primarily affected in patients with Parkinson disease. Significantly, the ability of patients to detect some odors was unimpaired compared with that of controls. Better diagnostic aids could be developed on the basis of the selective pattern of hyposmia observed in Parkinson disease.

14594747|t|Olfactory function in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: an investigation using psychophysical and electrophysiological techniques.
14594747|a|OBJECTIVE: To clarify the olfactory deficit hypothesis regarding Alzheimer's disease, the authors compared olfactory function in patients with Alzheimer's disease, subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy comparison subjects. METHOD: Olfactory function of 14 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, eight subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and eight healthy age-matched comparison subjects was assessed with both psychophysical tests and olfactory event-related potentials. RESULTS: Group comparison of the psychophysical test results showed a significant main effect of diagnosis for odor detection threshold, odor discrimination, and odor identification. These results correlated only partially with those obtained from olfactory event-related potentials. Seven Alzheimer's disease patients and four with mild cognitive impairment showed no olfactory event-related potentials, suggesting hyposmia, while all comparison subjects had clearly discernible responses. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were significantly more likely to be nonresponders. In the four Alzheimer's disease patients and four subjects with mild cognitive impairment who had clear electrophysiological responses, amplitudes and latencies of the various event-related potential components were normal, i.e., similar to those of the comparison subjects, although 12 of the 14 Alzheimer's disease patients and seven of the eight mildly impaired subjects were classified as functionally anosmic with psychophysical methods. CONCLUSIONS: The electrophysiological results confirm prior findings of olfactory dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Investigations of larger study groups with detailed cognitive examination and postmortem diagnosis may resolve the intriguing possibility of early diagnosis and discrimination of Alzheimer's disease subtypes through chemosensory event-related potentials in addition to existing biomarkers.

17012338|t|The relationship between cerebral Alzheimer's disease pathology and odour identification in old age.
17012338|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is common in old age, but its basis is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that difficulty in identifying odours in old age is related to the accumulation of Alzheimer's disease pathology. METHODS: As part of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, participants completed the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test, a standard measure of odour identification. During a mean (standard deviation (SD)) of 2.2 (1.2) years of follow-up (range 0.2-4.9), 166 people died, with brain autopsies performed on 129 (77.7%) people and neuropathological examinations completed on 77 (mean (SD) age at death 87.5 (5.9) years; median postmortem interval 6.1 h). From a uniform postmortem examination of multiple brain regions, summary measures of plaque and tangle pathology were derived on the basis of silver staining, and those of amyloid beta burden, tangle density and Lewy bodies on the basis of immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Odour identification performance ranged from 0 to 12 correct (mean (SD) 8.0 (2.6)). In analyses adjusted for age, sex and education, a composite measure of plaques and tangles accounted for >12% of the variation in odour identification. The association remained after controlling for dementia or semantic memory. Density of tau tangles was inversely related to odour identification. A similar effect for amyloid burden was attenuated after controlling for tangles. The association with odour identification was robust for tangles in the entorhinal cortex and CA1/subiculum area of the hippocampus, but not for tangles in other cortical sites. Lewy bodies, identified in 12.5%, were not related to odour identification, probably partly due to to their relative infrequency. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that difficulty in identifying familiar odours in old age is partly due to the accumulation of neurofibrillar pathology in central olfactory regions.

17156971|t|Presentation of Alzheimer's disease in patients with and without olfactory deficits.
17156971|a|Odor identification deficits are frequently reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but are not universal. This study examines differences in clinical presentation in AD patients with and without odor identification impairments. Ninety patients with probable AD were administered an odor identification test as part of a neuropsychological evaluation. Variables examined included demographic information, cognitive and behavioral measures, dementia severity, neuroimaging findings, and aspects of clinical history. Defining the groups with a median split, olfactory impaired and olfactory intact patients were mostly similar, though patients with impaired odor identification performance were more likely to be male, less likely to have a family history of dementia, and had worse visuospatial functioning. The differences noted raise the possibility of a clinical subtype of the disease.

The SD patients were found to have a severe impairment of identification from olfaction despite having normal discrimination, consistent with the multimodal semantic impairment characteristic of this patient group. The AD patients' poor odour discrimination suggests that a perceptual impairment is the root of their poor odour identification. Mild impairments in odour identification observed in FTD and CBD are consistent with their generalised executive dysfunction. The findings illustrate that breakdown in olfaction can occur at a perceptual or semantic level, analogous to the distinction between apperceptive and associative forms of deficit in the visual and auditory modalities. The findings add further insights into the nature of the semantic deficit in SD by exploring a hitherto neglected modality and may have relevance in explaining the altered eating habits commonly associated with SD.

17534948|t|Analysis of olfactory function and the depth of olfactory sulcus in patients with Parkinson's disease.
17534948|a|Olfactory deficit is known to occur frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore olfactory deficit in PD and to investigate its possible correlation with the disease severity or the depth of the olfactory sulcus. Fifty-nine PD patients and 25 normal controls were examined by the odor identification test with the crosscultural smell identification test (CC-SIT). Among these subjects, the depth of the olfactory sulcus of 42 PD patients and 8 controls was measured in the plane of the posterior tangent through the eyeballs using the coronal view brain MRI. The CC-SIT scores of the PD patients were significantly lower than those of the normal control (P<0.001). However, CC-SIT did not correlate with the disease duration, H-Y stage, score of UPDRS Part III, or the depth of either side of the olfactory sulcus (P>0.05). Our study confirms that CC-SIT is a helpful test in detecting the olfactory deficit in Korean PD patients. The absence of correlation of olfactory deficit with the disease severity or the depth of olfactory sulcus may suggest that olfactory loss precede the development of motor signs and not be a primary consequence of damage to the olfactory sulcus.

17875380|t|Odor identification deficits in frontotemporal dementia: a preliminary study.
17875380|a|Multiple neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease) show olfactory deficits. Olfactory functioning has not been well studied in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In the current study, individuals with FTD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy elderly controls were compared using an odor identification task. Results showed significant differences in odor identification between individuals with FTD and the healthy elderly control group. There were no differences between the FTD and AD groups. Using a cut score of 8/12, discriminant function analysis showed that the overall classification rate for the FTD and control groups was 71.4%, with a sensitivity rate of 87.5% and a specificity rate of 65%. This preliminary research demonstrates olfactory deficits in FTD, which appear to be similar in magnitude to the olfactory deficits seen in AD.

17876408|t|[Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease].
17876408|a|OBJECTIVE: To characterize the olfactory dysfunction in 50 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with the University of Pennsylvania 12 smell identification test (UPSIT), establishing a comparison with 76 age-matched healthy controls, and associate with clinical and epidemiologic picture. METHOD: The PD group was evaluated in phase "on" through United Parkinson's disease rating scale, UPSIT, and Hoehn and Yahr stage and the control group with the UPSIT. RESULTS: The mean UPSIT score was 5.7 in PD patients and 9 in the control group. Patients that presented initially resting tremor and those that currently have tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia had a significant lower scores. There were negative correlation between patients' age and PD stage with the UPSIT scores. There were no correlation between olfactory scores, age at the initial PD symptoms and disease duration. CONCLUSION: Among PD patients 80% had olfactory deficit and, therefore, smell evaluation may be a tool to make PD differential diagnosis.

17876851|t|Risk factors for Parkinson's disease and impaired olfaction in relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease.
17876851|a|Our objective was to assess the association between risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) and abnormal olfaction in first-degree relatives of patients with PD. Factors including lower cigarette smoking and lower caffeine consumption have been associated with increased risk of PD. Idiopathic hyposmia has also been associated with an increased risk of PD. The relationship between risk factors for PD and impaired olfactory function has not been evaluated in relatives of PD patients. We conducted a mail survey of odor identification ability in 173 first-degree relatives of PD patients using the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Respondents also completed a questionnaire inquiring about risk factors for PD including caffeine consumption, tobacco use, exercise, and exposures to heavy metals, well-water, and pesticides. There was a direct relationship between olfactory performance and lifetime caffeine intake. After adjustment for age, gender, and smoking status, subjects who reported drinking 2 to 3 cups of caffeinated beverages per day (2.6 points higher 95% CI: 0.5, 4.5) and 4 or more cups per day (3.7 points higher, 95% CI: 0.6, 6.7) had significantly better UPSIT scores than those who consumed less than 1 cup per day. There was no significant relationship between olfactory performance and other risk factors. In conclusion, abnormal olfaction is associated with significantly lower lifetime caffeine consumption in first-degree relatives of PD patients. Further research is warranted to determine whether a history of lower caffeine consumption confers additional risk for the development of PD in hyposmic relatives of PD patients.

18343969|t|A longitudinal study of olfactory function in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
18343969|a|Olfactory function is diminished in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD). Because previous work almost exclusively relied upon cross-sectional studies, the present investigation aimed to address the correlation between olfactory loss and duration of disease within the context of a longitudinal study, accompanying well-diagnosed patients over an average period of 4.4 years. A group of 27 IPD patients was examined (5 women, 22 men; age range 27-64 years; duration of disease: 0 to 19 years). Psychophysical olfactory testing was performed after 3-6 years (mean 4.4 years) using the "Sniffin' Sticks" test battery which consists of subtests for odor thresholds, odor discrimination, and odor identification. The study yielded the following major results: (1) olfactory function in IPD patients changes in an unpredictable manner, (2) especially when considering results from the second session relatively few IPD patients were completely anosmic; none of the patients, however, were normosmic. One possible explanation for these findings may lie in the hypothesis based on results by Huisman et al. (2004) who reported an increase of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb in IPD patients. In this scenario, olfactory loss seen early in the disease may be based on an incomplete inhibition of olfactory input at the level of the olfactory bulb.

19401224|t|Olfactory-induced brain activity in Parkinson's disease relates to the expression of event-related potentials: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
19401224|a|Olfactory disorders are common in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). In IPD patients with hyposmia olfactory event-related potentials (ERPs) are typically found to be delayed or absent. Altered ERPs in IPD patients may also be consistent with reduced neuronal activity in the medial temporal lobe following olfactory stimulation, as demonstrated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed ERPs and fMRI scans of hyposmic IPD patients (n=18) to gain further insight about the brain regions involved in generation of olfactory ERPs. Patients were separated into two groups (n=9 per group), based on the detectability (+) or non-detectability (-) of ERPs. Central activation during olfactory stimulation was examined using fMRI. Both ERP+ and ERP- patients showed activity in brain areas relevant to olfactory processing, such as the amygdala, parahippocampal regions, and temporal regions (BA 37, 21/22). Comparison of both groups revealed higher activation in ERP+ patients, especially in the amygdala, parahippocampal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47), insula, cingulate gyrus, striatum, and inferior temporal gyrus. The relationship between the expression of olfactory ERPs and cortical activation patterns seen during olfactory stimulation in fMRI in IPD patients supports the idea that ERPs are a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration in olfactory regions. In accordance with current neuropathological staging concepts, olfactory ERPs may be reflecting pathological changes in olfactory regions, independent of the typically observed nigro-striatal degeneration in IPD. Reduced activation of primary olfactory areas in the ERP-group may reflect a severe disruption of olfactory processing in these patients.

19593181|t|Smell identification test as a treatment response marker in patients with Alzheimer disease receiving donepezil.
19593181|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction, impaired odor identification in particular, is known to occur in Alzheimer disease (AD). The entorhinal cortex and the olfactory bulb, critical areas for olfactory function, are rich in acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter implicated in AD pathology and treatment. In view of the common anatomical substrate, we aimed to determine whether performance on an olfaction test can be used as a clinical marker for monitoring the efficacy of donepezil in elderly people with AD. METHODS: Twenty-five participants with mild to moderate AD, planned for donepezil treatment, were recruited from mental health services for older adults in this open-labeled study. Assessments before commencing donepezil included Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Bristol Activities of Daily Living, and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. After 3 months of treatment, the primary outcome measure, the Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus caregiver input (CIBIC-plus), was completed, and the baseline assessments were repeated. RESULTS: Eighteen patients continued to receive donepezil at follow-up. The CIBIC-plus outcome correlated with changes in University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and Bristol Activities of Daily Living scores from the baseline (r = 0.7, P < 0.01). In addition, it was the change in smell identification function after treatment that best predicted CIBIC-plus outcome (P < 0.05) on ordinal regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Smell identification function could be useful as a clinical measure to assess treatment response with donepezil in AD.

20083017|t|Non-motor features of Parkinson's disease: depression and dementia.
20083017|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and primarily considered as a movement disorder defined by the presence of motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. However, it is nowadays widely recognized that in addition there is impairment of cognitive function, mood and the autonomic nervous system in a high percentage of PD patients, which is sometimes even more harming quality of life. These symptoms not only occur during the course of the disease but may even precede the onset of motor symptoms. Typical examples of non-motor features of PD are depression, constipation, REM sleep behaviour disorder, and hyposmia.

20666834|t|Differences in odor identification among clinical subtypes of Parkinson's disease.
20666834|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory dysfunction is a non-motor symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated whether this dysfunction differs among clinical subtypes of PD. METHODS: Participants comprised of 90 patients with idiopathic PD and without dementia. Olfactory function was evaluated using the odor stick identification test for Japanese, which evaluated the detection of 12 odorants familiar to Japanese participants. Patients were divided into tremor-dominant type (TDT), akinetic-rigid type (ART), and mixed type (MXT) PD subgroups using part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were classified as ART, 21 as MXT, and 14 as TDT. There were no differences in age, sex, or duration of illness among the subtypes. Subjective symptoms of impaired sense of smell were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the ART than in the TDT. Mean odor identification score was 4.3 in the ART, 5.2 in MXT, and 6.6 in TDT. It was significantly lower in the ART than in the TDT (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction differed among the clinical subtypes of PD. This suggests that olfactory function might relate to prognosis of patients with PD.

20669268|t|Olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease and white matter abnormalities in central olfactory areas: A voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging study.
20669268|a|Olfactory dysfunction is known to occur before the appearance of the classical motor signs in Parkinson's disease (PD) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in PD have reported fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions in the early disease stages. We aimed to investigate the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and white matter (WM) FA of central olfactory areas in early PD. Twenty-four patients at Hoehn and Yahr stages I and II and 24 healthy controls matched by age, gender and years of education participated in this study. DTI was acquired at a 3 Tesla scanner and odor identification was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We performed FA voxelwise group comparisons in the central olfactory structures using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and correlation analyses between FA values in these central olfactory areas and UPSIT scores. Patients with severe microsmia (UPSIT between 19 and 25) and anosmia (UPSIT lower or equal to 18) had lower FA values than PD patients with mild/moderate or no olfactory dysfunction (UPSIT between 26 and 40) and healthy controls in the WM adjacent to gyrus rectus. In addition, patients with anosmia had reduced FA in the WM surrounding primary olfactory areas in comparison with healthy controls. FA values in the WM adjacent to primary olfactory cortex and right gyrus rectus correlated with UPSIT scores in the PD group. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that microstructural WM reductions are present in the central olfactory system of early stage PD patients and that these reductions are associated with reduced ability to smell.

20930316|t|Olfactory deficits and amyloid-beta burden in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy aging: a PiB PET study.
20930316|a|Olfactory deficits and increased amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden are observed in people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI); both factors may be predictive of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We explored whether olfactory identification is related to in vivo measures of Abeta burden using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET. Nineteen control, 24 aMCI, and 20 AD participants completed an olfactory identification task and underwent PiB PET scanning. Control participants performed better on olfactory identification and showed lower PiB binding than aMCI patients. There was a significant correlation between both factors when pooling all groups together but not when considering each group separately. In addition, the olfactory identification score did not differ between aMCI participants who were PiB-positive and those who were PiB-negative. We conclude that AD-related olfactory identification deficits are not directly related to Abeta burden.

21109328|t|Locus coeruleus degeneration exacerbates olfactory deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
21109328|a|Neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus (LC) is 1 of the early pathological events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Projections of noradrenergic neurons of the LC innervate the olfactory bulb (OB). Because olfactory deficits have been reported in early AD, we investigated the effect of induced LC degeneration on olfactory memory and discrimination in an AD mouse model. LC degeneration was induced by treating APP/PS1 mice with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-bromo-benzylamine (DSP4) repeatedly between 3 and 12 months of age. Short term odor retention, ability for spontaneous habituation to an odor, and spontaneous odor discrimination were assessed by behavioral tests. DSP4 treatment in APP/PS1 mice resulted in an exacerbation of short term olfactory memory deficits and more discrete weakening of olfactory discrimination abilities, suggesting that LC degeneration contributes to olfactory deficits observed in AD. Importantly, DSP4 treatment also increased amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition in the olfactory bulb of APP/PS1 mice, which correlated with olfactory memory, not with discrimination deficits.

21193922|t|Taste function in patients with Parkinson disease.
21193922|a|Despite the important role of taste function in nutrition and health, little is known about changes in taste function caused by Parkinson disease (PD). The taste function of 31 PD patients and 29 healthy controls was assessed quantitatively using filter paper taste strip tests (TSTs) impregnated with four basic taste qualities at four different concentrations. The mean TST score was significantly lower in PD patients, as a consequence of taste impairment in the female PD patients (it did not differ significantly in males), which was likely to be attributable to the lower Mini-Mental State Examination score in patients with PD than in controls in women. TST scores in PD patients were not correlated with patient age, duration, or severity of their PD, or olfactory function. The findings of our study suggest that taste dysfunction should be included in the list of nonmotor symptoms of PD.

21251352|t|Awareness of olfactory deficits in healthy aging, amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
21251352|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is present in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has now been reported in people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Recent evidence suggests that unawareness of an olfactory deficit may predict which MCI patients will subsequently meet AD criteria. However, important methodological limitations challenge this suggestion. While addressing some of the limitations of previous research, this preliminary study explores unawareness of olfactory deficits as a predictive factor of future AD among people with aMCI. METHODS: Twenty-five participants with aMCI, 25 AD patients, and 22 healthy elderly participants underwent testing of olfactory identification. Subjective reports regarding perceived decline in olfactory detection and olfactory identification were also obtained. A subset of participants was reassessed 12 months later. RESULTS: Control participants performed better than both aMCI and AD patients on olfactory identification. Almost uniformly, participants did not report decline in either olfactory detection or identification. Prediction of olfactory identification scores from subjective reports of olfactory function was poor, and awareness of olfactory decline bore no relationship to the likelihood of aMCI patients progressing to AD by the 12-month review. CONCLUSIONS: Treating awareness of olfactory function as a unitary construct can be misleading, and there is a poor relationship between subjective and objective measures of olfactory ability. Our preliminary data suggest that unawareness of olfactory decline does not improve the identification of patients with MCI who are more likely to be in the prodromal phase of AD. Replication in a larger cohort is needed to support these findings.

21257733|t|Lewy bodies and olfactory dysfunction in old age.
21257733|a|As part of a clinical-pathologic project, older people completed a standard odor identification test at study entry. During a mean of 3.5 years of observation, 201 people died and underwent brain autopsy and neuropathologic examination (6 with a history of Parkinson's disease were excluded). Lewy bodies were identified with antibodies to alpha-synuclein and classified as nigral, limbic, or neocortical based on their distribution in 6 brain regions. Plaques and tangles in 5 regions were summarized with a previously established composite measure, and neuron loss in the substantia nigra was rated on 6-point scale. Odor identification scores ranged from 0 to 12 correct (mean = 8.0, standard deviation = 2.6). On neuropathologic examination, 26 persons had Lewy bodies (13 neocortical, 9 limbic, and 4 nigral). In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, education, and time from olfactory testing to death, limbic (estimate = -2.47, standard error [SE] = 0.73, P < 0.001) and neocortical (estimate = -4.36, SE = 0.63, P < 0.001) Lewy body subgroups were associated with impaired olfaction. Results were comparable in analyses that controlled for dementia or parkinsonism during the study or postmortem measures of plaques and tangles or nigral cell loss. A final set of analyses suggested that impaired olfactory performance may aid detection of underlying Lewy body disease. The findings indicate that Lewy body disease impairs late life olfactory function even in otherwise asymptomatic individuals.

21330398|t|Association of olfactory bulb volume and olfactory sulcus depth with olfactory function in patients with Parkinson disease.
21330398|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Olfactory dysfunction is commonly associated with IPD. We here report the association of OB volume and OS depth with olfactory function in patients with PD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphometric analyses by using MR imaging and the Japanese T&T olfactometer threshold test were used to evaluate olfactory structure and function in 29 patients with PD and 29 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The olfactory recognition thresholds were significantly higher in patients with PD than in healthy controls (3.82 +- 1.25 versus 0.45 +- 0.65, P<.001). Olfactory atrophy with reductions in the volume of the OB (37.30 +- 10.23 mm(3) versus 44.87 +- 11.84 mm(3), P<.05) and in the depth of OS (8.90 +- 1.42 mm versus 9.67 +- 1.24 mm, P<.05) was observed in patients with PD but not in controls. Positive correlations between olfactory performance and OB volumes were observed in both patients with PD (r=-0.45, P<.0001) and in controls (r=-0.42, P<.0001). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the depth of OS and olfactory function in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that early olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD may be a primary consequence of damage to the OB. Neuroimaging of olfactory structures together with the assessment of olfactory function may be used to identify patients with PD.

21554187|t|Do patients with motor neuron disease suffer from disorders of taste or smell?
21554187|a|Olfactory or gustatory dysfunction has been described in patients with motor neuron disease. This disorder along with other degenerative diseases has been tentatively linked with the olfactory vector hypothesis according to which a toxic agent may enter the organism via the nasal mucosa. In our study we assessed 26 patients diagnosed as suffering from motor neuron disease at various stages and compared them with 26 matched controls using 'Sniffin' Sticks' for smell and taste strips for taste testing. The two groups did not differ with respect to either ability. The smell test correlated with age, but not with the duration of the disease. We concluded that neither olfaction nor gustation seem to be linked to or influenced by the disease, making the causation by a toxin entering the body via the nasal or oral route rather unlikely as well as a degenerative process encompassing sensory pathways.

21638326|t|Odor identification deficits identify Parkinson's disease patients with poor cognitive performance.
21638326|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a prodromal and prevalent nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease. Unlike olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, it is believed to be unrelated to cognitive impairment. However, recent research has implicated cholinergic denervation in Parkinson's disease hyposmia and linked it to verbal memory. This research hypothesized that severe odor identification deficits may identify patients with Parkinson's disease at risk for cognitive impairment. The current study tested this hypothesis by comparing 24 functionally anosmic, nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease and 39 nonanosmic, nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease with 29 healthy control participants on composite scores of memory, processing speed, executive function, and language. The functionally anosmic group had significantly poorer visual and verbal memory than the nonanosmic group, which was indistinguishable from the control group. Furthermore, the functionally anosmic group had reduced processing speed compared with the nonanosmic patients with Parkinson's disease, who, in turn, were outperformed by the control group. On the composite language score, the score of the functionally anosmic group was significantly reduced compared with that of the control group, whereas the nonanosmic group scored in the medium range. The 2 patient groups did not differ on executive functioning. These findings demonstrate co-occurrence between reduced cognitive function and olfactory deficits in functionally anosmic patients with Parkinson's disease and support the notion of more severe cognitive deficits in this group.

22079585|t|Adh1 and Adh1/4 knockout mice as possible rodent models for presymptomatic Parkinson's disease.
22079585|a|Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) catalyze the reversible metabolism of many types of alcohols and aldehydes to prevent the possible toxic accumulation of these compounds. ADHs are of interest in Parkinson's disease (PD) since these compounds can be harmful to dopamine (DA) neurons. Genetic variants in ADH1C and ADH4 have been found to associate with PD and lack of Adh4 gene activity in a mouse model has recently been reported to induce changes in the DA system. Adh1 knockout (Adh1-/-) and Adh1/4 double knockout (Adh1/4-/-) mice were investigated for possible changes in DA system related activity, biochemical parameters and olfactory function compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Locomotor activity was tested at ~7 (adult) and >15 months of age to mimic the late onset of PD. Adh1-/- and Adh1/4-/- mice displayed a significantly higher spontaneous locomotor activity than WT littermates. Both apomorphine and d-amphetamine increased total distance activity in Adh1-/- mice at both age intervals and in Adh1/4-/- mice at 7 months of age compared to WT mice. No significant changes were found regarding olfactory function, however biochemical data showed decreased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/DA ratios in the olfactory bulb and decreased homovanillic acid (HVA)/DA ratios in the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex and striatum of Adh1/4-/- mice compared to WT mice. Our results suggest that lack of Adh1 alone or Adh1 and Adh4 together lead to changes in DA system related behavior, and that these knockout mice might be possible rodent models to study presymptomatic PD.

22287381|t|Severe olfactory dysfunction is a prodromal symptom of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease: a 3 year longitudinal study.
22287381|a|Dementia is one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A recent longitudinal study suggests that up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease will eventually develop dementia. Despite its clinical importance, the development of dementia is still difficult to predict at early stages. We previously identified olfactory dysfunction as one of the most important indicators of cortical hypometabolism in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we investigated the possible associations between olfactory dysfunction and the risk of developing dementia within a 3-year observation period. Forty-four patients with Parkinson's disease without dementia underwent the odour stick identification test for Japanese, memory and visuoperceptual assessments, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and 3 years later. A subgroup of patients with Parkinson's disease who exhibited severe hyposmia at baseline showed more pronounced cognitive decline at the follow-up survey. By the end of the study, 10 of 44 patients with Parkinson's disease had developed dementia, all of whom had severe hyposmia at baseline. The multivariate logistic analysis identified severe hyposmia and visuoperceptual impairment as independent risk factors for subsequent dementia within 3 years. The patients with severe hyposmia had an 18.7-fold increase in their risk of dementia for each 1 SD (2.8) decrease in the score of odour stick identification test for Japanese. We also found an association between severe hyposmia and a characteristic distribution of cerebral metabolic decline, which was identical to that of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analyses demonstrated close relationships between olfactory dysfunction and the atrophy of focal brain structures, including the amygdala and other limbic structures. Together, our findings suggest that brain regions related to olfactory function are closely associated with cognitive decline and that severe hyposmia is a prominent clinical feature that predicts the subsequent development of Parkinson's disease dementia.

22824520|t|Clinical application of a card-type odor identification test to olfactory assessment in Parkinson's disease.
22824520|a|OBJECTIVES: Current studies have provided valuable evidence that Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely associated with olfactory loss and that the use of olfactory testing is regarded as one of the potential screening tools for early diagnosis of PD. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with PD, age- and sex-matched 14 patients with other neurological diseases and 10 healthy controls were evaluated the sense of smell by the Open Essence (OE). RESULTS: The motor performance of the patients with PD was assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr scale. The OE scores for patients with PD were significantly lower than those with both the patients with other neurological diseases and controls. There was no significant difference of the OE scores between patients with other neurological diseases and controls. In the PD group, the OE score was not correlated with gender, smoking habit, disease duration, age at examination, or cognitive status. However, the OE scores were significantly correlated with Hoehn and Yahr stages. CONCLUSION: OE was found to be practically self-administered, time-saving, reliable, and inexpensive method for correct diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction associated with PD.

22832962|t|Olfactory discrimination predicts cognitive decline among community-dwelling older adults.
22832962|a|The presence of olfactory dysfunction in individuals at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease has significant diagnostic and screening implications for preventive and ameliorative drug trials. Olfactory threshold, discrimination and identification can be reliably recorded in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. The current study has examined the ability of various olfactory functions in predicting cognitive decline in a community-dwelling sample. A group of 308 participants, aged 46-86 years old, were recruited for this study. After 3 years of follow-up, participants were divided into cognitively declined and non-declined groups based on their performance on a neuropsychological battery. Assessment of olfactory functions using the Sniffin' Sticks battery indicated that, contrary to previous findings, olfactory discrimination, but not olfactory identification, significantly predicted subsequent cognitive decline (odds ratio = 0.869; P<0.05; 95% confidence interval = 0.764-0.988). The current study findings confirm previously reported associations between olfactory and cognitive functions, and indicate that impairment in olfactory discrimination can predict future cognitive decline. These findings further our current understanding of the association between cognition and olfaction, and support olfactory assessment in screening those at higher risk of dementia.

23470887|t|[Severe olfactory dysfunction is a predictor of dementia with Parkinson's disease].
23470887|a|Recently, we identified that hyposmia, one of the most typical non-motor features in Parkinson's disease (PD), was a predictive feature of PDD (Parkinson's disease dementia). The multivariate logistic analysis identified severe hyposmia and visuoperceptual impairment as independent risk factors for subsequent dementia within 3 years. The patients with severe hyposmia had an 18.7-fold increase in their risk of dementia for each 1 SD (2.8) decrease in the score of odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J). We also found an association between severe hyposmia and a characteristic distribution of cerebral metabolic decline, which was identical to the findings observed in PDD. Furthermore, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analyses demonstrated close relationships between olfactory dysfunction and the atrophy of focal brain structures, including the amygdala and other limbic structures. Dementia is one of the most debilitating symptoms of PD. Despite its clinical importance, the development of dementia is still difficult to predict at early stages. As cognitive impairments are known to be associated with poor prognoses in PD, olfactory tests may be a useful tool for the management of PD cases especially in advanced stages.

23561981|t|Sweet liking in patients with Parkinson's disease.
23561981|a|Pleasant tastes and odors are considered phylogenetically old natural rewards and their hedonic evaluation is regarded as a good indicator of the reward system function. The primary aim of the present study was to compare pleasantness ratings of sucrose solutions (1-30%, w/w) and sweet liking/disliking status in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and in 20 age-matched healthy controls. In addition, basic sensory aspects of gustatory (intensity ratings, electrogustometric thresholds) and olfactory function (identification abilities in the Sniffin' Stick test) were assessed in both groups. The number of odors rated as pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral was also compared. As expected, the PD patients showed a significant impairment in olfactory identification abilities. There were no differences between the PD patients and controls in electrogustometric thresholds. Rated intensity of higher sucrose concentrations did not differ between the groups. The PD patients tended to rate water taste as more intense in comparison with the controls. Pleasantness ratings of sucrose solutions, the proportion of subjects rating 30% sucrose as the most pleasant (sweet likers), and the number of odors rated as pleasant did not differ between the study groups. The present results suggest that PD does not lead to any obvious alterations in pleasantness ratings of chemosensory stimuli. The study requires replication in larger samples.

23769725|t|Markers of brain illness may be hidden in your olfactory ability: a Japanese perspective.
23769725|a|There is evidence that impaired human cognitive abilities are reflected by loss of olfactory abilities. Declining olfactory perception may be a biomarker for impairment of cognitive function and of impending neurogenerative disorders. As olfactory perception may differ between culture and ethnic group, we sought to confirm this relationship with Japanese participants. In this study, we examined possible relationships between age and olfactory abilities in healthy Japanese subjects (control subjects) over a wide range of ages and compared this relationship with that observed in three neurodegenerative disorders; patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In control subjects, both threshold and recognition abilities decreased with age. Ability to detect odors was generally intact in most control subjects, however, we found that the abilities of individuals in the three different patient populations to recognize odors were impaired relative to control subjects. All three types of patients exhibited decreased or impaired odor-recognition compared with age-matched controls. Previous studies showed the causes of olfactory impairments in PD and AD patients were attributable to pathological changes and MRI signal abnormalities in limbic areas, including the amygdala (AMG), entorhinal cortex (ENT), hippocampus (HI), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Another study reported that DM1 patients have bilateral lesions in anterior temporal areas, including the subcortical white matter, AMG, ENT and insula. Our findings underscore the need to pay careful attention to significant decreases of odor identification abilities caused by diverse forms of abnormal brain function, especially in the AMG, ENT and HI.

23939345|t|Colonic neuropathology is independent of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
23939345|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) and constipation are two frequent and early non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Colonic PD neuropathology, the putative cause of constipation, can be analyzed and quantified using routine colonic biopsies and parallels disease severity. The present study was aimed at investigating whether the severity of neuropathology in the colon in PD is related to OD. Twenty-six PD patients were included. Colonic neuropathology, i.e., the density of Lewy pathology and the number of submucosal neurons, was unrelated to OD as assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification. This suggests that unlike colonic Lewy pathology, OD is unrelated to disease severity.

24200528|t|Olfactory identification and cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
24200528|a|Olfactory impairment constitutes one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. We investigated which aspects of neuropsychological measures are correlated with olfactory identification performance among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Total of 220 participants with mild cognitive impairment (mean age 71.7 years) were examined. Odor identification was assessed using the Open Essence test. Participants underwent comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation, including measures of verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention/executive function, and processing speed. We examined associations between olfactory function and cognitive performance scores. Participants with severe hyposmia exhibited significantly poor verbal and visual memory performance, attention/executive function, and slower processing speed scores compared with those without severe hyposmia. In multivariable logistic regression models, better performance scores on verbal and visual memory were significantly associated with decreased likelihood of severe hyposmia after adjusting for age, sex, education, and other cognitive performance scores. These findings suggest that olfactory impairment might be more closely associated with memory loss compared with other aspects of cognitive functioning in mild cognitive impairment subjects.

24360232|t|Imaging of olfactory bulb and gray matter volumes in brain areas associated with olfactory function in patients with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.
24360232|a|UNLABELLED: We explored if magnetic resonance imaging sequences might aid in the clinical differential diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We measured the volumes of the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tract, and olfaction-associated cortical gray matter in 20 IPD patients, 14 MSA patients, and 12 normal subjects, using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging sequences in combination with voxel-based statistical analysis. We found that, compared to normal subjects and MSA patients, the volumes of the olfactory bulb and tract were significantly reduced in IPD patients. The gray matter volume of IPD patients decreased in the following order: the olfactory area to the right of the piriform cortex, the right amygdala, the left entorhinal cortex, and the left occipital lobe. Further, the total olfactory bulb volume of IPD patients was associated with the duration of disease. The entorhinal cortical gray matter volume was negatively associated with the UPDRS III score. CONCLUSION: Structural volumes measured by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging may potentially be used for differential diagnosis of IPD from MSA.

24769627|t|Disruption of cerebrospinal fluid flow through the olfactory system may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
24769627|a|Plaques and tangles may be manifestations of a more substantial underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease-related changes in the clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and other metabolites suggest this cause may involve cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the interstitial spaces of the brain, including an archaic route through the olfactory system that predates neocortical expansion by three hundred million years. This olfactory CSF conduit (OCC) runs from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) along the lateral olfactory stria, through the olfactory trigone, and down the olfactory tract to the olfactory bulb, where CSF seeps through the cribriform plate to the nasal submucosa. Olfactory dysfunction is common in AD and could be related to alterations in CSF flow along the OCC. Further, reductions in OCC flow may impact CSF hydrodynamics upstream in the MTL and basal forebrain, resulting in less efficient Abeta removal from those areas-among the first affected by neuritic plaques in AD. Factors that reduce CSF drainage across the cribriform plate and slow the clearance of metabolite-laden CSF could include aging-related bone changes, head trauma, inflammation of the nasal epithelium, and toxins that affect olfactory neuron survival and renewal, as well as vascular effects related to diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis-all of which have been linked to AD risk. Problems with CSF-mediated clearance could also provide a link between these seemingly disparate factors and familial AD mutations that induce plaque and tangle formation. I hypothesize that disruptions of CSF flow across the cribriform plate are important early events in AD, and I propose that restoring this flow will enhance the drainage of Abeta oligomers and other metabolites from the MTL.

25012004|t|Comparing the accuracy of different smell identification tests in Parkinson's disease: relevance of cultural aspects.
25012004|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the usefulness of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT), sniffin sticks (SS-16) and brief smell identification test (B-SIT) to assess smell identification in the Mexican population and its accuracy in discriminating subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We included 199 nondemented PD subjects and 199 control subjects matched by gender. Smell identification was tested using the UPSIT and SS-16. Our group obtained B-SIT data from a previous report. RESULTS: The mean number of UPSIT items correctly identified by controls was 27.3+-6; the PD group had a mean score of 19.4+-6. UPSIT had a sensitivity of 82% with a specificity of 66% for a cut-off score of <=25 for detection of PD. The mean number of SS-16 items correctly identified by controls was 10.3+-2.2, while the PD group had 7.4+-2.8 correct answers. For SS-16, sensitivity was 77.8% and specificity of 71.2% when using a cut-off value of <=9. Lemon, turpentine and rose had an identification rate below the 25th percentile for all three tests. Odors with an identification rate above the 75th percentile include banana for all three tests, and gasoline, onion and chocolate for UPSIT and B-SIT. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of the smell tests that were evaluated were lower in comparison to other published reports. Cultural biases and smell familiarity may influence the test results. The development of a true cross-culturally adapted smell identification test is warranted may improve test accuracy.

25154749|t|The brain structural and cognitive basis of odor identification deficits in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
25154749|a|BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between olfactory impairment, cognitive measures, and brain structure volumes in healthy elderly individuals, compared to patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary aim was to elucidate possible differences in cognitive scores and brain structure volumes between aMCI/AD patients with relatively intact odor identification (OI) ability and those with reduced ability. METHODS: Twelve patients with aMCI, six with early AD, and 30 control subjects were included. OI abilities were assessed with the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) and Sniffin Sticks Identification Test (SSIT). Neuropsychological tests of executive functions and memory were performed. Brain structural volumes were obtained from T1 weighted 3D MRI at 3 Tesla. Statistical comparisons between the patients with aMCI and AD indicated no significant differences in performance on most tests. Since the groups were small and AD patients were in an early phase of disease, all patients were subsequently considered together as a single group for studying OI. Patients were subdivided into relatively intact (scores >50%) and reduced OI (<= 50% score) on the olfactory tests. RESULTS: The aMCI/AD group with reduced OI ability, as measured by both B-SIT and SSIT, had significantly smaller hippocampal volume as compared to the patient group with OI scores > 50%. There was a significant association between OI scores and hippocampal volume in the patient (not the control) group. Similar changes with tests of executive function and memory were not found. Low OI scores on B-SIT were associated with conversion from aMCI to AD in patients. The reduced OI patient group was significantly faster on Rey complex figure copying than the fairly intact OI group. CONCLUSION: The results from this pilot study suggest that the reduction in the size of hippocampus in connection with early AD is associated more with loss of OI ability rather than loss of memory, thus demonstrating that impaired OI is an early marker of medial temporal lobe degeneration.

26773700|t|Olfactory dysfunction in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
26773700|a|OBJECTIVE: Several neurodegenerative disorders show olfactory dysfunction. In patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), olfactory impairment is probably due to the involvement of the temporal and orbitofrontal lobes. We hypothesized that due to the disrupted areas in FTD, there would be an impairment in smell identification, differentiation and association. Moreover, we hypothesized that there would be a correlation between the severity of FTD and the severity of odor dysfunction. METHODS: In the current study, we compared odor identification, discrimination and association of nine patients with behavioral variant FTD with eleven healthy controls using the Brief Smell Identification Test and the Odor Perception and Semantics Battery. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences in the odor association test, but not in the identification or discrimination test. There was no correlation between disease severity and the performance in the odor tests. CONCLUSION: We showed impairment of odor association that is most likely due to disruption of specific associative areas involved in olfactory processing. Specifically, we propose that the impairment may well be due to disrupted areas in the temporal lobe and amygdala.

27028329|t|Motor and Nonmotor Features of Carriers of the p.A53T Alpha-Synuclein Mutation: A Longitudinal Study.
27028329|a|BACKGROUND: G209A SNCA mutation carriers represent an important group of genetic PD. We describe motor and nonmotor features of G209A SNCA mutation carriers. METHODS: Longitudinal clinical assessments over 2 years were collected in 22 symptomatic and 8 asymptomatic G209A SNCA mutation carriers. Motor and nonmotor rating scales were administered. Correlations were performed between clinical variables and disease duration or age. Penetrance was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: Asymptomatic carriers did not manifest clear premotor symptoms, but symptomatic carriers often reported that olfactory dysfunction and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder preceded motor symptoms. Prominent motor decline and deterioration of autonomic and cognitive function occurred at follow-up; such nonmotor features correlated with disease duration, but not age. Disease penetrance was estimated at around 90%. CONCLUSIONS: This study may help to inform clinical trials and provide the basis for studies of disease modifiers in genetic synucleinopathy cohorts.   2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

27729202|t|Equating scores of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and Sniffin' Sticks test in patients with Parkinson's disease.
27729202|a|BACKGROUND: Impaired olfaction is an important feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurological diseases. A variety of smell identification tests exist such as "Sniffin' Sticks" and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). An important part of research is being able to replicate findings or combining studies in a meta-analysis. This is difficult if olfaction has been measured using different metrics. We present conversion methods between the: UPSIT, Sniffin' 16, and Brief-SIT (B-SIT); and Sniffin' 12 and Sniffin' 16 odour identification tests. METHODS: We used two incident cohorts of patients with PD who were tested with either the Sniffin' 16 (n = 1131) or UPSIT (n = 980) and a validation dataset of 128 individuals who took both tests. We used the equipercentile and Item Response Theory (IRT) methods to equate the olfaction scales. RESULTS: The equipercentile conversion suggested some bias between UPSIT and Sniffin' 16 tests across the two groups. The IRT method shows very good characteristics between the true and converted Sniffin' 16 (delta mean = 0.14, median = 0) based on UPSIT. The equipercentile conversion between the Sniffin' 12 and 16 item worked well (delta mean = 0.01, median = 0). The UPSIT to B-SIT conversion showed evidence of bias but amongst PD cases worked well (mean delta = -0.08, median = 0). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that one can convert UPSIT to B-SIT or Sniffin' 16, and Sniffin' 12 to 16 scores in a valid way. This can facilitate direct comparison between tests aiding future collaborative analyses and evidence synthesis.

28684764|t|Heterogeneity of odorant identification impairment in patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
28684764|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibit olfactory dysfunction. However, the olfactory declineti precise nature is not fully understood. One hundred patients (60 AD, 28 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 12 Normal) were enrolled. All participants underwent olfactory function testing using an odour stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J). OSIT-J scores were significantly correlated with recall. We classified OSIT-J odorants into three groups: Category I, odorants that were difficult for normal aged subjects to identify; Category II, odorants that became harder to accurately identify with cognitive decline; and Category III, odorants that even AD patients could identify. We defined a "cognitive subset" consisting of six Category II OSIT-J odorants (perfume, rose, Japanese cypress, curry, India ink and gas leak odour). The ability to identify "cognitive subset" odours was significantly better indicator of cognitive status than the ability to identify "non-cognitive subset", which consisted of the six remaining items. The ability to identify the gas leak odorant was decreased early in the aMCI stage, suggesting a need to reconsider the odours used to signal gas leaks. The "cognitive subset" would provide a more convenient and effective biomarker for diagnosing dementia in clinical settings.

29037152|t|Low plasma tryptophan is associated with olfactory function in healthy elderly community dwellers in Japan.
29037152|a|BACKGROUND: Decreased circulating tryptophan (Trp) levels are frequently observed in elderly patients with neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's disease. Trp may serve as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease risk in elderly people. We aimed to investigate the association between low plasma Trp levels and olfactory function, which is known to predict age-related diseases including dementia in elderly people. METHODS: A total of 144 healthy elderly Japanese community (>= 65 years old) dwellers from the Health, Aging and Nutritional Improvement study (HANI study) were the subjects of our analysis. Low Trp levels were classified using the lower limit values of the reference interval according to a previous report. Olfactory function was assessed using a card-type test called Open Essence, which includes 12 odour items that are familiar to Japanese people. The elderly subjects with low circulating Trp levels were compared to a control group with normal plasma Trp levels. RESULTS: We conducted the analyses using 144 people aged 65 years or older (mean age 73.7 +- 5.5 years; 36.1% men). The subjects showed normal serum albumin levels (4.4 +- 0.2 g/dL) and no daily living disabilities. Low plasma Trp levels (low Trp group) were found in 11.1% of the study population. The low Trp group showed a significantly lower correct-answer rate for the items india ink, perfume, curry and sweaty smelling socks than control group (P < 0.05). There was also a significant association between low Trp levels and low olfactory ability, after adjusting for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Lower plasma Trp levels were associated with a decrease in olfactory function in functionally competent older individuals. Because olfactory dysfunction predicts age-related diseases, low plasma Trp levels may represent a clinical sign of disease risk in elderly people.

29107844|t|The mechanisms underlying olfactory deficits in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice: focus on olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb.
29107844|a|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is highly expressed in the central nervous system including the olfactory epithelium (OE) and olfactory bulb (OB). ApoE induction is beneficial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, whereas ApoE deficiency results in impaired olfaction, but the timing and underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. Uncovering the mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in ApoE-deficient mice might provide a potential avenue for the early diagnosis of AD. We used an ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mouse model and a cookie-finding test to reveal an olfactory deficit in 3- to 5-month-old, but not 1- to 2-month-old, ApoE-/- mice. Electrophysiological experiments indicated a significant decline in the electroolfactogram (EOG) amplitude, which was associated with an increase in rise time in ApoE-/- mice. Knockout mice also exhibited compromised olfactory adaptation, as well as a reduced number of mature olfactory sensory neurons in the OE. Local field potential recording in the OB showed that gamma oscillation power was enhanced, which might be attributed to an increase in GABAergic inhibition mediated by parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. This study demonstrates the critical involvement of ApoE in olfactory information processing in the OE and OB. ApoE deficiency results in olfaction deficits in mice as young as 3 months old, which has implications for AD pathogenesis.

29185867|t|Change of olfactory function as a marker of inflammatory activity and disability progression in MS.
29185867|a|BACKGROUND: Impaired olfactory threshold has been reported in early inflammatory phases of MS, while impaired odor identification was associated with more widespread disability. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the development of olfactory function and its correlation with relapse and disability progression. METHODS: In this prospective, 3-year longitudinal study on 151 MS patients and 30 healthy controls, three different qualities of olfactory function (threshold, discrimination, and identification) were quantified using the Sniffin' Sticks test. The influence of relapses and disability on olfactory function was analyzed at different time points and in a multivariate model. RESULTS: Discrimination and identification capability significantly worsened over 3 years, while threshold did not. Threshold was markedly impaired in patients with relapse activity within 12 months, recovered in the absence of relapse, and was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of relapse. Deterioration of discrimination and identification was irreversible and both strongly associated with and predictive of EDSS progression. CONCLUSION: Olfactory function changes over time in MS. Threshold impairment is transient and predicts inflammatory disease activity, while odor identification and discrimination are associated with disability progression. Olfactory dysfunction might be a useful and easily obtainable parameter to monitor patients with regard to inflammation and neurodegeneration in MS.

29254084|t|Hedonic Assessment of Odors: A Comparison of Two Sensory Scales for Use with Alzheimer's Disease Patients and Elderly Individuals.
29254084|a|BACKGROUND: Several clinical studies concerning the olfactory function of patients with cognitive impairment have used sensory scales to investigate hedonic perception. However, no study has focused on the choice of the most appropriate sensory hedonic scale for the individuals with neurodegenerative disorders or other psychiatric diseases involving cognitive deficits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to use two hedonic scales (category scale and linear scale) and compare their discriminatory capacity, repeatability, and ease of use. This should allow us to identify the most appropriate hedonic scale for patients with AD. METHODS: We recruited 18 patients with mild to moderate AD, and 20 healthy volunteers matched for gender, age, smoking status, and educational level. The participants underwent a clinical assessment and hedonic evaluation of three odorants (pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral), using a five-point category scale and a 10-cm linear scale with a marked mid-point. RESULTS: AD patients were able to use hedonic scales as well as paired healthy elderly subjects. The linear scale performed slightly better in terms of ease of use for both patients and healthy controls and discriminatory capacity for AD patients. The results for AD patients and controls with both scales were repeatable. CONCLUSION: The linear scale may be more appropriate for AD patients pending further studies involving a larger population of patients, using several odorants.

29383614|t|Comparison of odor identification among amnestic and non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive decline, and early Alzheimer's dementia.
29383614|a|Olfactory impairment might be an important clinical marker and predictor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we aimed to compare the degree of olfactory identification impairment in each mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtype, subjective memory impairment, and early AD dementia and assessed the relationship between olfactory identification and cognitive performance. We consecutively included 50 patients with amnestic MCI, 28 patients with non-amnestic MCI, 20 patients with mild AD, and 17 patients with subjective memory impairment (SMI). All patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments. A multiple choice olfactory identification cross-cultural smell identification test was also utilized. Controlling for age and gender, olfactory impairment was significantly more severe in patients with AD and amnestic MCI compared with the results from the non-amnestic MCI and SMI groups. Higher scores on MMSE, verbal and non-verbal memory, and frontal executive function tests were significantly related to olfactory identification ability. In conclusion, olfactory identification is impaired in amnestic MCI and AD. These findings are consistent with previous studies. In amnestic MCI patients, this dysfunction is considered to be caused by underlying AD pathology.

29554341|t|Cognitive Impairment and Structural Abnormalities in Late Life Depression with Olfactory Identification Impairment: an Alzheimer's Disease-Like Pattern.
29554341|a|Background: Late-life depression patients are at a high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and diminished olfactory identification is an indicator in early screening for Alzheimer's disease in the elderly. However, whether diminished olfactory identification is associated with risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in late-life depression patients remains unclear. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five late-life depression patients, 50 Alzheimer's disease patients, and 60 normal controls were continuously recruited. The participants underwent a clinical evaluation, olfactory test, neuropsychological assessment, and neuroimaging assessment. Results: The olfactory identification impairment in late-life depression patients was milder than that in Alzheimer's disease patients. Diminished olfactory identification was significantly correlated with worse cognitive performance (global function, memory language, executive function, and attention) and reduced grey matter volume (olfactory bulb and hippocampus) in the late-life depression patients. According to a multiple linear regression analysis, olfactory identification was significantly associated with the memory scores in late-life depression group (B=1.623, P<.001). The late-life depression with olfactory identification impairment group had worse cognitive performance (global, memory, language, and executive function) and more structural abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease-related regions than the late-life depression without olfactory identification impairment group, and global cognitive function and logical memory in the late-life depression without olfactory identification impairment group was intact. Reduced volume observed in many areas (hippocampus, precuneus, etc.) in the Alzheimer's disease group was also observed in late-life depression with olfactory identification impairment group but not in the late-life depression without olfactory identification impairment group. Conclusion: The patterns of cognitive impairment and structural abnormalities in late-life depression with olfactory identification impairment patients were similar to those in Alzheimer's disease; olfactory identification may help identify late-life depression patients who are at a high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

30058142|t|Hyposmia in a simple smell test is associated with accelerated cognitive decline in early Parkinson's disease.
30058142|a|OBJECTIVES: Olfactory dysfunction has been related to cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD), but evidence is conflicting and little is known about the relationship between these symptoms in early PD. Our objective was to study the association between smell deficits measured with a simple odor identification test at diagnosis of PD and the subsequent risk of cognitive decline. MATERIALS & METHODS: One hundred and ninety two PD patients from a population-based study were examined at time of diagnosis, before initiation of dopaminergic treatment, with follow-up of 177 patients after 3 years, 162 patients after 5 years and 146 patients after 7 years. Cognitive function was assessed repeatedly with tests of global cognition, verbal memory, visuospatial abilities, processing speed, and executive function. Olfactory function was tested with a simple odor identification test at baseline. Associations between outcome measures and hyposmia were assessed by linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: After 7 years, there were significant differences in global cognition (B: 1.96 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.24), P = 0.0031), verbal memory including immediate recall (B: 5.36 (95% CI: 2.04, 8.67), P = 0.0018) and delayed recall (B: 1.55 (95% CI: 0.51, 2.59), P = 0.0041) and word reading speed (B: 6.90 (95% CI: 2.17, 11.63), P = 0.0048) between hyposmic and normosmic PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The decline of cognitive function in early PD is more rapid in patients with hyposmia at diagnosis, compared to normosmic ones. A simple smell test may contribute to identify patients at risk of accelerated decline in global cognition, verbal memory, and processing speed within the first 7 years from diagnosis.

30236169|t|Identification of odors, faces, cities and naming of objects in patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer s disease: a longitudinal study.
30236169|a|ABSTRACTObjective:Recent studies have tried to find a reliable way of predicting the development of Alzheimer s Disease (AD) among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often focusing on olfactory dysfunction or semantic memory. Our study aimed to validate these findings while also comparing the predictive accuracy of olfactory and semantic assessments for this purpose. METHOD: Six hundred fifty patients (median age 68, 58% females) including controls, SCD (subjective cognitive decline), non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), amnestic MCI (aMCI), and AD patients were tested for olfactory dysfunction by means of odor identification testing and semantic memory. Of those 650 patients, 120 participants with SCD, naMCI, or aMCI at baseline underwent a follow-up examination after two years on average. Of these 120 patients, 12% had developed AD at follow-up (converters), while 88% did not develop AD at follow-up (non-converters). RESULTS: Analysis showed a significant difference only for initial olfactory identification between converters and non-converters. Sensitivity of impairment of olfactory identification for AD prediction was low at 46.2%, although specificity was high at 81.9%. Semantic memory impairment at baseline was not significantly related to AD conversion, although, when naming objects, significant differences were found between AD patients and all other groups and between naMCI and aMCI patients compared to controls and SCD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Objective olfactory assessments are promising instruments for predicting the conversion to AD among MCI patients. However, due to their low sensitivity and high specificity, a combination with other neuropsychological tests might lead to an improved predictive accuracy. Further longitudinal studies with more participants are required to investigate the usefulness of semantic memory tests in this case.

30347619|t|Analyses of Clinical Features and Investigations on Potential Mechanisms in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Olfactory Dysfunction.
30347619|a|BACKGROUND: OD is common in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between OD and clinical symptoms and the potential mechanisms of OD in AD patients are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between OD and clinical symptoms and the potential mechanisms of OD in AD patients. METHODS: We evaluated OD using the Hyposmia Rating Scale (HRS), classified patients into AD with OD (AD-OD) and AD with no OD (AD-NOD) groups, and detected the levels of free radicals and inflammatory factors, including hydroxyl radical ( OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E2 in serum from AD patients. RESULTS: It was shown that the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Animal Fluency Test, Boston Naming Test (BNT), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test-delayed recall were all significantly lower and the score of overall activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL were significantly higher in AD-OD group than those in AD-NOD group. Compared with AD-NOD group,  OH level in serum was prominently elevated, and H2O2 level was dramatically declined in AD-OD group. In the correlation analysis, HRS score was significantly and positively correlated with the score of BNT, and negatively correlated with  OH level in serum. CONCLUSIONS: AD-OD patients suffered from severe cognitive impairment in the domain of language. Oxidative stress might be correlated with AD-OD featured by the drastically increased  OH level in serum.

30902575|t|Olfactory deficit is associated with mitral cell dysfunction in the olfactory bulb of P301S tau transgenic mice.
30902575|a|Neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) are the neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and olfaction disorder is an early symptom of AD. However, the link between P-tau aggregation and olfaction disorder remains unclear. In this study, the expression of P-tau in the olfactory bulb (OB), particularly in the mitral cell layer (MCL), external plexiform layer (EPL), and granule cell layer (GCL), of AD patients was found to be significantly higher than that in the OB of normal aging subjects, which suggested that these layers in the OB were susceptible to P-tau. The P301S tau transgenic mice (P301S mice) exhibit AD-like features, which can be characterized by olfactory dysfunction that precedes cognitive disorder. Importantly, the excessive P-tau expression in the OB of P301S mice, particularly in MCs, was associated with MC loss at 9 months of age, and decreased MC firing activities started to be observed at 2 months of age. Our results revealed that MCs might contribute to olfactory dysfunction in P301S mice. Furthermore, we described an aberrant dendro-dendritic synaptic structure between granule cells (GCs) and MCs and abnormal gamma oscillations in the EPL of the OB, and these findings indicated that P-tau might disrupt the regulation of MCs by GCs in P301S mice starting at 5 months of age. These data showed that the reduction in the MC firing frequency at 2 months of age might not be caused by GC suppression. Based on these findings, we speculated that MCs are a putative target for the treatment of P-tau-induced early olfactory dysfunction, and thus, an exploration of the specific causes and mechanisms of MC functional changes in P301S mice is crucial.

31053960|t|Screening performance of abbreviated versions of the UPSIT smell test.
31053960|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia can develop with age and in neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is a 40-item smell test widely used for assessing hyposmia. However, in a number of situations, such as identifying hyposmic individuals in large populations, shorter tests are preferable. METHODS: We assessed the ability of shorter UPSIT subsets to detect hyposmia in 891 healthy participants from the PREDICT-PD study. Shorter subsets included Versions A and B of the 4-item Pocket Smell Test (PST) and 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Using a data-driven approach, we evaluated screening performances of 23,231,378 combinations of 1-7 smell items from the full UPSIT to derive "winning" subsets, and validated findings separately in another 191 healthy individuals. We then compared discriminatory UPSIT smells between PREDICT-PD participants and 40 PD patients, and assessed the performance of "winning" subsets containing discriminatory smells in PD patients. RESULTS: PST Versions A and B achieved sensitivity/specificity of 76.8%/64.9% and 86.6%/45.9%, respectively, while BSIT Versions A and B achieved 83.1%/79.5% and 96.5%/51.8%. From the data-driven analysis, 2 "winning" 7-item subsets surpassed the screening performance of 12-item BSITs (validation sensitivity/specificity of 88.2%/85.4% and 100%/53.5%), while a "winning" 4-item subset had higher sensitivity than PST-A, -B, and even BSIT-A (validation sensitivity 91.2%). Interestingly, several discriminatory smells featured within "winning" subsets, and demonstrated high-screening performances for identifying hyposmic PD patients. CONCLUSION: Using abbreviated smell tests could provide a cost-effective means of large-scale hyposmia screening, allowing more targeted UPSIT administration in general and PD-related settings.

31236405|t|Hyposmia as a Predictive Marker of Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
31236405|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia is one of the most common and best-characterized conditions that is also one of the first nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The association of hyposmia with PD is widely accepted; however the likelihood of developing PD is unclear. Our meta-analysis aimed to investigate the risk of PD in individuals with hyposmia. METHODS: Prospective studies on humans published before December 4th, 2018, were searched for in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Two independent reviewers screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the quality of studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and pooled data for analysis using random-effects models. RESULTS: Of the 1774 studies retrieved, seven met the inclusion criteria for this review. A total of 3272 hyposmia and 176 PD events were reported over follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 17 years. Hyposmia was associated with a 3.84-fold risk of developing PD (pooled relative risk: 3.84, 95% CI 2.12-6.95). Subgroup analyses identified few differences between different hyposmia assessment methodologies and follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that deficiencies in olfaction are associated with an increased risk of developing PD. Future studies are needed to investigate whether hyposmia is a promising and feasible biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD.

31242486|t|Association of Smell Identification Deficit with Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Japanese Version Scores and Brain Atrophy in Patients with Dementia.
31242486|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may be related to disorder of the central olfactory processing system. In this work, therefore, we examined the relationships between olfactory changes and the most affected cognitive domain or degree of brain atrophy in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: The subjects were 55 AD patients and 27 MCI patients. Smell identification tests were performed using Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese -(OSIT-J). The severity and nature of cognitive dysfunctions were evaluated using the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, Japanese version (ADAS-Jcog). MRI with voxel-based specific regional analysis system for AD software was used for evaluation of brain atrophy. RESULTS: -OSIT-J scores were significantly correlated with total -ADAS-Jcog scores, as well as with ADAS-Jcog subscale items of word recall task, orientation (memory domain) and ideational praxis. Smell identification deficit was proportional to the degree of atrophy of the medial temporal lobe. CONCLUSION: Smell identification deficit in AD/MCI is strongly associated with the memory domain of cognitive function and with atrophy of the medial temporal lobe.

31531013|t|Sudden Intrabulbar Amyloid Increase Simultaneously Disrupts Olfactory Bulb Oscillations and Odor Detection.
31531013|a|There seems to be a correlation between soluble amyloid beta protein (Abeta) accumulation in the main olfactory bulb (OB) and smell deterioration in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and animal models. Moreover, this loss of smell appears to be related to alterations in neural network activity in several olfactory-related circuits, including the OB, as has been observed in anesthetized animals and brain slices. It is possible that there is a correlation between these two pathological phenomena, but a direct and simultaneous evaluation of the acute and direct effect of Abeta on OB activity while animals are actually smelling has not been performed. Thus, here, we tested the effects of acute intrabulbar injection of Abeta at a low dose (200 pmol) on the OB local field potential before and during the presence of a hidden piece of smelly food. Our results show that Abeta decreases the power of OB network activity while impairing the animal's ability to reach the hidden food. We found a strong relationship between the power of the OB oscillations and the correlation between OBs and the olfactory detection test scores. These findings provide a direct link between Abeta-induced OB network dysfunction and smell loss in rodents, which could be extrapolated to AD patients.

31676975|t|Machine-learning-derived rules set excludes risk of Parkinson's disease in patients with olfactory or gustatory symptoms with high accuracy.
31676975|a|BACKGROUND: Chemosensory loss is a symptom of Parkinson's disease starting already at preclinical stages. Their appearance without an identifiable etiology therefore indicates a possible early symptom of Parkinson's disease. Supervised machine-learning was used to identify parameters that predict Parkinson's disease among patients having sought medical advice for chemosensory symptoms. METHODS: Olfactory, gustatory and demographic parameters were analyzed in 247 patients who had reported for chemosensory symptoms. Unsupervised machine-learning, implanted as so-called fast and frugal decision trees, was applied to map these parameters to a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease queried for in median 9 years after the first interview. RESULTS: A symbolic hierarchical decision rule-based classifier was created that comprised d = 5 parameters, including scores in tests of odor discrimination, odor identification and olfactory thresholds, the age at which the chemosensory loss has been noticed, and a familial history of Parkinson's disease. The rule set provided a cross-validated negative predictive performance of Parkinson's disease of 94.1%; however, its balanced accuracy to predict the disease was only 58.9% while robustly above guessing. CONCLUSIONS: Applying machine-learning techniques, a classifier was developed that took the shape of a set of six hierarchical rules with binary decisions about olfaction-related features or a familial burden of Parkinson's disease. Its main clinical strength lies in the exclusion of the possibility of developing Parkinson's disease in a patient with olfactory or gustatory loss.

31766000|t|Olfactory identification associates with cognitive function and the third ventricle width in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
31766000|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a known clinical feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). Some studies have shown that odor identification impairment is an essential feature associated with cognitive function in MS. This study investigates the relationship between olfactory identification and the disease state, including cognitive function and central brain volume, to evaluate the utility of olfactory identification in the clinical assessment of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. METHODS: Forty patients with RRMS and 40 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Their olfactory identification was measured using the Odor Stick Identification Test for the Japanese (OSIT-J). Cognitive function was evaluated by the Japanese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition (WAIS-III), and depressive mood was evaluated by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the third ventricle width (3rd VW) as a marker of central brain atrophy. RESULTS: RRMS patients had a significantly lower OSIT-J score than HCs. The OSIT-J score was significantly lower in RRMS patients with low processing speed (PS) and working memory (WM) scores than RRMS patients with normal PS or WM scores. The OSIT-J score was significantly related to the PS, WM, and the 3rd VW. The OSIT-J score also showed a mild correlation with the expanded disability status scale and disease duration, but not with the number of clinical attacks or patient's age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that olfactory identification impairment occurs in association with cognitive dysfunction and central brain atrophy. Thus, olfactory identification is a possible disease marker of RRMS as with cognitive impairment, especially PS, reflecting the diffuse neurodegeneration in RRMS.

31864071|t|Midbrain hyperechogenicity, hyposmia, mild parkinsonian signs and risk for incident Parkinson's disease over 10 years: A prospective population-based study.
31864071|a|INTRODUCTION: Associations of substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity on transcranial sonography, olfactory dysfunction, and mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) with incident Parkinson's disease (PD) have only been studied over limited periods of follow-up and their long-term predictive properties are unclear. We aimed to prospectively assess the risk for incident PD over 10 years in community-dwelling elderly individuals with these risk markers. METHODS: SN-hyperechogenicity, olfactory function, and MPS were assessed in the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (2005 in-person assessment; n = 574, aged 55-94 years). Cases of incident PD were identified at 5-year and 10-year follow-up visits. We estimated relative risks of baseline markers for incident cases. RESULTS: After excluding 35 cases with PD or secondary parkinsonism at baseline, a total of 20 cases of incident PD were identified from the remaining 539 participants (11 at 5 years and 9 at 10 years). Relative risks for incident PD over the 10-year follow-up period were 7.43 (2.71-20.39), 3.60 (1.48-8.78), and 5.52 (2.43-12.57) for baseline SN-hyperechogenicity, hyposmia, and mild parkinsonian signs, respectively. While risk of hyposmia for incident PD was similar for the two sequential 5-year periods studied, relative risks of SN-hyperechogenicity and MPS were higher for the first five years as compared to later. CONCLUSION: Our findings extend the established risk relationship of SN-hyperechogenicity, hyposmia, and MPS with incident PD beyond 5 years of follow-up.

32216773|t|Detection and recognition thresholds for five basic tastes in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia.
32216773|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) are thought to exhibit taste disorders; however, this has not been extensively studied. We investigated gustatory functions and factors affecting taste in patients with ADD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in non-demented controls (NDCs) and evaluated associations between cognitive impairment and gustatory functions. METHODS: We recruited 29 patients with ADD, 43 with MCI, and 14 with NDCs. We obtained medical and medication history, measured salivary secretion volumes, and performed cognitive function tests, blood tests, whole-mouth gustatory tests, and dietary and gustatory questionnaires. RESULTS: Patients with ADD showed significantly higher recognition threshold values than NDCs (p < 0.05). Many individuals did not recognize umami at the maximum concentration, and this happened more frequently in patients with ADD or MCI than in NDCs. Evaluation items other than cognitive function tests did not show significant differences among the groups, but many individuals had decreased salivation, low serum zinc levels, and were on multiple medications. We found a significant correlation between recognition threshold and age (r = 0.229, p < 0.05) and cognitive function test score (r = 0.268, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ADD showed impairment of gustatory function. Gustatory impairment in patients with MCI could not be confirmed. However, many individuals with MCI did not recognize umami, either. Our results suggest that taste disorders in elderly people with cognitive decline occur independently of factors affecting taste such as salivation, zinc levels, or prescription drugs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry on February 10, 2017, with reference number UMIN000026087.

32665636|t|Effect of A/T/N imaging biomarkers on impaired odor identification in Alzheimer's disease.
32665636|a|Odor identification ability may serve as an important diagnostic biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study is to investigate the contribution of A/T/N neuroimaging biomarkers to impaired odor identification ability in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum. In 127 participants, we compared A/T/N neuroimaging biomarkers between normosmia and hyposmia groups, and performed correlation analysis between the biomarkers and Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CCSIT) scores. Additionally, path analysis for odor identification ability was performed using cognitive function as a mediator. In between-group comparison, individuals with hyposmia showed higher frequency of amyloid-beta (Abeta) positivity, and lower neuropsychological test performance than those with normosmia. After correction for covariates including total cognition scores, there was no difference in the Abeta or tau burden between the normosmia and hyposmia groups, and no correlation between CCSIT scores and Abeta or tau burden. Meanwhile, cortical volumes in the lateral and medial temporal cortices were smaller in the hyposmia group and decreased with the worsening of CCSIT scores. Path analysis showed that only neurodegeneration had a direct effect on odor identification, while Abeta and tau burden contributed to odor identification with the mediation of cognition. In the Alzheimer's disease spectrum, impaired odor identification ability may be attributable to neurodegeneration rather than the direct effect of Abeta or tau burden.

33662859|t|COVID-19 in a temporal relation to the onset of multiple sclerosis.
33662859|a|Neurological complications of COVID-19 have been described. We present the case of a 27-year-old woman who developed COVID-19 in April 2020. She continued to present anosmia and ageusia eight months later. Six months after contracting COVID-19, she developed dysesthesia, hypoesthesia and hyperreflexia. Her magnetic resonance imaging showed demyelinating lesions, of which two were enhanced by gadolinium. She was positive for oligoclonal bands in her spinal fluid. This patient developed multiple sclerosis with a temporal relationship to COVID-19. We believe that SARS-CoV-2 led to her autoimmune disease through a virus-induced neuroimmunopathological condition.

34507271|t|GABAA receptor agonist muscimol rescues inhibitory microcircuit defects in the olfactory bulb and improves olfactory function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
34507271|a|Olfactory damage develops at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are shown to impair inhibitory circuits in the olfactory bulb (OB), its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the olfactory dysfunction due to impaired inhibitory transmission to mitral cells (MCs) of the OB in APP/PS1 mice. Using electrophysiological studies, we found that MCs exhibited increased spontaneous firing rates as early as 3 months, much before development of Abeta deposits in the brain. Furthermore, the frequencies but not amplitudes of MC inhibitory postsynaptic currents decreased markedly, suggesting that presynaptic GABA release is impaired while postsynaptic GABAA receptor responses remain intact. Notably, muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, improved odor identification and discrimination behaviors in APP/PS1 mice, reduced MC basal firing activity, and rescued inhibitory circuits along with reducing the Abeta burden in the OB. Our study links the presynaptic deficits of GABAergic transmission to olfactory dysfunction and subsequent AD development and implicates the therapeutic potential of maintaining local inhibitory microcircuits against early AD progression.

35491487|t|A 47-Year-Old Japanese Woman with Symptoms of Increased Salty and Reduced Sweet Taste Perception Preceding a Diagnosis of Thymoma-Associated Myasthenia Gravis.
35491487|a|BACKGROUND Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder, which is often accompanied by various complications. Partial dysgeusia is an uncommon nonmotor symptom of MG, and dysgeusia preceding typical MG symptoms is rare. Although ageusia and hypogeusia have been reported in patients with MG, increased perception of taste has not been reported. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old Japanese woman presented with a reduced perception of sweet taste and an increased perception of salty taste. Meanwhile, she was diagnosed with thymoma-associated generalized MG and underwent extended thymectomy. Three months later, her anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody (Ab) titer increased to 70 nmol/L, when she had completely lost perception of sweet taste and had developed a markedly increased perception of salty taste. Prednisolone and tacrolimus were then added to the medication, and her partial dysgeusia gradually improved. As the AChR Ab titer decreased, disturbance of sweet taste resolved, although a slight decrease persisted. The increased perception of salty taste returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS This is a rare case of a patient with MG who developed an increased salty taste perception with a reduced sweet taste perception 3 months before the onset of her motor symptoms. We suggest that MG should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with partial dysgeusia but no motor symptoms.

35871337|t|The Neuroanatomic Correlates of Olfactory Identification Impairment in Healthy Older Adults and in Persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
35871337|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory identification (OI) impairment appears early in the course of Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), prior to detectable cognitive impairment. However, the neuroanatomical correlates of impaired OI in cognitively normal older adults (CN) and persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: We examined the neuroanatomic correlates of OI impairment in older adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS). METHODS: Our sample included 1,600 older adults without dementia who completed clinical assessment and structural brain imaging from 2011 to 2013. We characterized OI impairment using the 12-item Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test (score <=6). We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and region of interest (ROI) analyses to examine the neuroanatomic correlates of impaired OI in CN and MCI, after adjusting for potential confounders. Analyses were also separately stratified by race and sex. RESULTS: In CN, OI impairment was associated with smaller amygdala gray matter (GM) volume (p < 0.05). In MCI, OI impairment was associated with smaller GM volumes of the olfactory cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and insula (ps < 0.05). Differential associations were observed by sex in MCI; OI impairment was associated with lower insular GM volumes among men but not among women (p-interaction = 0.04). There were no meaningful interactions by race. CONCLUSION: The brain regions associated with OI impairment in individuals without dementia are specifically those regions known to be the primary targets of AD pathogenic processes. These findings highlight the potential utility of olfactory assessment in the identification and stratification of older adults at risk for AD.

36257619|t|Evaluation of the complete Sniffin Sticks Test versus its subtests in differentiating Parkinson's disease patients from healthy controls.
36257619|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia is one of the most common, as well as the first nonmotor condition in Parkinson disease (PD). The sniffin sticks test (SST) evaluates three different aspects of olfactory function: threshold (T), discrimination (D), and identification (I). The sum of the scores of these three subtests produce a global score of olfaction, the Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if the TDI score or one of its subtests is better to discriminate PD patients from controls. METHODS: We recruited 27 PD patients and 17 healthy age-matched controls (HC) who were evaluated through a clinical interview, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Movement Disorders Society - Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale. The olfaction was assessed using the complete SST. RESULTS: The performance of PD patients on the olfactory test was significantly worse when compared with the HC (T: 3.0 vs. 6.5, p < 0.001; D: 8.1 vs. 11.2, p < 0.001; I: 7.3 vs. 11.7, p < 0.001; TDI: 18.8 vs. 29.9, p < 0.001). The prevalence of olfaction impairment in our study (PD: 100%, and HC: 56%) was greater than that found in the literature. Cognition influenced the performance on TDI. The olfactory subtests were impaired proportionally between patients and controls. Furthermore, D and I were correlated, but only in PD patients. The TDI showed a tendency to better discriminate PD patients from HC, when compared with its subtests. CONCLUSIONS: Although the complete olfactory evaluation is time consuming, it seems to be a superior tool to identify olfaction impairment in PD patients, when compared with the isolated subtests.

36849448|t|Updated Percentiles for the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test in Adults 50 Years of Age and Older.
36849448|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is commonly used to assess olfaction and screen for early detection of disorders including Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease. Our objective was to develop updated percentiles, based on substantially larger samples than previous norms, to more finely discriminate age- and sex-specific UPSIT performance among >=50-year-old adults who may be candidates for studies of prodromal neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: The UPSIT was administered cross-sectionally to participants recruited between 2007-2010 and 2013-2015 for the Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome (PARS) and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort studies, respectively. Exclusion criteria included age <50 years and a confirmed or suspected PD diagnosis. Demographics, family history, and prodromal features of PD including self-reported hyposmia were collected. Normative data including means, standard deviations, and percentiles were derived by age and sex. RESULTS: The analytic sample included 9,396 individuals (5,336 females, 4,060 males), aged 50-95, who were predominantly White, non-Hispanic US residents. UPSIT percentiles were derived and are provided across seven age categories (50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, and >=80) for females and males separately; relative to existing norms, subgroups included between 2.4-20 times as many participants. Olfactory function declined with age and was better among women than men; accordingly, the percentile corresponding to a given raw score varied markedly by age and sex. UPSIT performance was comparable among individuals with vs without first-degree family history of PD. Comparisons of self-reported hyposmia vs UPSIT percentiles indicated a strong association (chi-squared P<0.0001), but minimal agreement (Cohen's simple kappa [95% CI]: = 0.32 [0.28-0.36] for females; 0.34 [0.30-0.38] for males). DISCUSSION: Updated age/sex-specific UPSIT percentiles are provided for >=50-year-old adults who reflect a population likely to be recruited into studies of prodromal neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings highlight the potential advantages of evaluating olfaction relative to age and sex instead of in absolute terms (e.g., based on raw UPSIT scores) or based on subjective (i.e., self-reported) measures. This information addresses the need to support studies of disorders including PD and Alzheimer's disease by providing updated normative data from a larger sample of older adults.

36917318|t|Olfactory identification, cognition, depressive symptoms, and 5-year mortality in patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.
36917318|a|OBJECTIVE: An association between odor and cognitive impairment has been shown in many studies. The objective of the present hospital-based, single-center retrospective study was to assess the impact of odor impairment on the mortality of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Odor function was measured by Sniffin Sticks (Burghart Messtechnik, Holm, Germany) and the assessment of self-reported olfactory functioning and olfaction-related quality of life (ASOF) test. Cognitive performance was assessed by an extensive neuropsychological test battery, symptoms of depression were diagnosed with the Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS). The influence of demographic factors such as gender, age, and education were examined. RESULTS: Although the univariate analyses and pairwise post hoc comparison showed significant differences for some of the olfactory performance tests/subtests, the multivariate models showed no association between olfactory test performance and mortality among patients with cognitive impairment. "Attention," a domain of the Neuropsychological Test Battery Vienna (NTBV), as well as depressive symptoms, gender, and age, showed a significant influence on the mortality of the patient group. CONCLUSION: Lower olfactory performance showed no impact on mortality. However, decreased cognitive function of "Attention" can be considered as an influential predictor for mortality.

37461169|t|A Lower Rate of Hyposmia in Non-Ashkenazi Jewish Patients with Parkinson's Disease: Motor and Non-motor Disease Characteristics in Different Ethnic Groups in Israel.
37461169|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about phenotypical variations among ethnic groups in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Israel. Clinical characteristics of non-Ashkenazi Jews (NAJ) are scantly described. OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical aspects of PD in ethnic groups in Israel, focusing on NAJ and Ashkenazi Jews (AJ). METHODS: In this cross-sectional retrospective study, we collected demographic, genetic, and clinical characteristics of patients from different ethnic Jewish backgrounds. Ethnic groups included AJ; North African Jews (NAFJ); oriental Jews (OJ) originating from Iran, Iraq, and Buchara; Balkan Jews; Yemenite Jews (YJ); and Jews of mixed origin. Clinical characteristics included hyposmia, urinary complaints, constipation, and rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder. Cognitive complaints, motor features, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and motor fluctuations were collected. Motor part of the MDS-UPDRS and Hoehn and Yahr scores were collected. RESULTS: The study comprised 174 PD Jewish patients (63.2% AJ, 56.4% males). The age at onset was 65.3 +- 10.2 years; 106 patients (60.9%) were genotyped (17 glucocerebrosidase [16.0%], 13 leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 [LRRK2] [12.3%]). Rates of hyposmia were significantly higher in AJ than NAJ (56.6% vs. 39.5%, respectively, P = 0.003). No significant differences were found in motor features in all variables. Of 13 AJ patients carrying the LRRK2 mutation, only one had hyposmia. Three patients with LRRK2 were NAJ. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia is less prevalent in PD patients of NAJ origin than in AJ. The rate of hyposmia in NAFJ patients is particularly low. The rate of other non-motor features is similar between NAJ and AJ patients.

37626243|t|Interactive effect of orthostatic hypotension on gray matter atrophy associated with hyposmia and RBD in de novo Parkinson's disease.
37626243|a|BACKGROUND: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a potential modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although other risk factors for dementia, hyposmia and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), are closely associated with autonomic dysfunction in PD, little is known about how these risk factors influence cognitive function and cerebral pathology. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how these three factors contribute to gray matter atrophy by considering the interaction of OH with hyposmia and RBD. METHODS: We analyzed cortical thickness, subcortical gray matter volume, and cognitive measures from 78 patients with de novo PD who underwent the head-up tilt test for the diagnosis of OH. RESULTS: Whole-brain analyses with Monte Carlo corrections revealed that hyposmia was associated with decreased cortical thickness in a marginal branch of the cingulate sulcus among patients with OH, and cortical thickness in this area correlated with cognitive functioning only in patients with OH. Subcortical gray matter volume analysis indicated that severe RBD was associated with decreased volume in the left hippocampus and bilateral amygdala among patients with OH. CONCLUSION: Even in early PD, OH exerts effects on gray matter atrophy and cognitive dysfunction by interacting with RBD and hyposmia. OH might exacerbate cerebral pathology induced by hyposmia or RBD.

37963486|t|A characteristic of olfactory function in four types of dementia and non-dementia subjects using smell identification test.
37963486|a|BACKGROUND: For those outpatients who were consulted for memory loss, the Japanese version of University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-J) was performed to examine olfactory function. In the same way, the revised version of Hasegawa Dementia Scale, Mini Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating and brain magnetic resonance imaging were used to investigate the cognitive function. In the present study, we evaluated the olfactory function of elderly subjects, including those with dementia, by means of UPSIT-J and we examined their characteristics. METHODS: The characteristics of dementia as Alzheimer type group (AD.G), mixed type group (MixD.G), vascular type group (VaD.G), dementia with Lewy bodies group (DLB.G) and the groups which had no dementia as low score group (LS.G), high score group (HS.G), and healthy group (H.G), were examined. RESULTS: The numbers of olfactory discriminating scores (nODS) were significantly lower in all the dementia groups than in all the LS.G, HS.G and the H.G. No significant difference was observed in nODS between AD.G and DLB.G. The rate of nODS with less than five scores were as follows: AD.G (80.1%), MixD.G (91.5%), VaD.G (63.1%), DLB.G (89.6%), LS.G (50.8%), HS.G (18.6%), H.G (15.6%). A significant positive correlation was found between nODS and Hasegawa Dementia Scale and Mini Mental State Examination scores (r = 0.567, r = 0.532, respectively), which was significant negatively correlated for Clinical Dementia Rating (r = -0.578). A significant negative correlation was observed between nODS and Z score of voxel-based specific regional analysis for Z score of Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) (r = 0.463). CONCLUSION: nODS showed a significant correlation between cognitive function tests and brain atrophy level. These results indicate that UPSIT-J is considered a psycho-physiological index useful for the diagnosis and early detection of dementia.

38193689|t|Reduced olfactory performance is associated with changed microbial diversity, oralization, and accumulation of dead biomaterial in the nasal olfactory area.
38193689|a|The partial or complete loss of the sense of smell, which affects about 20% of the population, impairs the quality of life in many ways. Dysosmia and anosmia are mainly caused by aging, trauma, infections, or even neurodegenerative disease. Recently, the olfactory area-a site containing the olfactory receptor cells responsible for odor perception-was shown to harbor a complex microbiome that reflects the state of olfactory function. This initially observed correlation between microbiome composition and olfactory performance needed to be confirmed using a larger study cohort and additional analyses. A total of 120 participants (middle-aged, no neurodegenerative disease) were enrolled in the study to further analyze the microbial role in human olfactory function. Olfactory performance was assessed using the Sniffin' Stick battery, and participants were grouped accordingly (normosmia: n = 93, dysosmia: n = 27). The olfactory microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and supplemented by metatranscriptomics in a subset (Nose 2.0). Propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was performed to distinguish between intact and non-intact microbiome components. The gastrointestinal microbiome of these participants was also characterized by amplicon sequencing and metabolomics and then correlated with food intake. Our results confirm that normosmics and dysosmics indeed possess a distinguishable olfactory microbiome. Alpha diversity (i.e., richness) was significantly increased in dysosmics, reflected by an increase in the number of specific taxa (e.g., Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, and Brachybacterium). Lower olfactory performance was associated with microbial signatures from the oral cavity and periodontitis (Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Selenomonas). However, PMA treatment revealed a higher accumulation of dead microbial material in dysosmic subjects. The gastrointestinal microbiome partially overlapped with the nasal microbiome but did not show substantial variation with respect to olfactory performance, although the diet of dysosmic individuals was shifted toward a higher meat intake. Dysosmia is associated with a higher burden of dead microbial material in the olfactory area, indicating an impaired clearance mechanism. As the microbial community of dysosmics (hyposmics and anosmics) appears to be influenced by the oral microbiome, further studies should investigate the microbial oral-nasal interplay in individuals with partial or complete olfactory loss.IMPORTANCEThe loss of the sense of smell is an incisive event that is becoming increasingly common in today's world due to infections such as COVID-19. Although this loss usually recovers a few weeks after infection, in some cases, it becomes permanent-why is yet to be answered. Since this condition often represents a psychological burden in the long term, there is a need for therapeutic approaches. However, treatment options are limited or even not existing. Understanding the role of the microbiome in the impairment of olfaction may enable the prediction of olfactory disorders and/or could serve as a possible target for therapeutic interventions.

38452143|t|Factors influencing olfactory function in an adult general population sample: the CHRIS study.
38452143|a|The sense of smell allows for the assessment of the chemical composition of volatiles in our environment. Different factors are associated with reduced olfactory function, including age, sex, as well as health and lifestyle conditions. However, most studies that aimed at identifying the variables that drive olfactory function in the population suffered from methodological weaknesses differences in study designs and participant selection, such as the inclusion of convenience sample or only of certain age groups, or recruitment biases. We aimed to overcome these issues by investigating the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) cohort, a population-based cohort, by using a validated odor identification test. Specifically, we hypothesized that a series of medical, demographic and lifestyle variables is associated with odor identification abilities. In addition, our goal was to provide clinicians and researchers with normative values for the Sniffin'Sticks identification set, after exclusion of individuals with impaired nasal patency. We included 6944 participants without acute nasal obstruction and assessed several biological, social, and medical parameters. A basic model determined that age, sex, years of education, and smoking status together explained roughly 13% of the total variance in the data. We further observed that variables related to medical (positive screening for cognitive impairment and for Parkinson's disease, history of skull fracture, stage 2 hypertension) and lifestyle (alcohol abstinence) conditions had a negative effect on odor identification scores. Finally, we provide clinicians with normative values for both versions of the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test, i.e., with 16 items and with 12 items.

38491209|t|Differential connectivity of the posterior piriform cortex in Parkinson's disease and postviral olfactory dysfunction: an fMRI study.
38491209|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common feature of both postviral upper respiratory tract infections (PV) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim was to investigate potential differences in the connectivity of the posterior piriform cortex, a major component of the olfactory cortex, between PV and PD patients. Fifteen healthy controls (median age 66 years, 9 men), 15 PV (median age 63 years, 7 men) and 14 PD patients (median age 70 years, 9 men) were examined with task-based olfactory fMRI, including two odors: peach and fish. fMRI data were analyzed with the co-activation pattern (CAP) toolbox, which allows a dynamic temporal assessment of posterior piriform cortex (PPC) connectivity. CAP analysis revealed 2 distinct brain networks interacting with the PPC. The first network included regions related to emotion recognition and attention, such as the anterior cingulate and the middle frontal gyri. The occurrences of this network were significantly fewer in PD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.023), with no significant differences among PV patients and the other groups. The second network revealed a dissociation between the olfactory cortex (piriform and entorhinal cortices), the anterior cingulate gyrus and the middle frontal gyri. This second network was significantly more active during the latter part of the stimulation, across all groups, possibly due to habituation. Our study shows how the PPC interacts with areas that regulate higher order processing and how this network is substantially affected in PD. Our findings also suggest that olfactory habituation is independent of disease.

38499888|t|Hyposmia correlates with axial signs and gait disorder in Parkinson's disease: an Italian Olfactory Identification Test study.
38499888|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a non-motor symptom and an important biomarker of Parkinson's disease (PD) because of its high prevalence (> 90%). Whether hyposmia correlates with motor symptoms is unclear. In the present study, we aim to investigate the relationship between olfactory impairment with both motor and non-motor features and disease variables (disease duration, stage, and severity). METHODS: One-hundred fifty-four PD patients were evaluated. Odor identification ability was tested using Italian Olfactory Identification Test (IOIT). A comprehensive spectrum of motor and non-motor features was assessed. Cognitive function was investigated through MMSE. Patients were divided into 3 different clinical phenotypes using UPDRS-III: tremor-dominant type (TDT), akinetic-rigid type (ART), and mixed type (MXT). RESULTS: Three of the 33 IOIT items were most frequently misidentified: basil (74.3%), coffee (66.9%), and mushroom (59.6%). Hyposmia was found in 93%. Hyposmic patients were older than controls (p = 0.01). Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) score of 2 or greater was associated with higher probability of being hyposmic (OR = 5.2, p = 0.01). IOIT score did not significantly differ between TDT, ART, and MXT of analyzed PD patients. Performance to IOIT inversely correlated with age (p < 0.01), disease duration (p = 0.01), and H&Y score of 2 or higher (p < 0.01). Clinical features that associated with higher IOIT score were freezing of gait (FOG) (p < 0.001) and camptocormia (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, IOIT scores showed a positive correlation with axial motor signs, but not with non-motor symptoms. IOIT may be a useful tool not only for supporting PD diagnosis but also for providing prognostic information about motor function.

38527709|t|Impaired olfactory identification in dementia-free individuals is associated with the functional abnormality of the precuneus.
38527709|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory dysfunction indicates a higher risk of developing dementia. However, the potential structural and functional changes are still largely unknown. METHODS: A total of 236 participants were enrolled, including 45 Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals and 191dementia-free individuals. Detailed study methods, comprising neuropsychological assessment and olfactory identification test (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test, UPSIT), as well as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were applied in this research. The dementia-free individuals were divided into two sub-groups based on olfactory score: dementia-free with olfactory dysfunction (DF-OD) sub-group and dementia-free without olfactory dysfunction (DF-NOD) sub-group. The results were analyzed for subsequent intergroup comparisons and correlations. The cognitive assessment was conducted again three years later. RESULTS: (i) At dementia-free stage, there was a positive correlation between olfactory score and cognitive function. (ii) In dementia-free group, the volume of crucial brain structures involved in olfactory recognition and processing (such as amygdala, entorhinal cortex and basal forebrain volumes) are positively associated with olfactory score. (iii) Compared to the DF-NOD group, the DF-OD group showed a significant reduction in olfactory network (ON) function. (iv) Compared to DF-NOD group, there were significant functional connectivity (FC) decline between PCun_L(R)_4_1 in the precuneus of posterior default mode network (pDMN) and the salience network (SN) in DF-OD group, and the FC values decreased with falling olfactory scores. Moreover, in DF-OD group, the noteworthy reduction in FC were observed between PCun_L(R)_4_1 and amygdala, which was a crucial component of ON. (v) The AD conversion rate of DF-OD was 29.41%, while the DF-NOD group was 12.50%. The structural and functional changes in the precuneus were also observed in AD and were more severe. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the olfactory circuit, the precuneus is a critical structure in the odor identification process, whose abnormal function underlies the olfactory identification impairment of dementia-free individuals.

38556445|t|Assessment of social behavior and chemosensory cue detection in an animal model of neurodegeneration.
38556445|a|Numerous studies have shown that aging in humans leads to a decline in olfactory function, resulting in deficits in acuity, detection threshold, discrimination, and olfactory-associated memories. Furthermore, impaired olfaction has been identified as a potential indicator for the onset of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies conducted on mouse models of AD have largely mirrored the findings in humans, thus providing a valuable system to investigate the cellular and circuit adaptations of the olfactory system during natural and pathological aging. However, the majority of previous research has focused on assessing the detection of neutral or synthetic odors, with little attention given to the impact of aging and neurodegeneration on the recognition of social cues-a critical feature for the survival of mammalian species. Therefore, in this study, we present a battery of olfactory tests that use conspecific urine samples to examine the changes in social odor recognition in a mouse model of neurodegeneration.

38708467|t|In health and illness: does taste remain consistent? Exploring the influence of inflammation on taste perception through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
38708467|a|OBJECTIVE: Dysgeusia is characterized by a loss of taste perception, leading to malnutrition. This situation affects inflammatory conditions such as respiratory and neurological conditions, obesity, cancer, chemotherapy, aging, and many others. To date, there is not much information on the prevalence and risk of dysgeusia in an inflammatory condition; also, it is unclear which flavor is altered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched three databases from January 2018 to January 2023. Participants were children, adults, or elderly persons with an inflammatory condition and evaluated taste loss. A random effects model was used for statistical analysis to calculate the pooled odds ratio with its corresponding 95.0% confidence interval to estimate the probability of taste alteration (dysgeusia) in an inflammatory condition. RESULTS: The data allowed us to conduct a systematic review, including 63 original articles and 15 studies to perform the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis indicated a heterogenicity of 84.7% with an odds ratio of 3.25 (2.66-3.96), indicating a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease, SARS-CoV-2, chemotherapy, and rhinosinusitis. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory conditions and taste alterations are linked. Dysgeusia is associated with a higher risk of malnutrition and poorer general health status, especially in vulnerable populations.

39127119|t|Cortical morphological alterations in cognitively normal Parkinson's disease with severe hyposmia.
39127119|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease(PD) and may hold valuable insights into the disease's underlying pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate cortical morphometry alterations in PD patients with severe hyposmia(PD-SH) and mild hyposmia(PD-MH) using surface-based morphometry(SBM) methods. Participants included 36 PD-SH patients, 38 PD-MH patients, and 40 healthy controls(HCs). SBM analysis revealed distinct patterns of cortical alterations in PD-SH and PD-MH patients. PD-MH patients exhibited reduced cortical thickness in the right supramarginal gyrus, while PD-SH patients showed widespread cortical thinning in regions including the bilateral pericalcarine cortex, bilateral lingual gyrus, left inferior parietal cortex, left lateral occipital cortex, right pars triangularis, right cuneus, and right superior parietal cortex. Moreover, PD-SH patients displayed reduced cortical thickness in the right precuneus compared to PD-MH patients. Fractal dimension analysis indicated increased cortical complexity in PD-MH patients' right superior temporal cortex and right supramarginal gyrus, as well as decreased complexity in the bilateral postcentral cortex, left superior parietal cortex, and right precentral cortex. Similarly, cortical gyrification index and cortical sulcal depth exhibited heterogeneous patterns of changes in PD-SH and PD-MH patients compared to HCs. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of olfactory impairment in PD, with distinct patterns of cortical morphometry alterations associated with different degrees of hyposmia. The observed discrepancies in brain regions showing alterations reflect the complexity of PD's pathophysiology. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of olfactory dysfunction in PD and provide potential avenues for early diagnosis and targeted interventions.

1744650|a|The ability to identify smells was tested in nine males and six females with motor neuron disease (MND) of varying severity, using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The olfactory impairment found in MND patients compared with age and sex matched controls is statistically significant at the 0.005 level. The relationship with Parkinson's disease, with Alzheimer's dementia and the possible aetiological implications of this new aspect of the MND are discussed.

1792139|t|Olfactory deficits in elderly subjects and Parkinson patients.
1792139|a|Two groups of subjects, 8 Parkinson patients and 16 normal elderly people, were examined on a matching and a naming olfactory task. On the former, subjects had to recognize among four a previously sniffed odour, while on the latter they had to label an odour by choosing among four alternatives proposed by the examiner. Analysis indicated different trends for the two groups, Parkinson patients being more efficient in naming than in matching, and the elderly people showing the opposite pattern. Data are discussed with reference to the loss of dopamine in Parkinson patients and the decline of memory processes in elderly people.

1894145|t|Olfactory dysfunction in three neurodegenerative diseases.
1894145|a|Olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and the parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) of Guam. We have recently demonstrated that the odor identification and detection deficits of patients with PD are equivalent to those of patients with mild AD when subtle differences in cognitive function are statistically controlled for by analysis of covariance. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and patients with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism evidence olfactory function much more similar to that of normal controls. In the present study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and the Picture Identification Test to 24 patients with early signs of the PDC of Guam and statistically compared their test scores to those of 24 early-stage AD and 24 early-stage PD patients of similar age and gender from the United States mainland. Although the PDC group evidenced slightly more difficulty in identifying pictures than did the other 2 groups, the odor identification deficit associated with this disorder was of the same magnitude as that observed in AD and PD, suggesting that olfactory testing cannot be used to distinguish among these 3 diseases and that the olfactory dysfunction of these disorders may reflect a common neurologic substrate.

1943420|t|The rhinologic evaluation of Alzheimer's disease.
1943420|a|Olfactory dysfunction is currently not listed among the NINCDS-ADRDA clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. There is a large amount of psychophysical and neuropathologic evidence to suggest that patients with Alzheimer's type dementia have olfactory system abnormalities. The rhinologic status of this group has not been characterized. The authors examined 21 Alzheimer's patients and 21 age-matched controls to determine whether 1. the Alzheimer's group, in fact, had a diminished sense of smell, and whether 2. rhinologic factors were responsible for this nasal dysfunction. The findings support a neurologically mediated phenomenon as the cause for significant impairment in olfactory function in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease.

2280803|t|Gustatory and olfactory dysfunction in dementia: not specific to Alzheimer's disease.
2280803|a|Significant losses in the ability to detect the taste of glutamic acid and to recognize odorants were found in demented patients when compared with age-matched controls. These losses were not specific to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but were also found in demented patients without AD. Detection thresholds for bitter-tasting quinine HCl were not higher in demented patients than in age-matched controls but were higher than thresholds in young subjects. These data suggest that losses in taste in demented patients may vary with the chemical structure of the tastant. The degree of loss in the ability to recognize odorants was greater in patients with a family history of senile dementia.

7851458|t|Ageusia associated with thalamic plaque in multiple sclerosis.
7851458|a|Ageusia and the cheirooral syndrome developed in a patient with a relapse of multiple sclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an area of demyelination in the thalamus. This lesion presumably affected the most medial part of the ventralis posterior nucleus, where taste information is located. Given the proximity of the taste area and somatosensory representation of the hand and oral cavity in the ventralis posterior nucleus, we propose that a diagnosis of thalamic lesion should be considered when ageusia occurs with the cheirooral syndrome.

8022246|t|The effect of human olfactory biopsy on olfaction: a preliminary report.
8022246|a|Normal human olfactory function is subject to a wide variety of factors. Although biopsy of human olfactory neuroepithelium has been reported by several researchers, there are no studies which have evaluated the effect of this procedure on olfactory function. In this retrospective study, we sought to determine if tissue removal from the olfactory cleft has an adverse influence on the sense of smell. Nineteen subjects underwent bilateral olfactory testing and subsequent endoscopic olfactory mucosal biopsy. All subjects were retested 6 weeks to 1 year after olfactory neuroepithelial biopsy. No statistical difference was found between olfactory tests performed before or after biopsy. These data suggest that biopsy of human olfactory neuroepithelium has no discernible adverse effect on the ability to smell.

9613755|t|Olfactory function in restless legs syndrome.
9613755|a|Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is usually idiopathic but may occur in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Both respond to dopaminergic medications. Whether these disorders share a common pathophysiology is unclear. Because PD is associated with a loss of olfactory function, we compared the olfactory function of patients with RLS with control and PD patients. Using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), olfactory function was found to be normal in patients with idiopathic RLS and significantly reduced in patients with PD. This suggests that the pathophysiology of RLS differs from PD, and that RLS likely is not a "forme fruste" or a preclinical sign of PD.

9929671|t|Abnormality of semantic network in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Evidence from verbal, perceptual, and olfactory domains.
9929671|a|A series of studies was initiated to model the organization of semantic memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using multidimensional scaling (MDS) and Pathfinder analyses. The resulting models (cognitive maps or semantic networks) embed studied stimuli in a coordinate space or network where distances between points are assumed to reflect psychological proximity between items. The organization of semantic networks in verbal and sensory domains were modeled based upon the frequency of the subject's choice of two concepts as most alike. Results suggested that while the organization of concepts in the semantic networks of AD patients was primarily based upon a concrete perceptual dimension in both verbal and olfactory domains, those of normal controls subjects were predominantly organized by an abstract conceptual attribute. Also, networks of AD patients were more complex and chaotic than normal, that is, they consisted of more unnecessary connections and of atypical strengths of association between concepts.

9929677|t|Very early changes in olfactory functioning due to Alzheimer's disease and the role of apolipoprotein E in olfaction.
9929677|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness marked by memory loss and at least one other cognitive disturbance. Early diagnosis of the disease has proved difficult and has therefore been the focus of much research. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein manufactured and distributed throughout the body, has shown specificity of binding to the beta A4 peptide, the primary component in the senile plaques of AD. Furthermore, the ApoE, epsilon 4 (epsilon 4) allele, is overrepresented in AD. These two lines of evidence suggest that ApoE, specifically the epsilon 4 allele, plays an important role in the development of AD. Further support for this hypothesis appears in neuropsychological data showing cognitive decrements in ostensibly nondemented individuals with the epsilon 4 allele, compared to those without the allele. It is also well known that olfaction is compromised in AD. Thus, the purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine very early changes in olfactory functioning due to AD and (2) to examine the role of ApoE in olfactory functioning in people at risk for AD by virtue of early cognitive decline. Results demonstrated changes in olfactory threshold the year immediately preceding change in diagnosis from normal control to AD. Also, in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, those with the ApoE epsilon 4 allele show poorer thresholds than those without the epsilon 4 allele.

10996914|t|[Olfactory testing with "sniffin' sticks" for clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease].
10996914|a|Olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS). In contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of IPS, clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed. This may be due to the lack of an easy-to-use, inexpensive, standardized, and reliable test. In this study, we administered the newly developed "sniffin' sticks" test to a group of 40 nondemented IPS patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking habits. In all three subtests including odor identification, odor detection threshold, and odor discrimination, the control group scored significantly better than the IPS group, yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90% each. Our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in IPS can be found at early stages of the disease, appear bilaterally, and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism. Therefore, we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of IPS.

11212134|t|Olfactory dysfunction and extent of white matter abnormalities in multiple sclerosis: a clinical and MR study.
11212134|a|BACKGROUND: The relative contribution to the olfactory dysfunction of the lesions in the specific brain regions involved in olfaction compared with the lesions scattered all over the rest of the brain has not been fully clarified yet in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The concurrent use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a standardized test of odor identification ability now permits to study the relation between smell loss and the extent of white matter abnormalities. METHODS: We tested the olfactory function of 40 patients with definite MS and of 40 age-sex- and smoking-habit-matched healthy controls by using the Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test. We measured also the lesion load on T2-weighted images in the inferior-frontal and temporal lobes and in the rest of the brain in MS patients. Therefore, we tried to correlate measures of lesion load and smell test scores. RESULTS: A robust correlation was demonstrated between MR measures of lesion load in the white matter of the olfactory brain region and smell loss (r=-0. 739, P<0.0001). A significant relationship has been found even after taking potential confounding factors, such as sex, age, disease duration, disability, anxiety and depression, into account (r=-0.90, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show, in MS patients with stable neurological impairment and no recent disease exacerbation, a correlation between smell loss and the lesion load in the regions of the brain involved in olfaction and support the theory that the extent and severity of MRI abnormalities in specific brain regions are related to the presence of selective neurologic and neuropsychologic impairment.

11369675|t|Rating of different olfactory judgements in Alzheimer's disease.
11369675|a|Using simple successive tasks we assessed the influence of Alzheimer's disease on the processing of different odours. Fifteen patients with Alzheimer's disease, 15 old control subjects and 15 young control subjects were tested. The experiment included two sessions. Initially 12 odorants were presented, one odorant every minute. For each odour the subjects were asked to rate intensity, pleasantness, familiarity and edibility using linear rating scales. The odorants were then presented a second time and the subjects were asked to identify them. The results show that the intensity scores were lower in old control subjects and Alzheimer patients than in the young control subjects and that familiarity and identification scores were lower in Alzheimer patients than in old control and young control subjects. When we compared the five olfactory tasks the impairment of performance in Alzheimer patients was relatively higher for identification than familiarity, itself higher than the intensity judgement. No difference was observed between the three groups of subjects for pleasantness and edibility judgements.

11376468|t|Olfactory identification is impaired in clinic-based patients with vascular dementia and senile dementia of Alzheimer type.
11376468|a|AIMS: It is now well established that there are abnormalities in the sense of smell in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). They have both raised olfactory thresholds and impaired odour identification. The situation in vascular dementia is unclear. We used the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a 40-item, forced choice, cued, 'scratch-and- sniff' test, to examine olfactory identification in vascular dementia and to determine whether it would differentiate the disorder from AD and normal elderly. METHODS: We investigated three matched subject groups: 13 people having a Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders in the Elderly (CAMDEX) diagnosis of definite senile dementia of Alzheimer type, 13 having a CAMDEX diagnosis of definite vascular dementia and 13 non-cognitively impaired controls. The subjects were then tested with the UPSIT in their own home by an independent blind researcher to see if the test could distinguish the different diagnostic groups in this setting. RESULTS: The median UPSIT score was 30 (out of a maximum of 40) for controls, 12 for the vascular group and 15 for the AD group. The difference was significant (p = 0.05) between both demented groups and the normal controls. Similarly there was a significant difference in the UPSIT score between the AD group and controls (p = 0.001) and between the vascular dementia group and controls (p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the AD group and the vascular dementia group. The UPSIT score correlated strongly with the degree of cognitive impairment as measured by the CAMCOG (r(s) = 0.683, p = 0.01) CONCLUSIONS: Patients with vascular dementia had a similar degree of olfactory impairment to those with AD. The UPSIT successfully differentiated between dementia patients and normal elderly British subjects tested in their own homes. The UPSIT did not differentiate between those with AD and vascular dementia.

12052777|t|Ratings of different olfactory judgements in schizophrenia.
12052777|a|We assessed the influence of schizophrenia on different olfactory tasks. Forty patients with schizophrenia (20 males and 20 females) and 40 control subjects (20 males and 20 females) were tested. The experiment included two sessions. Initially, 12 odorants were presented at a rate of one per minute. The subjects were asked to rate intensity, pleasantness, familiarity and edibility for each odour using linear rating scales. The odorants were then presented a second time and the subjects were asked to identify them. The results showed that the scores for pleasantness, familiarity, edibility and identification but not intensity were disturbed in patients when compared with control subjects. Furthermore, the familiarity judgement of male patients was more often deficient than that of female patients and they rated odorants as being inedible when the women judged them as neutral. Considered together, these data show that our olfactory test may be used in patients with schizophrenia for evidencing various dysfunctions specific to different types of olfactory processing that represent steps in the odour name identification process.

12111470|t|Olfactory function in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD): results from cross-sectional studies in IPD patients and long-term follow-up of de-novo IPD patients.
12111470|a|Olfactory loss is a prominent symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Experiment 1 re-investigated the diagnostic value of psychophysical testing in the differentiation between idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) from non-IPD; 50 consecutive PS patients participated. In Experiment 2 five de-novo patients received 3 olfactory tests spread over a period of approximately one year. Nineteen IPD patients were anosmic, and 18 were hyposmic. All but one patient with MSA and PSP had mild/moderate hyposmia. Normosmia was found in CBD/misdiagnosed PS/psychogenic movement disorder. In Experiment 2, one of the de-novo patients was normosmic, 3 hyposmic, and 1 anosmic. Follow up investigations indicated decreased olfactory function in 3 patients while it improved in one. The normosmic patient retained olfactory abilities. This patient failed to respond to pharmacological treatment. In summary, olfactory tests differentiate IPD from non-IPD. Furthermore, tests of olfactory function may also be of interest in investigations related to treatment of PS.

12214131|t|Assessing olfactory abilities with the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test: a Rasch scaling approach.
12214131|a|The strategy of delaying or retarding the progression of Alzheimer's disease requires early diagnosis and treatment. Previous research indicates that measurement of changes in olfaction and cognition will play an important role in the early detection of AD and in the monitoring of therapy effectiveness. Using the data of 177 subjects, our objective was to study the measurement properties of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) using a Rasch scaling framework. The results indicate that the UPSIT can yield a linear, unbiased, and unidimensional Rasch measure of human smell recognition abilities. As expected, olfactory recognition ability decreased with age, and at the rate of about 0.05 Logits per year. Also, Alzheimer's patients showed a decrease in smell recognition equivalent to that experienced by healthy subjects over the course of 30 years. Hormone replacement therapy was not found to affect healthy women's olfactory recognition ability. Additional diagnostic information can be extracted from the analysis of incorrect responses patterns that is relevant to group membership.

12231459|t|Olfactory identification and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele in mild cognitive impairment.
12231459|a|To investigate olfactory identification and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we used Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT) from University of Pennsylvania to assess olfactory identification performance and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (ApoE epsilon 4) allele in 28 patients with MCI and the 30 age-matched control subjects in present study. The Mann-Whitney U test demonstrated that the MCI group performed significantly worse on CC-SIT than the normal aging group (P<0.01). For MCI patients olfaction scores correlated positively with CAMCOG-C (r=0.61, P<0.01), but not with age, gender or years of education. In normal subjects, the CC-SIT score showed no significant associations with age, gender, years of education, or CAMCOG-C. As the least common allele in Chinese, epsilon 4 was found in 13.3% of controls and in 35.8% of MCI in this study. ApoE epsilon 4 was significantly higher in MCI group than normal group (chi(2)=4.65, P<0.01). There was a significant effect of allele status on odor identification: subjects with epsilon 4 allele were not able to identify as many odors as the subjects without epsilon 4 allele (P<0.01). These results suggested that the decreased olfactory identification in MCI may be a marker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and ApoE genotype may be part of the basis of olfactory identification decline.

12666770|t|Left hippocampal volume loss in Alzheimer's disease is reflected in performance on odor identification: a structural MRI study.
12666770|a|The very high sensitivity and specificity of odor identification tasks in discriminating between Alzheimer's patients and normals suggests that they reflect the presence of underlying neuropathology. Significant neuropathological changes are seen in areas critical to processing olfactory information, even in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study was designed to investigate whether performance on olfactory tasks (odor threshold and odor identification) was related to volumetric MRI measures of mesial temporal areas central to olfactory information processing and important in the neuropathology of AD. Participants were 8 male and 5 female patients with probable AD, and 10 male and 12 female normal age-matched controls, diagnosed at the UCSD Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The study investigated correlations between volumetric measures of hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala, and the psychophysical measures of olfactory function. Robust relationships were observed between mesial temporal lobe volumes and olfactory functional measures. The finding of a strong relationship between left hippocampal volume and performance on the odor identification task (r = .85) is compatible with a left-hemisphere superiority for verbally mediated olfactory tasks. The findings suggest a neural substrate for the breakdown in functional performance on verbally mediated odor identification tasks in Alzheimer's disease and suggest the utility of quantitative MRI measures and psychophysical performance in the assessment of AD. These results support the potential clinical utility of inclusion of odor identification tests in diagnostic batteries for detecting AD.

12703044|t|[Gustatory disorders during multiple sclerosis relapse].
12703044|a|Gustatory dysfunction is a known but uncommon element in the course of multiple sclerosis. Gustatory dysfunction has been described during the chronic progressive phase and during the relapse phase. We report five patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis who developed transient gustatory disorders during the relapse phase of their disease. Agueusia occurred as one of the first symptoms in three patients, revealing the disease. Symptoms generally improved with remission or corticosteroid administration. These disorders are due to demyelinating lesions of the gustatory pathways in the thalamus or brainstem. MRI studies were not performed during the relapse phase and no clinical neuroimaging correlations could be established. Agueusia may be accompanied by olfactory dysfunction which is due to plaque demyelinization of the olfactory pathways, particularly in the temporal and inferior frontal lobes. Taste anomalies can also be observed in other diseases, including systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis or Sjogren's syndrome. Drug-induced gustatory disorders are also reported.

12799595|t|Odor identification deficits in diffuse lewy body disease.
12799595|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe odor identification performance in patients with diffuse Lewy body disease and determine the clinical utility of odor identification tests in distinguishing diffuse Lewy body disease from Alzheimer disease. BACKGROUND: The presence of olfactory deficits, especially odor identification deficits, has been well established in both Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. The presence of olfactory deficits in diffuse Lewy body disease is also likely given the overlap of clinical symptoms and neuropathology with Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. However, odor identification abilities have not been described previously in diffuse Lewy body disease. METHODS: Nine patients from a clinic sample with diffuse Lewy body disease and nine carefully matched patients with Alzheimer disease were administered an odor identification task as part of their neuropsychologic evaluations. RESULTS: Patients with diffuse Lewy body disease performed significantly worse than patients with Alzheimer disease on the odor identification test. CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification deficits may be more prevalent and severe in people with diffuse Lewy body disease than in people with Alzheimer disease, and olfactory testing may be useful in antemortem differential diagnosis of the two disorders.

12907591|t|Evidence for deficiencies in perceptual and semantic olfactory processes in Parkinson's disease.
12907591|a|Olfactory deficits have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) and are thought to represent a sensitive marker of the disease. The aim of the present study was to examine the differential contribution in olfactory dysfunction of perceptual and semantic processes of odours in PD patients. Twenty-four PD patients (12 males and 12 females) and 24 control subjects (12 males and 12 females) were tested. The experiment included two sessions. Initially, 12 odorants were delivered, one per minute. For each odour, subjects were asked to rate intensity, pleasantness, familiarity and edibility using linear rating scales. The odorants were again presented and the subjects were asked to identify them. The four olfactory judgements and odour identification were severely disturbed in PD patients when compared to control subjects. These findings demonstrate major deficits for all cognitive tasks of olfactory judgement in PD, and suggest that PD is associated with disruption of olfactory areas situated in the temporal lobes and also in the prefrontal cortex.

A key role is played by a pathologically folded protein, the distribution of which in the brain permits new conclusions about the stage of the disease. Gene mutations in affected families provide further clues as to the pathological process. In addition to symptom control, future treatment strategies will be aimed in particular at slowing down the underlying pathological process, and will therefore go in the direction of neuroprotection and neurorestoration. Dopamine agonists that can slow cell degeneration are already the first-line treatment in patients under 70 years of age.

15711853|t|Olfactory bulb volumes in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease a pilot study.
15711853|a|Olfactory loss is among early signs of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The present pilot study aimed to investigate whether this loss would be reflected in a decreased volume of the olfactory bulb (OB) established through magnetic resonance imaging. Eleven consecutive IPD patients were compared to 9 healthy, age-matched controls. Results indicated that there is little or no difference between IPD patients and healthy controls in terms of OB volume. Based upon the relation between loss of olfactory input to the olfactory bulb and consecutive decrease in volume, these data support the idea that olfactory loss in IPD is not a primary consequence of damage to the olfactory epithelium but rather results from central-nervous changes.

15719425|t|Smell identification ability in twin pairs discordant for Parkinson's disease.
15719425|a|Olfactory dysfunction has been proposed to be a sign that may precede the motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). To determine whether smell identification deficits predict subsequent PD, we studied smell identification ability using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 62 members of male twin pairs discordant for PD at baseline. Smell identification ability was reduced at baseline in the twins with PD compared to their unaffected brothers (23 vs. 31 of 40; P = 0.001). UPSIT scores were not reduced in the twins without PD when compared to age- and gender-specific normal values. After a mean interval of 7.3 years, 28 unaffected twins were still alive and 19 agreed to a second evaluation. Two had newly developed PD. Neither twin had impaired smell identification at baseline. The average decline in UPSIT percentile scores in these 2 twins was greater than in the 17 twins who did not develop PD (-68% vs. -24%; P = 0.01). In subjects who did not meet Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations diagnostic criteria for PD at baseline, the presence of cardinal signs of parkinsonism was not associated with lower baseline UPSIT scores nor with a subsequent decline. Smell identification ability may not be a sensitive indicator of future PD 7 or more years before the development of motor signs, even in a theoretically at-risk population.

15919549|t|Apolipoprotein epsilon4 is associated with more rapid decline in odor identification than in odor threshold or Dementia Rating Scale scores.
15919549|a|Individuals with the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) show deficits in olfactory function. The purpose of the present study was to examine longitudinally odor identification (odor ID), odor threshold, picture identification, and global cognitive status in allele positive (epsilon4+) and negative (epsilon4-) persons. Participants were initially given the San Diego Odor Identification test, an odor threshold test, and the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS). Participants were re-tested approximately four years later. The results indicate: (1) odor ID declined more rapidly in epsilon4+ than in epsilon4- normal elderly adults; (2) neither group exhibited a significant decline in odor threshold, picture identification or DRS scores. These results suggest that declines in odor identification occur before declines in other measures of dementia in persons at risk for AD because of their APOE allele genetic status.

16086128|t|Olfactory screening test in mild cognitive impairment.
16086128|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transient status between physiologic ageing and dementia. Each year more than 12% of subjects with MCI develop Alzheimer's disease. This study evaluated the presence of an olfactory deficit in amnesic MCI (aMCI) patients. Twenty-nine patients diagnosed with aMCI and a homogeneous control group of 29 subjects were enrolled in the study. Olfactory function was assessed by the Sniffin' Sticks Screening Test (SSST) and the Mini Mental State Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating, the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Mental Deterioration Battery were used to evaluate the neurocognitive status. aMCI patients showed a significant impairment of their olfactory identification compared to controls (SSST score: 8.3+/-2.1 vs. 10.8+/-0.9; p<0.001). These results suggest that olfactory tests should be part of the diagnostic armamentarium of pre-clinical dementia. A long-term follow up might confirm the olfactory identification function as an early and reliable marker in the diagnosis of pre-clinical dementia.

16445161|t|Olfactory function in people with genetic risk of dementia.
16445161|a|BACKGROUND: Screening for sensorial impairment is a secondary objective in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, including dementias. For example, olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease. There has been no study of olfactory function in Irish subjects at risk of dementia. AIM: To investigate olfactory function in non-demented Irish persons, who carry genetic risk factors for dementia. METHODS: Thirty-eight Irish adult subjects, who are at risk of dementia, were recruited. Cognitive performance and olfactory function were assessed and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype determined. RESULTS: Three and six subjects had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) score, respectively, outside the normal range. While five out of the fifteen epsilon-4 allele positive subjects had B-SIT scores outside the normal range, only one out of the twenty-three epsilon-4 allele negative subjects had; the difference in this frequency was significant (P=0.025). There was no significant difference (P=0.266) in the frequency of abnormal MMSE scores between epsilon-4 allele groups. CONCLUSION: Further investigation is required to explore the reasons for the higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in epsilon-4 allele positive subjects.

17299804|t|Use of the Brief Smell Identification Test for olfactory deficit in a Norwegian population with Alzheimer's disease.
17299804|a|AIMS: Several studies have shown that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with hyposmia. Olfactory identification may be a cheap and simple additional test in the assessment of early cognitive changes. The sense of smell is influenced by factors such as experience and culture and the aim of the present study was to assess the validity of the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) in distinguishing patients with AD from healthy gender and age-matched controls in a Norwegian population. METHODS: The study included 39 patients with a diagnosis of probable AD, and 52 gender and age-matched controls. Olfactory function was assessed with B-SIT, and a non-standardized olfactory identification task (freshly ground coffee). RESULTS: The difference in olfactory performance between patients and controls was highly significant, both for the whole AD patient group and the subgroup of patients with MMSE >or= 24. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses indicated that B-SIT distinguished patients from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. All the odours in B-SIT with the exception of turpentine showed highly significant differences between patients and controls. AD-associated memory impairment did not seem to affect the answers given for B-SIT in this population. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with AD, the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) appears to be well-suited for detecting a deficit in olfactory identification in a Norwegian population.

17357143|a|Recent studies support the idea of olfactory dysfunction as a very early sign of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Aim of the present study was to clinically follow-up patients with idiopathic hyposmia to find out the percentage of patients developing IPD after 4 years time. At baseline, olfactory tests had been combined with transcranial sonography of the substantia nigra and (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging. At the present neurological examination, 7% of the individuals with idiopathic hyposmia had developed clinical IPD. Altogether, 13% presented with abnormalities of the motor system. Our data suggest that a combination of olfactory testing and other tests may constitute a screening tool for the risk to develop IPD.

17553102|t|Alpha-synuclein pathology in the olfactory pathways of dementia patients.
17553102|a|Lewy-type pathology is a characteristic of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Thus far, the definitive diagnosis of these dementias can only be confirmed at post-mortem. However, it is known that the loss of smell (anosmia) is an early symptom in patients who develop dementia, and the use of the smell test has been proposed as an early diagnostic procedure. The aim of this study was to understand further the extent of Lewy pathology in the olfactory system of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Post-mortem tissue from 250 subjects was obtained from the OPTIMA brain bank. Five areas of the olfactory pathway were examined by immunolabelling for alpha-synuclein - a major component of Lewy pathology: the olfactory tract/bulb (n = 79), the anterior olfactory nucleus in the lateral olfactory gyrus (n = 193), the region of olfactory projection to the orbito-frontal cortex (n = 225), the hippocampus (n = 236) and the amygdala (n = 201). Results show that Lewy pathology affects different parts of the olfactory pathways differentially, suggesting a specific pattern of development of pathology. Clinical Parkinson's disease is most likely to be identified if the orbito-frontal cortex is affected, while the diagnosis is less likely if the pathology is restricted to the olfactory bulb or tract. These results suggest that pathology in the olfactory bulb and tract occurs prior to clinical signs of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the results presented here provide further evidence supporting the possible value of a smell test to aid the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

17761724|t|Different odor tests contribute differently to the evaluation of olfactory loss.
17761724|a|In a clinical context, the importance of the sense of smell has increasingly been recognized, for example, in terms of the evaluation of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, 2 strategies of olfactory testing, a simple one and a more complex one, were compared with respect to their suitability to assess olfactory dysfunction. Odor threshold (T), discrimination (D), and identification (I) were assessed in a control sample of 916 males and 1160 females, aged 6-90 years, and in 81 men and 21 women, aged 38-80 years, suffering from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Sums of the 3 subtest results T, D, and I yielded threshold discrimination identification (TDI) scores reflecting olfactory function. Sensitivity of any of the 3 subtests to confirm the diagnosis established by the composite TDI score was assessed separately for each test. Principal component analyses were applied to determine any common source of variance among the 3 specific subtests. Sensitivities of the subtests to provide the diagnosis established by the composite TDI score were 64% (T), 56% (D), and 47% (I), respectively. In IPD patients, each of the subtests provided the correct diagnosis (sensitivity >90%), as olfaction was impaired in 99% of the patient group. Two principal components emerged in both controls and IPD patients, with eigenvalues >0.5. The first component received high loadings from all factors. The second component received high loadings from odor threshold, whereas loadings from odor discrimination and identification were much smaller. In conclusion, combined testing of several components of olfaction, especially including assessment of thresholds, provides the most significant approach to the diagnosis of smell loss.

17879615|t|[Hypogeusia in a 9-year-old girl with multiple sclerosis].
17879615|a|We reported a case of hypogeusia in a 9-year-old girl with multiple sclerosis (MS). She had two episodes of neurological disturbances resembling those associated with MS, and diagnosed by McDonald's criteria. She complained of gustatory disturbance on the first attack. A quantitative test with four fundamental tastes (measurements with a filter paper disc) suggested decreased gustatory sensitivity in the right anterior part of the tongue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right thalamic lesion involving the ventral posteromedial nucleus parvocellular part (VPMpc). The patient was successfully treated with steroid pulse therapy, and improvement of neurological abnormalities involving gustatory disturbances was seen. Some studies of monkeys have demonstrated that the secondary neurons in the gustatory part of the solitary nucleus project ipsilaterally to VPMpc in the brainstem. The gustatory pathway in humans has not yet been demonstrated, but is speculated to be present based on that of monkeys. In the present case, we considered that the thalamic lesion involving VPMpc caused a decreased sense of taste in the ipsilateral part of the tongue. Several neurological abnormalities caused by multifocal demyelinating lesions can be observed in MS, but gustatory disturbance is rare. We quantitatively investigated unilateral gustatory disturbance in our patient, and concluded that the ipsilateral thalamic lesion detected by MRI could be causative.

17911364|t|Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genotype and gender: effects on memory.
17911364|a|OBJECTIVE: Episodic recognition memory for odors and visual was assessed in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4-positive and epsilon4-negative men and women diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD) and a healthy age- and gender-matched comparison group. METHODS: A total of 38 AD patients and 38 age- and gender-matched healthy older adults completed a recognition memory task involving three categories of stimuli: odors, faces, and symbols. RESULTS: In the healthy comparison group, men who were epsilon4 negative outperformed epsilon4-positive men in recognition memory for odors and committed fewer false-positive errors. However, there were no significant differences between epsilon4-negative and epsilon4-positive women in the comparison group. No significant gender or ApoE status differences were detected in recognition memory for faces or symbols in the comparison group. In patients with AD, epsilon4-negative women outperformed epsilon4-positive women in recognition memory for odors and committed significantly fewer false-positive errors. However, there were no significant differences between epsilon4-positive and epsilon4-negative men. There were no significant gender or ApoE status differences in recognition memory for faces or symbols in AD patients. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that recognition memory for olfactory stimuli may be particularly impaired in healthy older men with the epsilon4 allele. In patients with AD, odor memory impairments may be less severe in women who are negative for the epsilon4 allele. The results offer new insight into how recognition memory is affected by gender, the epsilon4 allele, and the modality of the stimulus to be remembered in healthy older adults and patients with AD.

18435767|t|Diagnostic performance of clinical motor and non-motor tests of Parkinson disease: a matched case-control study.
18435767|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) is made typically on the basis of motor abnormalities. PD is now recognized to have both motor and non-motor manifestations, indicating a need for the development of reliable non-motor diagnostic tests for PD. The aim of the present study was to compare the accuracy of various clinical motor and non-motor tests for the diagnosis of PD. METHODS: Forty-five PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3; mean age 59.5 +/- 10.0 years) and 45 healthy controls matched for gender and age completed a clinimetric motor test battery to assess limb bradykinesia, tremor and balance. Non-motor tests consisted of depression, anxiety and smell identification ratings. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used. RESULTS: We found that smell identification was the most accurate predictor of the presence of PD within the overall group of patients and matched control subjects (AUC = 0.886) and also in the subgroups of mild severity (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-1.5; AUC = 0.923), young-onset (AUC = 0.888) and female PD patients (AUC = 0.797). The second best diagnostic test was the grooved pegboard test for the clinically most affected body side. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that olfactory function is the most accurate diagnostic predictor within a heterogeneous sample of patients with PD.

18619712|t|Odor identification impairment in carriers of ApoE-varepsilon4 is independent of clinical dementia.
18619712|a|The ApoE gene is expressed in olfactory brain structures and is believed to play a role in neuronal regenerative processes as well as in development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. The varepsilon4 allele has been reported to be associated with compromised odor identification ability in the elderly, and this deficit has been interpreted as a sign of pre-diagnostic AD. However, because it has not been demonstrated that the relationship between the varepsilon4 allele and odor identification is mediated by dementia, it is possible that the varepsilon4 allele may have an effect on odor identification over and above any effects of dementia. The present study investigated effects of ApoE-status on odor identification in a large, population-based sample (n=1236) of adults (45-80 years), who were assessed for dementia at time of testing and 5 years later. The results showed that the varepsilon4 allele was associated with an odor identification deficit among elderly participants (75-80). Critically, this effect remained after current and pre-diagnostic dementia, vocabulary, global cognitive status and health variables were partialled out. The present results suggest that the ApoE gene plays a role in olfactory functioning that is independent of dementia conversion within 5 years.

18620351|t|The effect of hormone therapy on olfactory sensitivity is dependent on apolipoprotein E genotype.
18620351|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show a deficit in olfactory threshold sensitivity. The Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele is associated with increased risk of AD and earlier symptom onset. Hormone therapy (HT) may exert neuroprotective effects on brain areas affected by AD. The current study investigated the effect of HT on performance on an olfactory threshold test in epsilon4 positive and epsilon4 negative non-hysterectomized, non-demented, elderly females and AD patients. Among the non-demented participants, epsilon4 positive females who had received HT performed 1) significantly better than those without HT, and 2) at levels similar to those of epsilon4 negative females. In contrast, those without HT who were epsilon4 positive performed significantly worse than those who were epsilon4 negative. HT had no effect on performance in AD patients regardless of epsilon4 status. These results suggest that HT may offer protection against loss of olfactory function in epsilon4 positive individuals in preclinical stages of AD. Future research is warranted in order to investigate further the neuroprotective role of HT on sensory and cognitive functions in non-demented aging individuals.

18662205|t|Olfaction and the 5-year incidence of cognitive impairment in an epidemiological study of older adults.
18662205|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether odor identification ability is associated with the 5-year incidence of cognitive impairment in a large population of older adults with normal cognition at baseline and whether olfactory impairment contributes to the prediction of cognitive decline. DESIGN: Population-based longitudinal study. SETTING: Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand nine hundred twenty participants in the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (mean age 66.9). MEASUREMENTS: Olfaction was measured using the San Diego Odor Identification Test (SDOIT). Incident cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of less than 24 or reported diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) at follow-up in participants with a MMSE score of 24 or greater and no diagnosis of dementia or AD at baseline. RESULTS: There was a significant association between olfactory impairment at baseline and 5-year incidence of cognitive impairment (odds ratio (OR)=6.62, 95% confidence interval (CI)=4.36-10.05). The association remained significant after adjusting for possible confounders (OR=3.72, 95% CI=2.31-5.99). The positive predictive value of the SDOIT was 15.9%, the negative predictive value was 97.2%, the sensitivity was 55.1%, and the specificity was 84.4% for 5-year incidence of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Olfactory impairment at baseline was strongly associated with 5-year incidence of cognitive impairment as measured using the MMSE. Odor identification testing may be useful in high-risk settings, but not in the general population, to identify patients at risk for cognitive decline.

19172623|t|Advanced time-series analysis of MEG data as a method to explore olfactory function in healthy controls and Parkinson's disease patients.
19172623|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether time-series analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is a suitable method to study brain activity related to olfactory information processing, and to detect differences in odor-induced brain activity between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls. METHODS: Whole head 151-channel MEG recordings were obtained in 21 controls and 20 patients with PD during a 10-min olfactory stimulus paradigm, consisting of 10 alternating rest-stimulus cycles (30 s each), using phenylethyl alcohol administered by means of a Burghart olfactometer. Relative spectral power and synchronization likelihood (SL; an unbiased measure of functional connectivity) were calculated for delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta, and gamma frequency bands. RESULTS: In controls, olfactory stimulation produced an increase in theta power and a decrease in beta power. In patients with PD, there was a decrease in alpha1 power. No significant interaction between group and condition was found for spectral power. SL analysis revealed a significantly different response to olfactory stimulation in patients with PD compared to controls. In controls, the odor stimulus induced a decrease in local beta band SL. The response in patients with PD involved a decrease in intrahemispheric alpha2 band SL. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that time-series analysis of MEG data, including spectral power and SL, can be used to detect odor-induced changes in brain activity. In addition, differences in odor-induced brain activity were found between patients with PD and controls using analysis of SL, but not of spectral power.

19329351|t|Performance on an Alzheimer-selective odor identification test in patients with Parkinson's disease and its relationship with cerebral dopamine transporter activity.
19329351|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown selective deficits of odor identification in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brief, selective AD smell screening tests have been developed to identify subjects at risk of AD. The disease specificity of such screening tests has not been formally evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of an Alzheimer-selective odor identification test in patients with PD and its relationship with cerebral dopamine transporter (DAT) activity. METHODS: PD patients (n=44; Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III; 13f/31m; mean age 59.3+/-10.1) and 44 controls matched for gender and age completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). All patients had PD duration > 1 year and none had evidence of dementia. Using the UPSIT, we calculated performance on the 10 odors previously reported to be selective for AD risk (UPSIT-AD10). A subset of 29 PD patients also underwent brain DAT [(11)C]beta-CFT (2-beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane) PET imaging. DAT binding was assessed in the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral and dorsal striatum. RESULTS: UPSIT-AD10 scores were significantly lower in the patient (5.8+/-2.1) compared to the control group (8.6+/-2.4) (t=5.8, P<0.0001). However, UPSIT-AD10 performance in the PD patients did not correlate with striatal or mesolimbic DAT activity. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia in PD and AD overlap and supposed Alzheimer-selective smell screening tests may not be specific for AD. However, the supposed AD-selective hyposmia scores in PD did not correlate with cerebral DAT binding and may reflect a non-dopaminergic olfactory mechanism.

19340393|t|Odor recognition memory is not independently impaired in Parkinson's disease.
19340393|a|The results of previous studies in small groups of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are inconclusive with regard to the presence of an odor recognition memory impairment in PD. The aim of the present study was to investigate odor recognition memory in PD in a larger group of patients. Odor recognition memory and detection thresholds were assessed using components of the "Sniffin' Sticks" test battery in 55 non-demented PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III) and 50 control subjects of comparable age and sex. PD patients performed slightly but significantly worse than control subjects on the odor recognition memory task. After correction for odor detection scores, however, the difference in odor recognition memory performance between PD patients and controls was no longer statistically significant. These data indicate that odor recognition memory is not independently impaired in PD patients.

19448090|t|Olfactory impairment is more marked in patients with mild dementia with Lewy bodies than those with mild Alzheimer disease.
19448090|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia patients with anosmia are more likely to have Lewy body pathology at postmortem, but clinicopathological studies have only assessed olfaction in moderate dementia or an average of 5 years before death. It is not known whether, in patients with mild dementia (MMSE score over 20), olfactory function is more impaired in Alzheimer disease (AD) than dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: Patients with mild DLB (n = 21), mild AD (n = 27), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 21) and controls (n = 47) were assessed using a 16-item olfactory identification test and an olfactory threshold test which used sticks impregnated with differing concentrations of butanol. RESULTS: Patients with mild DLB had impaired olfactory identification ability compared with those with mild AD or MCI, independent of age, cognitive function and sex. The sensitivity of a cutoff score of seven correct responses out of 16 was 0.81 for distinguishing mild DLB from mild AD (AUC 0.682). The specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the same cut-off score were 0.41, 0.48 and 0.73, respectively. The olfactory threshold was not different in the AD and DLB groups. CONCLUSIONS: Simple bedside tests of olfactory identification merit further examination for their potential to improve the identification of patients with DLB when used alongside existing criteria. They are insufficiently specific for use in screening.

19526836|t|[Relationship between the regional cerebral blood flow and the cognitive function and anosmia in patients with Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease].
19526836|a|We compared the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the olfactory area and the cognitive function and anosmia in patient with Parkinson disease (PD) and in those with Alzheimer disease (AD). UPDRS III, MMSE, HDS-R, CDR, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were employed in this study. The subjects included 56 PD patients (average age 71.4+/-9.69 years), 23 AD patients (average age 73.3+/-7.12 years), 12 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (average age 72.5+/-6.89 years), and 9 age-matched controls (NC) (average age 73.8+/-6.61 years). Next we intravenously injected 1 ampule of thiamine propyldisulphide (Alinamin) and confirmed anosmia. In addition, we performed 123I-IMP SPECT (SEE methods) and satistically determined rCBF of the olfactory area based on the basis of the Z scores of the interest area. Anosima was detected in approximately 40% of the PD and AD patients. The HDS-R and MMSE scores were significantly higher in patients with anosima than in those without anosima; the CDR scores were significantly higher in the former than in the latter. Further, the incidence of anosima in PD patients and AD patients with MCI increased with an increase in the CDR scores. In order to determine the rCBF of the olfactory area of the PD and AD patients. As to rCBF of the olfactory area, we examined left and right Z scores of hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala, and uncus at Talairach level 3 and the scores of the Brodmann area 28, 34, 35, and 36 at Talairach level 5. In patients with anosmia, the Z scores were significantly high in cases with anosmia in all areas except the right Brodmann area 34 in PD patients and the right Brodmann area 28 and bilateral the Brodmann area 34 of both sides in AD patients. Some parts of the olfactory area are closely related to cognitive function, and it appeares that a reduced rCBF in the olfactory areas may lead to a functional decline in these regions which may cause anosmia and cognitive decline in PD and AD patients.

19720385|t|Functional imaging studies of hyposmia in Parkinson's disease.
19720385|a|Hyposmia in Parkinson's disease (PD) was evaluated by using neuroimaging techniques. It is well known that olfactory impairments are one of the cardinal non-motor symptoms in PD. However, all smell tests used in previous studies depend on subjective answers by examinees and on sniffing of odorants, the latter of which may be impaired in PD as a consequence of motor impairments. We developed an fMRI system, which can visualize brain activation by olfactory stimuli during natural breathing. Although 7 age-matched controls demonstrated significant activations in various brain areas including precentral gyrus (BA6/6) and middle temporal gyrus (BA19/39) by the odorant stimuli, 9 patients with PD showed little activations by the same stimuli. These data suggest that the olfactory dysfunction in PD is not a simple reflection of impaired sniffing. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate that the olfactory impairments may precede the onset of motor symptoms. Moreover, several pathological studies suggest that amygdala is one of the most frequently affected regions and is closely related to hyposmia in PD. Further brain imaging studies of hyposmia will shed light on the early pathological changes in PD.

20175211|t|Incidental Lewy body disease: clinical comparison to a control cohort.
20175211|a|Limited clinical information has been published on cases pathologically diagnosed with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD). Standardized, longitudinal movement and cognitive data was collected on a cohort of subjects enrolled in the Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program. Of 277 autopsied subjects who had antemortem clinical evaluations within the previous 3 years, 76 did not have Parkinson's disease, a related disorder, or dementia of which 15 (20%) had ILBD. Minor extrapyramidal signs were common in subjects with and without ILBD. Cognitive testing revealed an abnormality in the ILBD group in the Trails B test only. ILBD cases had olfactory dysfunction; however, sample size was very small. This preliminary report revealed ILBD cases have movement and cognitive findings that for the most part were not out of proportion to similarly assessed and age-similar cases without Lewy bodies. Larger sample size is needed to have the power to better assess group differences.

AIM: To review the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of the different NMS of PD based on recent studies. DEVELOPMENT: In most of the NMS the pathophysiological foundation is complex. In addition to the dopaminergic dysfunction, the degeneration of non-dopaminergic (i.e. noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic) cellular systems is thought to underlie the development of most of the NMS and can be applied in dementia, depression, sleep disorders and vegetative disorders. Dementia, moreover, is essentially caused by different alterations that take place with the cerebral cortex. Dysfunction of the ventral striatum and of the mesolimbic projections exerts a crucial influence in impulsive-compulsive spectrum disorder. Loss of the sense of smell appears to be due to the neuronal degeneration of the olfactory bulb and the pain has an extremely varied pathogenetic basis and may be musculoskeletal, dystonic, radicular or central. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that a huge amount of progress has been made in research on the pathophysiology of the NMS of PD, further clinicopathological and pathobiochemical comparative studies are needed to explain the pathophysiological bases of PD and to provide a broader foundation for future therapeutic strategies to treat NMS.

20378403|t|Olfactory dysfunction in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.
20378403|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is frequently observed in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) such as Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. METHODS: Olfactory function tests using Sniffin' Sticks and Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) were performed in 73 consecutive middle-aged (range, 50-69 years) patients with iRBD, 33 consecutive older-aged (71-82 years) patients with iRBD, and 28 control subjects (55-70 years). RESULTS: Odor identification was more frequently impaired than odor threshold or discrimination among the iRBD group and allowed better discrimination between the middle-aged iRBD group and age-adjusted control subjects. The area under the curve for threshold, discrimination, identification, TDI score and OSIT-J score determined from receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.831 (0.753-0.909), 0.761 (0.666-0.855), 0.938 (0.894-0.982), 0.939 (0.897-0.981), and 0.965 (0.931-0.999), respectively. Discrimination and identification scores were significantly lower in the older-aged iRBD group than in the middle-aged iRBD group. A significant correlation was observed between the identification score on Sniffin' Sticks and OSIT-J score (r=0.5910, P<0.0001, n=106, Spearman's rank). CONCLUSION: Anosmia/hyposmia may be a feature of iRBD. Olfactory dysfunction in iRBD is a consistent, widespread central nervous abnormality of different olfactory modalities with different cognitive complexity.

20714205|t|Idiopathic phantosmia: outcome and clinical significance.
20714205|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Little is known about the clinical significance of phantosmia. The literature on phantosmia indicates that this symptom has a wide range of differential diagnoses. However, most cases of phantosmia remain of unknown origin. Our goal was to follow up patients with idiopathic phantosmia, with special regard to improvement rates and possible severe health conditions preceded by phantosmia of unknown origin. METHODS: Forty-four patients with idiopathic phantosmia which had consulted our Ear-Nose-Throat Smell and Taste Clinic over the last 10 years were contacted by telephone and underwent a structured medical interview. RESULTS: None of the patients had developed any severe health condition or Parkinson's disease. More than 5 years after the occurrence of phantosmia, more than 50% of the patients experienced disappearance (31.8%) or improvement (25%). In the remaining cases, phantosmia did not change (38.7%) or became worse (<5%). CONCLUSION: The main findings of the present study were that idiopathic phantosmia improves or disappears in almost two thirds of the patients after more than 5 years, and that idiopathic phantosmia seems to be more likely a harmless symptom rather than a reliable predictor of early Parkinson's disease or other severe diseases.

20736182|t|A basic smell test is as sensitive as a dopamine transporter scan: comparison of olfaction, taste and DaTSCAN in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
20736182|a|AIM: To evaluate relationship between odour identification, taste threshold, dopamine transporter scan (DaTSCAN) and motor function in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and their diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with early parkinsonism were evaluated by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), DaTSCAN, electrogustometry (EGM) threshold and University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Olfactory Event-Related potentials (OERP) were performed on 49 patients. At follow-up (mean 15.3 months), patients were diagnosed as 'PD' or 'non-PD'. DaTSCAN images were assessed visually and semi-quantitatively by QuantiSPECT. RESULTS: The sensitivity of UPSIT (86%) was not significantly different from that of the DaTSCAN (92%). UPSIT correlated moderately with DaTSCAN uptake (r = 0.44; P < 0.005) and UPDRS score (r = 0.43; P < 0.05) and weakly with symptom duration (r = 0.25; P < 0.05). In the PD group, OERP showed increased latency but no change in amplitude and no correlation with DaTSCAN. EGM thresholds were impaired in 22% of the PD group but they did not correlate with any other test parameters. DaTSCAN-UPSIT discordance was found in nine patients with PD, but neither was diagnostically superior. CONCLUSION: Our patients with early PD have a frequent and severe olfactory deficit that correlates with disease severity, symptom duration and DaTSCAN but not EGM. The sensitivities of UPSIT and DaTSCAN are high at 86% and 92%, respectively. Although DaTSCAN is superior for 'localization', UPSIT is considerably 'cheaper', and neither is disease specific. EGM threshold impairment in PD is independent of the smell deficit, and probably signifies advanced disease.

20842690|t|Use of smell test identification in Parkinson's disease in Mexico: a matched case-control study.
20842690|a|Smell tests can be useful in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) but are affected by cultural factors. Currently there is no smell test tailored for the Mexican population but the brief smell identification test (B-SIT) was created as a cross-cultural SIT. We have created a translation of this test into Spanish adapted to the Mexican population and have applied it to 70 PD patients and 70 age- and gender-matched controls. The B-SIT differentiated PD and controls with 71.4% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity, when subjects were divided into two age groups.

21487981|t|[Pathological changes of the chemosensory function in multiple sclerosis - an MRI study].
21487981|a|PURPOSE: To examine possible causes for olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in MS patients in a prospective study with MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 MS patients (21 women, 11 men, 22 - 65 years, O 42 years) were examined by MRI. The olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory brain volume was correlated with the number and volume of MS lesions in the olfactory brain and the non-olfactory brain. Olfactory testing was performed using the Threshold-Discrimination-Identification Test (TDI), and gustatory function was tested using the Taste-Strips-Test (TST). RESULTS: 33 % of the MS patients displayed olfactory dysfunction (8 % of the control group), and 17 % displayed gustatory dysfunction (5 % of the control group). There was a correlation between the olfactory brain volume and the number (r = -0.38, p < 0.05) and volume (r = -0.38, p < 0.05) of MS lesions in the olfactory brain. The olfactory brain volume correlated with the number of MS lesions in the non-olfactory brain (r = -0.48, p < 0.05). The volume of the left OB correlated with the volume of MS lesions in the olfactory brain (r = -0.42, p < 0.05), the number (r = 0.37, p < 0.05) and volume (r = 0.4, p < 0.05) of lesions in the left part of the olfactory brain and with the TST score (r = -0.45, p < 0.05). The TST score correlated with the volume of lesions in the left (r = -0.45, p < 0.05) and right part (r = -0.53, p < 0.05) of the olfactory brain. The TST score correlated with the number of lesions in the non-olfactory brain (r = -0.48, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The correlation between a higher number and volume of MS lesions in the olfactory brain with a decreased OB and olfactory brain volume could help to explain olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in MS patients. Just the left OB correlated with the number and volume of lesions in the olfactory brain. Manual segmentation was a suitable method for measuring OB and olfactory brain volume.

22227345|t|Validation of a new scale to assess olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease.
22227345|a|UNLABELLED: BAKCKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is present in up to 90% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It is usually evaluated by means of objective standardized tests; however no self-administered scales have been developed for olfactory dysfunction bedside assessment. We present validation of a new scale to assess this symptom in PD patients. METHODS: Seventy-five PD patients and 25 control subjects were evaluated using a Hyposmia Rating Scale developed in-house, combined with the extended Sniffin' Sticks test. RESULTS: Total score of the 6-item Hyposmia Rating Scale showed significant correlation with threshold, discrimination, identification and total Sniffin' Sticks test scores (r = 0.53; r = 0.60; r = 0.57; r = 0.65 respectively, p < 0.001 for all values). Area under the curve of the receiver operating curve for the ability of Hyposmia Rating Scale to discriminate patients with Sniffin' Sticks test total scores below or above the cut-off point was 80 +- 6% (p < 0.001). Considering Sniffin' Sticks test as the gold standard method for olfactory dysfunction detection, an affirmative response to a single screening question about smelling ability problems showed 35% sensitivity (95%CI = 23-47%) and 100% specificity. The best cut-off point for Hyposmia Rating Scale was 22.5 with a sensitivity of 70% (60-81%) and a specificity of 85% (65-100%). CONCLUSION: The Hyposmia Rating Scale here presented may offer a simple, cost-effective, time-saving and reliable approach to evaluate olfactory dysfunction in PD patients.

22364958|t|Application of odor identification test in Parkinson's disease in China: a matched case-control study.
22364958|a|As one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), hyposmia is of great importance in establishing the early diagnosis of PD. To date, there are still no studies on the application of the 16-item odor identification test from Sniffin' Sticks (SS-16) in Chinese patients with PD. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of SS-16 in Chinese PD patients (n=110) compared with age and gender matched controls (n=110), and to explore the associated factors with olfactory function in PD patients. The 16 odors in the original odor identification test were retained but some alternative descriptions were developed before applications. Mean identification scores in patients were significantly lower than in controls (7.3 +- 2.8 VS. 11.6 +- 2.0 P<0.01), with 66.4% of patients had an impairment of odor identification as evaluated by 95% confidential interval of the identification score of the control group. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed 86% sensitivity and 81% specificity in separating PD and healthy controls with a cut-off value of 9.5. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that autonomic dysfunction was a significant influential factor of odor identification scores in patients with PD. In conclusion, SS-16 provides a valid instrument for olfactory assessment in Chinese PD patients, and hyposmia may correlate with autonomic dysfunction in patients with PD.

22849610|t|Individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease show differential patterns of ERP brain activation during odor identification.
22849610|a|BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that older adults at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease may show olfactory processing deficits before other signs of dementia appear. METHODS: We studied 60 healthy non-demented individuals, half of whom were positive for the genetic risk factor the Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele, in three different age groups. Event-related potentials to visual and olfactory identification tasks were recorded and analyzed for latency and amplitude differences, and plotted via topographical maps. RESULTS: Varying patterns of brain activation were observed over the post-stimulus epoch for epsilon4- versus epsilon4+ individuals on topographical maps. Individuals with the epsilon4 allele demonstrated different ERP peak latencies during identification of olfactory but not visual stimuli. High correct ApoE classification rates were obtained utilizing the olfactory ERP. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory ERPs demonstrate functional decline in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease at much earlier ages than previously observed, suggesting the potential for pre-clinical detection of AD at very early stages.

22854689|t|[Evaluation of olfaction in healthy subjects using the Sniffing Sticks battery].
22854689|a|BACKGROUND: Olfaction dysfunction is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, therefore the evaluation of this function is becoming important AIM: To evaluate olfaction in healthy participants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 44 healthy males and 55 females, aged 21 to 89 years with the Sniffing Sticks battery to determine normal values in Chilean population. During the test, participants must correctly identify 12 different odors. RESULTS: Normal olfaction, hyposmia and anosmia were defined. An age related decline in olfaction was observed, especially among males aged 59 years or more. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides age and gender specific normal values for the Sniffing Sticks battery.

23146877|t|Sleepiness at the time of testing impairs olfactory performance.
23146877|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the differential roles of hypocretin versus dopamine dysfunction versus excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in the development of hyposmia. Olfaction in patients with Parkinson disease, restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy with cataplexy, EDS, and healthy controls was compared. METHODS: Sixty-six subjects participated in the study: 14 with PD, 13 with NC, 12 with RLS, 8 with EDS, and 20 healthy controls. Olfaction was tested using standardized Sniffin'Sticks test. Sleepiness was assessed using Karolinska, Stanford and Epworth sleepiness scales. RESULTS: Olfactory discrimination correlated negatively with subjective momentary sleepiness. A significant deficit in olfaction was found in PD patients with respect to all other groups in all olfactory domains. No significant differences were found between the other groups. CONCLUSION: We could not confirm decreased olfaction in patients with NC. Yet the significant correlation between momentary sleepiness and olfactory function suggests that sleepiness is a potential confounding factor in the assessment of olfaction, e.g. in NC. Furthermore, our results confirm that olfaction is impaired in PD, whereas it is normal in RLS.

23975523|t|The use of University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in Italy.
23975523|a|Hyposmia is a common finding in Parkinson's disease (PD). The 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-40) has been adapted and administered in several countries as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of PD. We have developed a culturally adapted version of the UPSIT-40 and applied it to 61 nondemented Italian controls and to 68 PD patients. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the factors that independently influence UPSIT-40 and logistic regression analysis was employed to study the usefulness of UPSIT-40 to predict PD diagnosis. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that PD diagnosis (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.006), gender (p = 0.003) and smoking status (p = 0.03) were significant independent predictors of the UPSIT-40 total score. Using diagnosis as dependent variable, logistic regression analysis showed that UPSIT-40 total score (p < 0.001) was an independent predictor of PD. Using a score <= 21/40 as a cut-off point for assigning subjects to PD group, the UPSIT-40 total score differentiated PD and control subjects with 82 % sensitivity and 88.2 % specificity. The adapted version of UPSIT-40 may be useful in addition to clinical examination to improve accuracy of diagnosis of PD in Italian population.

24005726|t|Use of Indian smell identification test for evaluating olfaction in idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients in India.
24005726|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease (PD) has been recognized for a long time and a number of studies have been performed in various parts of the world, using culturally appropriate smell identification tests. OBJECTIVE: In this study, for the first time, olfactory function has been assessed in the Indian Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) patients using an indigenously developed smell test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Olfaction was assessed in 53 IPD patients and 50 healthy controls using SniffIn-sticks   test and Indian Smell Identification test (INSIT). In both these tests, the subjects were asked to identify the smell from a set of choices and were scored out of 10 and 12 for INSIT and SniffIn-sticks   test, respectively. RESULTS: Both SniffIn-sticks   test and INSIT showed significant impairment in olfaction in IPD patients (P < 0.001). There was no significant correlation of the scores of both tests with Hoehn and Yahr (H and Y) stage, duration of illness and Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD). The tests had a high correlation, r = 0.75 (P < 0.001) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves did not differ significantly. Using a cut off value of 4 (values <= 4 indicating disease), INSIT showed a sensitivity of 79.2% and specificity of 78%. CONCLUSION: INSIT, being cheap, convenient and more acceptable in the Indian population, can be considered as a better alternative for SniffIn-sticks   test in the evaluation of olfaction in Indian PD subjects.

24577030|t|[Diagnostics of olfactory disorders in the patients with Parkinson's disease and polypous sinusitis with the use of the Sniffin' Sticks test].
24577030|a|The objective of the present study was the characteristic of the sense of smell and comparison of its peculiarities in the patients presenting with Parkinson's disease and polypous sinusitis based on the results of otorhinolaryngological examination with the use of the Sniffin' Sticks test. A total of 31 patients with polypous rhinosinusitis (PRS) (18 men and 17 women at the age of 44-58 years ) and 97 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (47 men and 50 women at the age of 50-56 years) were enrolled in the study. It was shown that 85% of the patients with PRS and PD suffered from olfactory disorders. The evaluation of selected parameters determined by the Sniffin' Sticks test demonstrated the impairment of the sense of smell in 48% of the patients with PRS and in 54% of those having PD. The main difference between the two groups was in the odour threshold that was reduced in 97% of the patients with PRS and in 72% of the cases with PD and in the ability to distinguish between odours that was compromised in 37% and 78% of these patients respectively.

24637980|t|Low specificity and sensitivity of smell identification testing for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
24637980|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if the University of Pennsylvania's Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is an accurate diagnostic tool for olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHOD: We included 138 non-demented PD subjects and 175 control subjects matched by gender. Smell identification was tested using UPSIT. RESULTS: The mean number of UPSIT items correctly identified by controls was 27.52 +- 5.88; the mean score for PD subjects was 19.66 +- 6.08 (p=<0.001). UPSIT sensitivity was 79.7% with a specificity of 68.5% using a cut-off score of <= 25. The overall accuracy for the diagnosis of PD was of 75.3%. CONCLUSION: UPSIT accuracy and specificity were lower than what has been previously reported. Our data demonstrates that 17.5% of items of the UPSIT were not well identified by healthy controls. Further research of the identification of a truly cross-cultural test is warranted.

24697954|t|Disorders of "taste cognition" are associated with insular involvement in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: "memory of food is impaired in dementia and responsible for poor diet".
24697954|a|BACKGROUND: In dementia patients, dietary intake problems may occur despite the absence of swallowing problems. We investigated cognitive functions on food and taste in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) patients. METHODS: Participants included 15 healthy controls (HC), 30 AD and 20 VaD patients. Food Cognition Test: Replicas of three popular foods in Japan with no odors were presented visually to each participant, with the instruction to respond with the name of each food. Replicas of food materials were subsequently presented to ask whether they were included in these foods. Taste Cognition Test: Replicas of 12 kinds of foods were presented to describe their expected tastes. RESULTS: The AD/VaD groups exhibited significantly lower scores on Food/Taste Cognition Tests compared with the HC group. These scores correlated inversely with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the AD group. Decreased dietary intake was observed in 12 of the 50 patients; 8 of the 12 exhibited decreased Taste Cognition Test scores, higher than that of the normal-intake patients. There was no difference in the filter paper taste disc test between HC/AD/VaD groups. To test the hypothesis that the insula is associated with taste cognition, two MMSE-matched AD subgroups (n = 10 vs. 10) underwent positron emission tomography. Glucose metabolism in the right insula was lower in the low taste cognition subgroup. The VaD patients with insular lesions exhibited impaired Taste Cognition Test findings. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider the cognitive aspect of dietary intake when we care for dementia patients.

25158564|t|[A case report of Parkinson's disease presenting with olfactory disturbance as a primary symptom in the early stage].
25158564|a|We report herein on a 71 year-old male who presented with olfactory disturbance at the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Due to a persistent olfactory disturbance for 5 years, the patient visited our clinic and showed disorientation between the olfactory detection threshold and recognition in T&T olfactometry and scored 3 out of 12 points in OE. During the follow-up period, the typical symptoms of PD, including mask-like face and motor disturbance emerged, which led to the diagnosis of PD by the neurologist. Since it is generally accepted that olfactory disturbance precedes the appearance of motor disturbance in the early stage of PD, otolaryngologists should be aware of the necessity of olfactory tests for the patients with reported persistent olfactory disturbance, especially in elderly patients. In those cases where the patients present positive findings in olfactory tests without any particular cause, referral to neurologists is recommended.

25937615|t|Alterations in the limbic/paralimbic cortices of Parkinson's disease patients with hyposmia under resting-state functional MRI by regional homogeneity and functional connectivity analysis.
25937615|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia is a cardinal early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) demonstrates spontaneous neuronal activity. We hypothesized that there would be alterations in the olfaction-related regions of the limbic/paralimbic cortices in PD patients with obvious hyposmia by RS-fMRI. METHODS: We used the "Five Odors for Olfactory Detection Arrays" to test the threshold of olfactory detection (TOD) for 54 PD patients and 22 age-matched controls. Using the mean TOD of the control group, patients were subdivided into two groups: PD with obvious hyposmia (OH-PD, n = 38) and PD with none/less obvious hyposmia (NOH-PD, n = 16). The regional brain activity of all subjects was investigated using RS-fMRI, in combination with regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analysis. RESULTS: There were different ReHo values in the limbic/paralimbic cortices between the OH-PD and NOH-PD groups. ReHo was significantly decreased in OH-PD patients in parts of the traditional olfactory regions (e.g. the amygdala, olfactory gyrus, orbital frontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and insula) and some non-traditional olfactory centers (e.g. the rectal gyrus and superior temporal pole), while increased in the left anterior/posterior cingulate cortex. FC analysis revealed decreased functional connectivity within the limbic/paralimbic cortices, especially in regions with reduced ReHo in the OH-PD group. CONCLUSIONS: PD with hyposmia is related to altered functional activity not only in the traditional olfactory center, but also in some non-traditional olfactory regions of the limbic/paralimbic cortices.

28061384|t|Oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide disrupts olfactory information output by impairment of local inhibitory circuits in rat olfactory bulb.
28061384|a|Although early olfactory dysfunction has been found in patients with Alzheimer's disease, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) affects the responses of mitral cells (MCs). We found that oligomeric Abeta1-42 increased spontaneous and evoked firing rates but decreased the ratio of evoked to spontaneous firings in MCs. Abeta1-42 oligomers showed no impact on the hyperactivity exerted by pharmacological blockage of GABAA receptors, suggesting an involvement of GABAergic inhibitory transmission in Abeta1 to 42-induced over-excitability. It was further determined that Abeta1-42 oligomers inhibited the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, as well as the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in MCs. Both recurrent and lateral inhibition of MCs, which are critical for odor discrimination, were also disrupted by Abeta1-42 oligomers. The above data indicate that Abeta impairs local inhibitory circuits and thereby leads to perturbations of olfactory information output in the olfactory bulb. This study reveals a cellular and synaptic basis of olfactory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease.

30670747|t|Partial depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra impairs olfaction and alters neural activity in the olfactory bulb.
30670747|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a major non-motor symptom that appears during the early stages of Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Depletion of SN dopaminergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is widely used as a model for PD and ultimately results in motor deficits. However, it is largely unknown whether olfactory behavior and, more importantly, neural activity in the olfactory bulb (OB) are impaired prior to the appearance of motor deficits. We partially depleted the SN dopaminergic population in mice by injection of 6-OHDA. Seven days after injection of 6-OHDA, motor ability was unchanged but olfactory-driven behaviors were significantly impaired. Injection of 6-OHDA into the SN significantly increased the power of the ongoing local field potential in the OB for all frequency bands, and decreased odor-evoked excitatory beta responses and inhibitory high-gamma responses. Moreover, 6-OHDA treatment led to increased odor-evoked calcium responses in the mitral cells in the OB of awake mice. These data suggest that the olfactory deficits caused by depletion of the SN dopaminergic population are likely due to abnormal hyperactivity of the mitral cells in the OB.

30895397|t|The flavor test is a sensitive tool in identifying the flavor sensorineural dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
30895397|a|Gustatory perception has been poorly explored in Parkinson's disease (PD). Aim of this study was to assess the flavor ability in PD patients, using the "flavor test" (FT), a new standardized and validated tool to examine the flavor perception. Thirty-eight patients (17 F and 21 M) and 36 control subjects (15 F and 21 M) comparable for age and gender were enrolled. All the subjects underwent the flavor test (FT), the Sniffin' Sticks test (SST), and the gustometry test (GT), based on the basic four tastants ("salty," "sour," "sweet," and "bitter"). PD patients presented a FT score significantly lower than controls (p < 0.001). Olfaction (SST) was impaired in PD in comparison with controls (p < 0.001), and the patients also showed a mild reduction of basic tastant identification at the GT (p = 0.08), with a trend toward statistical significance. There was no correlation between SST, FT, and GT. GT performance was negatively correlated with disease severity (p = 0.004) and stage (p = 0.024). The SST and FT resulted abnormal in PD in comparison with controls, independently of disease duration and severity. The ability to identify the basic four tastants was correlated with the disease severity and stage in PD patients suggesting that it might occur later in the course of the disease. FT might be a sensitive tool in identifying the sensorineural perception dysfunction in PD, even in the early stage and regardless of the disease severity.

31050946|t|Rapid Reversal of Cognitive Decline, Olfactory Dysfunction, and Quality of Life Using Multi-Modality Photobiomodulation Therapy: Case Report.
31050946|a|Objective: We present a case report of reversal of cognitive impairment, olfactory dysfunction, and quality of life measures in a patient with cognitive decline after multi-modality photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. Background: Transcranial and intranasal PBM has been introduced as a light-based therapeutic technique in which exposure to low levels of red to near-infrared (NIR) light stimulates neuronal function, leading to beneficial neurological effects. Materials and methods: Patient received twice-daily PBM therapy at home using three different wearable light-emitting diode (LED) devices. For the first week containing a mixture of continuous wave mode red (635 nm) and NIR (810 nm) LEDs, a prototype transcranial light helmet and a body pad were used. The body pad was placed on various areas on the lower back and the helmet was worn while seated. After the first week of treatment, an intranasal LED device, 10-Hz pulsed wave mode NIR (810 nm), was initiated in the left nostril twice daily. All three devices were applied simultaneously for an irradiation time of 25 min per session. Results: The patient showed a significant improvement in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score from 18 to 24 and in the Working Memory Questionnaire score from 53 to 10. The cognitive enhancement was accompanied by reversal of olfactory dysfunction as measured by the Alberta Smell Test and peanut butter odor detection test. Quality-of-life measures improved and caregiver stress was reduced. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: PBM therapy may be a promising noninvasive approach for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

31606429|t|A single intranigral administration of beta-sitosterol beta-d-glucoside elicits bilateral sensorimotor and non-motor alterations in the rat.
31606429|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neuropathology characterized by motor and non-motor alterations. beta-sitosterol beta-d-glucoside (BSSG) is a neurotoxin whose prolonged oral administration in rats has been proposed as a new PD model. Herein, we demonstrate that a single, unilateral, and intranigral administration of BSSG also elicits bilateral sensorimotor alterations in the rat. Six behavioral tests evaluated the effect of different concentrations of BSSG (3, 6, 9, and 12 mug/muL DMSO) from 15 to 120 days after administration. The first behavioral alterations, which appeared on day 15, were unbalanced and uncoordinated gaits and a decrease in the sensorimotor cortex activity, as evidenced by the beam-walking and the vibrissae tests, respectively. After 30 days, the corridor test revealed hyposmia and a decreased locomotor activity in the open field. The last alteration was a depressive-like behavior, as shown by the forced swim test on days 60 and 120. According to the cylinder test, no locomotor asymmetry was observed over time with any BSSG concentrations tested. Also, a mesencephalic TH(+) cell loss (p <  0.05) was shown on day 30 when compared with the mock condition, and such a loss was even higher on day 120. At this time, the presence of pathological alpha-synuclein aggregates in the mesencephalon was documented. Our results show that the stereotaxic intranigral administration of BSSG reproduces some characteristics of oral administration, such as the progression of behavioral alterations, dopaminergic neurons loss, and the presence of Lewy body-like synuclein aggregations, in less time and resources.

34693486|t|Clinical significance of the cognition-related pathogenic proteins in plasma neuronal-derived exosomes among normal cognitive adults over 45 years old with olfactory dysfunction.
34693486|a|OBJECTIVES: Exosomal Phospho-Tau-181(P-T181-tau), Total tau (T-tau), and amyloid-beta peptide 42 (Abeta42) have been proved the capacity for the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore the cognitive function and the levels of P-T181-tau, T-tau, and Abeta42 in neuronal-derived exosomes (NDEs) extracted from plasma in normal cognitive adults over 45 years old with olfactory dysfunction. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 29 participants aged over 45 was conducted. Plasma exosomes were isolated, precipitated, and enriched by immuno-absorption with anti- L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) antibody. NDEs were characterized by CD81, and extracted NDE protein (P-T181-tau, T-tau, and Abeta42) biomarkers were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs). Olfactory performance was assessed by Sniffin' Sticks and cognitive performance was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between adults with olfactory dysfunction and without olfactory dysfunction regarding the cognitive function as measured by MoCA and all the participants showed normal cognition. Adults with olfactory dysfunction showed a higher concentration of P-T181-tau in plasma NDEs than did adults without olfactory dysfunction (P = 0.034). Both the levels of P-T181-tau (r = - 0.553, P = 0.003) and T-tau (r = - 0.417, P = 0.034) negatively correlated with the odor identification scores. In addition, the level of T-tau negatively correlated with MoCA scores (r = - 0.597, P = 0.002). The levels of P-T181-tau (r = - 0.464, P = 0.022) and T-tau (r = - 0.438, P = 0.032) negatively correlated with the delayed recall scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that cognition-related pathogenic proteins including P-T181-tau in plasma NDEs were significantly increased in adults over 45 years old with olfactory dysfunction before the occurrence of cognitive impairment. The impaired odor identification and the delayed recall function were highly associated with the increased levels of P-T181-tau and T-tau in plasma NDEs.

2961789|a|Forty-two patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), 38 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and matched normal controls were administered tests of olfactory, verbal, and visual recognition after being screened for normal olfactory discrimination. Early-affected Huntington's patients (EHD) with minimal chorea or cognitive deficit displayed marked deficits in olfactory recognition despite normal verbal and visual performance, even after correction for task difficulty, suggesting involvement of olfactory brain regions early in the disease process. In the early Alzheimer's group (EAD), marked deficits were seen on all recognition modalities indicating more global impairment. Both overall (early plus late) patient groups were impaired relative to controls on all recognition tasks, with the olfactory paradigm being most affected.

3619712|t|The neurologic examination in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease.
3619712|a|Abnormal findings on a standardized neurologic examination were compared between patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy control subjects. Aside from mental status findings, the most useful examination findings for differentiating AD from control subjects were the presence of release signs, olfactory deficit, impaired stereognosis or graphesthesia, gait disorder, tremor, and abnormalities on cerebellar testing. These abnormalities probably reflect the different areas of the central nervous system that are affected pathologically in AD. In the clinical diagnosis of AD, particular attention should be given to these aspects of the neurologic examination.

7324865|t|[Olfaction and dementia. Preliminary results of a clinical and experimental study with N-propanol].
7324865|a|Various reports concerning the oro-alimentary ducts of dements and increasing arguments in favour of a new etiopathogenic hypothesis for Pick's disease, involving impaired zinc metabolism and histological lesions partly linked with the hodology of the olfactory system, lie at the origin of our present clinical interest in olfaction. In a first stage, using a technique based on dilution with N-propanol, we observed certain conditions permitting an evaluation of the olfactory capacities of patients with Pick's disease, senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescense. There does not seem to be a decline in olfaction with age. Olfactory capacities in the two forms of dementia studied were distinctly inferior to those of non-dements. Olfactory habituation was more marked, especially in Pick's disease where there were also paradoxical responses which seemed to form part of a more general change in reaction to stimulus. In senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescence the response to olfactory stimulus declines with dilution of N-propanol and lesional extension. Observation of recorded parameters (EEG, psycho-galvanic reflex, ocular movement, breathing) is useful in Pick's disease and may be difficult in senile plaque dementia and neurofibrillary degenerescence. Olfactory capacities appear to constitute an additional criterion on which to base a diagnosis of dementia. They could be used to help establish the neuro-biological bases of certain types of demential behaviour and to observe the progress of tentative therapies.

8022691|t|Olfactory deficits in Down subjects: a link with Alzheimer disease.
8022691|a|Two groups of subjects, 14 young (ages 20 to 31 years) and 14 adults (ages 32 to 54 years), both groups with Down Syndrome, were examined on a matching and naming olfactory task. On the former, subjects were required to recognize among four a previously sniffed odour, while on the latter they had to label an odour by choosing among four alternatives provided by the examiner. Analysis indicated that the adults with Down Syndrome scored worse than the young group on both tasks and that the impairment of the two groups was more pronounced on the matching task. On considering the similarity between the neurodegenerative brain pathology exhibited by Alzheimer patients and Down subjects and a recent observation that the former show pathological changes also in the olfactory epithelium (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), these two olfactory tasks could represent a useful noninvasive diagnostic method.

9258893|a|In the present study we assessed olfactory identification ability using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 16 elderly patients with schizophrenia (ES), 20 patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 20 healthy elderly controls (EC). Both patient groups exhibited marked deficits in UPSIT performance relative to controls. ES and AD patients with similar levels of general cognitive impairment did not differ on the UPSIT, suggesting that the two disorders may share a common dysfunction in olfactory brain regions. While there have been recent reports of greater olfactory impairment in males, neither patient group exhibited significant gender differences on the UPSIT.

9267974|t|Olfactory dysfunction for pyridine and dementia progression in Alzheimer disease.
9267974|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether odor detection sensitivity for pyridine, suggested by previous research not to be affected, is impaired in Alzheimer disease (AD) and whether an association exists between odor threshold and both degree of dementia and rate of dementia progression in AD. METHOD: The method of constant stimuli was used to determine odor thresholds for pyridine in 18 patients with AD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria) and 16 healthy elderly control subjects. All participants were carefully examined with medical and neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Six patients with AD but none of the controls were anosmic (total olfactory loss) to pyridine, and the 12 nonanosmic patients had significantly higher detection thresholds (50% probability for detection, 323 parts per billion [ppb]) than did the controls (50% probability for detection, 105 ppb). In addition, an association was found between odor threshold and both degree of dementia and rate of dementia progression in AD. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous findings, our results provide evidence that odor sensitivity in AD is impaired for pyridine. Odor sensitivity, in addition to other suggested predictors of progression rate, may be of interest for defining subgroups of AD or for clinical prognostic judgments of single patients.

9929680|t|Apolipoprotein E status is associated with odor identification deficits in nondemented older persons.
9929680|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with moderate dementia show losses in olfactory threshold, odor identification and odor memory. Sensitivity and specificity of olfactory testing is significant, with the greatest power of accurate diagnosis in the more cognitively loaded olfactory tasks. In patients with very mild AD or in patients at risk for the disease because of their mild cognitive impairment, losses are apparent for odor identification, odor recognition memory and odor threshold, with the best sensitivity in the identification task. Persons who are either heterozygous or homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, although they show no dementia in the preclinical period. Evidence of olfactory dysfunction in this population might be reflective of an incipient dementing process. We have recently examined olfactory function in a group of normal elderly persons who have undergone genetic testing for the Apoe4 allele. These individuals consisted of all normal control subjects at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) who had undergone both the genetic testing and testing for olfactory function. All had been diagnosed as normal control participants by two different neurologists who applied the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINDS-ADRDA) criteria for dementia. Persons with a history of alcoholism, drug abuse, learning disability or neurologic or psychiatric illness (including depression) were excluded. In this population, persons with the Apoe4 allele showed significantly poorer odor identification than those without an epsilon 4 allele. Early appearance of olfactory deficits in the progression to AD in persons with the epsilon 4 allele suggests diagnostic utility in olfactory testing.

10483627|t|Considering olfactory stimulation for adults with age-related dementia.
10483627|a|Behavioral interventions and activities for adults with age-related dementias sometimes use olfactory stimulation; however, limitations to the usefulness of such stimulation are suggested by both neurological studies which show a large amount of degeneration in the cells of the olfactory bulb and studies of perception which indicate that adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias perform poorly on tests of smell identification and detection. Current approaches to using olfactory stimulation as a component of interventions for adults with age-related dementia may need to be either abandoned or reassessed.

10991655|t|Preclinical (premotor) Parkinson's disease.
10991655|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is an idiopathic disease caused by necrosis and apoptosis of dopaminergic cells in the brainstem, which are probably induced by oxidative stress. Current therapeutic strategies comprise symptomatic and restorative treatment. Neuroprotective treatment, however, is close to becoming reality. As neuroprotective therapy may be of particular benefit to the preclinical and/or very early PD patients, identifying patients in the early stages of the disease is a priority. Both [18F]dopa positron emission tomography (PET) and [123I]beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging may be useful tools in diagnosing early (preclinical) PD. As screening the whole population for preclinical PD is not realistic, one has to select subjects with a high risk for this disease. Olfactory disturbances, subtle neurocognitive dysfunction, visuomotor control abnormalities and, to a lesser degree, mood and personality disorders, have lately been suggested to precede or accompany early clinical motor hallmarks of PD. In an epidemiological study, 500 first-degree relatives of PD patients were assessed for these signs and symptoms, and [123I]beta-CIT SPECT was performed on patients in the top 10% and the bottom 10% with regard to sense of smell. In this report, the study design and initial data from this ongoing study will be presented.

11215591|t|Loss of olfaction in de novo and treated Parkinson's disease: possible implications for early diagnosis.
11215591|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common finding in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). As most studies reported on odor identification in more advanced and treated PD, we administered an odor detection, discrimination, and identification test to a heterogeneous, partly de novo, group of patients. Forty-one non-demented PD patients, 24 of whom had untreated early PD, and 18 healthy controls, were examined. Odor identification and discrimination data were corrected for odor detection scores. PD patients scored significantly lower on all olfactory tests. Interestingly, the subgroup of de novo patients with early PD also showed significant olfactory disturbances compared with healthy subjects. Within the PD group, using multiple regression analysis, we found a significant, negative correlation between odor discrimination measures and disease The present study is the first to describe decreased performance of PD patients on odor discrimination, in addition to the already well-established deficits in odor detection and identification. Furthermore, odor discrimination measures were related to disease severity, possibly indicating that at least some aspects of olfactory dysfunction in PD may be secondary to ongoing degenerative processes in PD. As significant olfactory impairments were found in early, de novo PD, olfactory tests may be useful in the early diagnosis of PD.

11385006|t|Anosmia in dementia is associated with Lewy bodies rather than Alzheimer's pathology.
11385006|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess olfactory function of patients with dementia. Odour detection ability is impaired in clinical Parkinson's disease. Evidence of impaired detection in patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease is inconsistent. No studies of olfaction have been neuropathologically validated. METHODS: The olfactory function of 92 patients with dementia and 94 controls was assessed using a simple bedside test as part of the Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA). Neuropathological assessment was made of cortical Lewy bodies and substantia nigra (SN) cell counts and of Alzheimer's disease in all 92 patients, 22 of whom had SN Lewy bodies and 43 of whom had only Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Patients with Lewy bodies were more likely to be anosmic than those with Alzheimer's disease or controls. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were not more likely to be anosmic than controls. Nor was anosmia associated with degree of neurofibrillary tangles, as assessed by Braak stage. Among subjects with Lewy bodies, overall cortical Lewy body scores and Lewy body density in the cingulate were higher in those who were anosmic. Consensus clinical criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies had a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 89%. In the absence of definite Alzheimer's disease, the criteria had sensitivity of 100%. In patients with definite Alzheimer's disease, anosmia was slightly more sensitive (55%) than the consensus criteria (33%). However, the addition of anosmia to the consensus criteria did not improve their overall performance. CONCLUSION: Dementia with Lewy bodies is associated with impaired odour detection. Misdiagnosis may have accounted for some previous reports of impaired odour detection in Alzheimer's disease. Simple but more sensitive tests of anosmia are required if they are to be clinically useful in identifying patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.

11901275|t|Severe dysosmia is specifically associated with Alzheimer-like memory deficits in nondemented elderly retirees.
11901275|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not (1) impaired olfactory function is associated with impaired memory on neuropsychological testing in healthy retirees, and if so then (2) whether memory impairment is most consistent with a mesiotemporal rather than frontal system disorder. METHODS: 173 independent residents of a continuing care retirement community were studied. Subjects completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and a battery of both general and specific cognitive measures that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Executive Interview (EXIT25). Subjects were examined twice over 3 years. RESULTS: UPSIT performance was normal in 21% and in the 'anosmic' range in 25% of subjects. Anosmic UPSIT performance was associated with significantly worse performance on all cognitive tests. However, only short-term verbal memory was independently associated with UPSIT-defined anosmia. This association remained significant after adjusting for the other cognitive and sociodemographic variables. The memory deficits of anosmic subjects were qualitatively consistent with a cortical type (type 1) dementing illness such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Over time, UPSIT-defined 'anosmic' cases suffered significantly greater declines on both the MMSE and the EXIT25, independently of baseline age, gender and MMSE score. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired odor identification in individuals without overt dementia is associated with an AD-like memory impairment and an increased rate of cognitive decline. The comorbid association of these deficits is consistent with the known hierarchical spread of preclinical AD pathology and may be a specific indicator of future clinical AD dementia.

11992207|t|Utility of olfactory identification test for diagnosing Chinese patients with Alzheimer's disease.
11992207|a|The present study examined the utility of two tests, the olfactory identification test and the olfactory threshold test, in detecting dementia of the Alzheimer's type in Chinese patients in Hong Kong. The olfactory identification test developed by Murphy, Anderson, and Markinson (1994) was utilized with some modifications of odor stimuli suitable for the Chinese culture. Results showed that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) identified significantly fewer odors and had significantly higher olfactory threshold than their age- and education-matched normal control subjects. With the cut-off point of 5 identified odors (out of 6), the olfactory identification test yielded a sensitivity of 83% in discriminating AD patients from normal controls which was consistent with that reported by Morgan, Nordin, and Murphy (1995). Thus, the present results suggested that the olfactory identification test could be applied cross-culturally for identifying patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

12012945|t|[Presymptomatic detection of Parkinson's disease].
12012945|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. More than half of these neurons are lost in a presymptomatic phase of an estimated 4-6 years duration. It is obvious that any type of treatment aimed at slowing down the disease process should preferably be applied in this presymptomatic phase. Presymptomatic detection of PD has therefore become an important goal. In a recent study in a population of 361 asymptomatic first degree relatives of PD patients, we were able to demonstrate that presymptomatic detection is possible by means of a combination of three olfactory processing tasks and [123l] beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. These results are a first step towards the development of a screening strategy that may be applied in the general population. Impairments of olfactory function, however, are not specific to PD but are also associated with other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) and certain lifestyle characteristics (e.g. smoking). In the next few years our research efforts will focus on two different approaches to develop a more specific screening strategy. First, olfactory processing tasks will be combined with tasks aimed at detecting subtle (visuo)motor disturbances and early cognitive impairments. In parallel, an effort will be made to define disease-specific patterns of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders.

15036403|t|Differences between recognition memory and remote memory for olfactory and visual stimuli in nondemented elderly individuals genetically at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
15036403|a|Recognition and remote memory for olfactory and visual stimuli were assessed in nondemented elderly individuals positive for the apolipoprotein E 4 allele and in 4 negative controls to examine whether the 4 allele differentially affects recognition and/or remote memory depending on the modality of stimulus to be remembered. Compared to controls, 4 positive individuals committed more false positive recognition memory errors for olfactory but not visual stimuli suggesting that 4 positive individuals may show false positive errors for olfactory stimuli before deficits for other stimuli are detectable. There were no significant differences in familiarity ratings (a proposed measure of remote memory) suggesting that brain areas involved in remote memory are not affected in nondemented 4 positive individuals. The results suggest that neuropathological changes in nondemented individuals genetically at risk for Alzheimer's disease may differentially affect memory processes.

15098191|t|[Clinical heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease. Different clinical profiles can predict the progression rate].
15098191|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative dementia that may disclose different cognitive, behavioral, psychiatric and functional symptoms since onset. These distinct cognitive profiles support the conception of clinical heterogeneity and account for AD's highly variable rate of progression. In spite of strict diagnostic criteria NINCS ADRDA's and DSM IV the clinical certainty is only about 85%. Mayeux define 4 subtypes: a). Benign: mild cognitive and functional impairment without focal signs and late onset behavioral signs, slow progression; b). Myoclonic: usually of presenile onset with severe cognitive deterioration, mutism and early onset myoclonus; c). Extrapyramidal: early onset akineto rigid signs with severe cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric involvement; d). Typical: gradual and progressive cognitive, behavioral and functional impairment. The differentiation of these subtypes will allow us to define discrete patterns of progression, to define prognostic subgroups, and to homogenize them for clinical research and drug trials. DEVELOPMENT: We examined 1000 charts of probable AD patients from the Santojanni Center. We found 42% extrapyramidal, 35% typical, 15% benign and 8% myoclonic. The early onset of parkinsonism and myoclonus predict a rapidly evolving cognitive impairment and a more severe rate of progression with psychiatric disorders and dependency in activities of daily living. (DADL) Patients with low level of education, low cognitive performance at entry as well as those with rapid rate of cognitive deterioration had a faster rate of progression to DADL. CONCLUSION: Delusions, low level of education, extrapyramidal signs and motor hyperactivity but not hallucinations, and anosognosia were the best non cognitive predictors of DADL.

15345810|t|Effects of the ApoE epsilon4 allele on olfactory function in Down syndrome.
15345810|a|The present study investigated the effects of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele, a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), on olfactory function in Down syndrome (DS). Brain areas critical to olfactory processing, particularly the entorhinal cortex, show the earliest neuropathological changes in AD. Functionally, odor identification has been shown to be impaired in AD and in persons with the epsilon4 allele. DS is also a risk factor for AD. Thus, we hypothesized greater impairment in epsilon4 positive DS participants. Olfactory function was assessed with the San Diego Odor Identification Test in 34 participants with DS and 34 normal controls. Genomic DNA was prepared from blood samples to obtain ApoE status for the DS participants. Results indicate (1) that participants with DS had significant deficits in olfactory functioning; and (2) that among DS participants, those with an epsilon4 allele had poorer odor identification than those without an epsilon4 allele. The results support the hypothesis that individuals with DS who have an additional genetic risk factor for AD, the ApoE epsilon4 allele, exhibit greater deficits in odor identification. Areas of the brain involved in odor identification may be particularly affected in individuals with DS who carry the epsilon4 allele.

15517435|t|Olfactory function in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease: effects of deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus.
15517435|a|Decrease of olfactory function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is a well-investigated fact. The present study aimed to investigate olfaction in PD patients with a specific focus on the effects of deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus. Eleven patients (age 42-67 years) participated in this study. Using the "Sniffin' Sticks", olfactory function was assessed based on butanol odor thresholds and the patients' ability to discriminate odors. Measures were taken with the stimulator being switched ON and OFF, respectively. While deep brain stimulation had no effect on odor thresholds, in hyposmic PD patients odor discrimination was found to be significantly higher during the ON period. This may indicate that deep brain stimulation has a positive effect on the cognitive processing of olfactory information in PD patients.

15548497|t|Olfactory function distinguishes vascular parkinsonism from Parkinson's disease.
15548497|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare olfactory function in vascular parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease diagnosed according to published clinical diagnostic criteria. METHODS: The University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT) was carried out in 14 patients with vascular parkinsonism, 18 with Parkinson's disease, and 27 normal controls matched for age, sex, and smoking status. RESULTS: UPSIT scores in vascular parkinsonism (mean 26.1, 95% confidence interval, 23.1 to 29.0) were significantly better than in Parkinson's disease (mean 17.1 (14.5 to 19.7)) (p<0.0001), and did not differ from the healthy controls (mean 27.6 (25.8 to 29.4)) (p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Testing olfactory function may be helpful in differentiating vascular parkinsonism from Parkinson's disease.

15637774|t|Differences in olfactory and visual memory in patients with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease and the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease.
15637774|a|Recognition and remote memory for odors, faces, and symbols were assessed in patients with pathologically confirmed Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBV), patients with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy elderly controls. On recognition memory tasks, LBV and AD patients showed significantly lower discriminability (d') than controls, particularly for olfactory stimuli. However no significant differences were found in the bias measure (c). When participants rated familiarity (a proposed measure of remote memory) of olfactory stimuli LBV and AD patients reported significantly lower familiarity than controls. Familiarity ratings were significantly lower in LBV patients than in AD patients for olfactory, but not for visual stimuli. Consistent with prior reports, the LBV patients showed significantly poorer odor thresholds than AD patients. The results suggest that recognition memory for olfactory stimuli is impaired in LBV and AD. However, patients with LBV are more impaired than patients with AD on tasks requiring remote memory for olfactory but not visual stimuli. The findings suggest that odor memory tasks may be useful in the assessment of LBV and AD.

15984022|a|University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test data from control subjects (n = 63), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 147), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 100) were analyzed to derive an optimal subset of items related to risk for Alzheimer's disease (ie, healthy through mild cognitive impairment to early and moderate disease stages). The derived 10-item scale performed comparably with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test in classifying subjects, and it strongly predicted conversion to Alzheimer's disease on follow-up evaluation in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Independent replication is needed to validate these findings.

16086127|t|Modern psychophysical tests to assess olfactory function.
16086127|a|The sense of smell significantly contributes to quality of life. In recent years much progress has been made in understanding the biochemistry, physiology and pathology of the human olfactory system. Olfactory disorders may arise not only from upper airway phlogosis but also from neurodegenerative disease. Hyposmia may precede motor signs in Parkinson's disease and cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest the complementary role of olfactory tests in the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative diseases. In this report we present a review of modern olfactory tests and their clinical applications. Although rarely employed in routine clinical practice, the olfactory test evaluates the ability of odour identification and is a useful diagnostic tool for olfaction evaluation. Olfactory screening tests are also available. In this work we strongly recommend the importance of an ENT evaluation before the test administration and dissuade from a self-administration of an olfactory test.

16202482|t|ApoE gene and familial risk of Alzheimer's disease as predictors of odour identification in older adults.
16202482|a|The study examined odour identification ability in healthy older adults at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recruited a sample (n = 24) of siblings related to probable AD cases and an age-matched control sample (n = 47). All participants were genotyped for the presence of the ApoE epsilon4 allele. Performance on a simple olfactory task of odour identification was compared according to positive family history of AD and ApoE epsilon4 status. The sibling group showed an odour identification deficit compared to the control group. Whilst there was no independent influence of ApoE epsilon4 status on odour identification, there was a significant interaction between positive family history and ApoE epsilon4 status. Sibling epsilon4 carriers showed the greatest odour identification deficit and their performance was significantly poorer than both the sibling non-epsilon4 carrier and control epsilon4 carrier groups. Odour identification deficits like those reported here are considered to be early cognitive markers of incipient AD. In this respect, these findings support the need to both monitor individuals at increased risk of the disease and introduce olfactory-mediated cognitive tasks into the diagnostic setting.

16259403|t|[Psychophysiological basis of smells].
16259403|a|There has been an increase in the use of psychophysiological techniques, especially event-related potentials (ERPs) to evaluate the effects of odor on the central nervous system. In the study of ERPs related to odor, there are two main methods of the odor presentation: (1) to investigate the olfactory ERP (OERP) or chemosensory ERP (CSERP), that is to calculate electrophysiological responses to odor stimulation as a trigger; (2) to compare ERP of mental functioning during the odor exposed condition with that of no odor exposure. The amplitude of contingent negative variation (CNV) varies with the odorant being present, when the odor is presented as a trigger and when it is administrated during a task. It is suggested that CNV changes depend on not only the odorant but the anticipation, expectation and emotion of the subject. The latency of the N1 component becomes shorter with increasing concentrations of odors. The N1 amplitude does not depend on the odor concentration while the amplitude of the auditory N1 strongly depends on the stimulus intensity. There is only one report that the olfactory mismatch negativity (MMN) is present in the CSERP. On the other hand, auditory MMN is not affected by odor administration. In relation to the P3 component, rare odors evoked a larger amplitude in contrast to frequent odors, as well as P3 evoked by other modalities. These ERP studies with odors are expected to be applied to such clinical settings as the differentiation between the anosmic patients and normosmic persons, the functional evaluation of patients with brain tumors, the earlier detection of dementia, and the objective evaluation of aromatherapy.

17846512|t|Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) perception in Parkinson disease.
17846512|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) sensitivity in Parkinson disease (PD) patients and healthy volunteers to determine whether taster status represented a simple vulnerability marker for PD. BACKGROUND: The inability to taste PTC has been associated with a number of medical illnesses not typically associated with taste impairment. Abnormalities in the function/expression of G protein-signaling pathways have been implicated in PTC perception and also in dopamine expression and regulation in PD. No study has yet probed whether PTC tasting is disrupted in PD. METHOD: PTC sensitivity was assessed in a small sample of 36 male PD patients and 20 healthy male comparison subjects using a standardized psychophysical method. RESULTS: A higher proportion of nontasters were found in patients relative to healthy comparison subjects. These differences were not explained by alterations in perception of basic taste intensity or age. Among patients, nontasters and tasters of PTC did not differ with regard to duration of illness, age of onset, severity of motor symptoms, or overall illness severity. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest an increase in the frequency of PTC nontaster status in PD. As phenotypic variation in PTC sensitivity is genetic in origin, this may represent a surrogate risk factor for the development of PD.

18321760|t|Olfactory tests in the diagnosis of essential tremor.
18321760|a|Most patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) have impaired smell function but it is unclear whether this is true for subjects with essential tremor (ET). If ET patients do not exhibit meaningful smell loss, then olfactory testing may help to distinguish PD from ET. We assessed olfactory function in 59 ET and 64 tremor-dominant PD patients using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and olfactory event-related potential (OERP). UPSIT scores were compared to those from 245 healthy controls, and OERPs were compared to those from 74 controls. Unlike the PD test scores, those of ET patients were indistinguishable from controls when the effects of age, age of onset, gender, and smoking were taken into account. ET patients with a family history of tremor scored significantly better than controls on the UPSIT, and their rate of decline with age was slower. The effect was not observed on OERP. Smell testing may help to distinguish between ET and tremor-predominant PD, and patients with family history of tremor may represent a subgroup whose olfactory function is enhanced by some unknown mechanism.

18981632|t|Smell identification in Japanese Parkinson's disease patients: using the odor stick identification test for Japanese subjects.
18981632|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to clarify the olfactory functions of Japanese patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) using the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J). METHODS: Fifty-four non-demented IPD patients (33 men and 21 women), ranging in age from 43 to 81 years (69.7+/-8.1 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched healthy controls who reported having no olfactory complaints were enrolled. OSIT-J consisted of 12 odorants familiar to Japanese subjects. Each subject sniffed each odor that was applied to paraffin paper. Next the subject chose 1 of 6 answers: 4 pictures associated with the odors labeled with their names, one of which was correct, and 2 other ones ("unknown" and "not detected"). RESULTS: The number of correct answers was significantly lower in the IPD group (4.4+/-2.7) than in the normal group (8.3+/-2.2) (p<0.0001). Even in IPD patients who could smell normal strength odors in subjective symptom, the number of correct answers decreased. The number of correct answers was not correlated with motor function, disease duration, or medication. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that the smell identification ability of Japanese IPD patients was impaired based on the OSIT-J.

19127581|t|Premotor Parkinson's disease: clinical features, detection, and prospects for treatment.
19127581|a|The period immediately before the onset of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) often has a recognizable phenotype with features including autonomic dysfunction and impaired olfaction. Subclinical dopaminergic cell loss can also be detected at this time using molecular imaging techniques. A greater recognition of the features of premotor PD and improvements in screening technologies have opened the possibility of predictive testing for PD. In addition to molecular imaging of the dopamine system, screening tests that can potentially be used to identify the physiological abnormalities in premotor PD include olfactory testing, imaging of the sympathetic innervation of the heart, transcranial ultrasound, and genetic testing for mutations known to cause hereditary PD. All of these technologies have trade-offs as screening tests for accuracy, availability, and costs. Using these tests in combination may produce a more favorable combination of reasonable cost and accuracy than using any single test alone. Ultimately, the value of screening for PD depends on development of neuroprotective treatments for PD that would create an imperative for early identification and treatment.

19138875|t|Prevalence of smell loss in Parkinson's disease--a multicenter study.
19138875|a|Previous data on the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) range from 45% to 90%. The present multicenter study aimed to provide data on the prevalence of smell loss in a large sample of PD patients from three independent populations. Olfactory sensitivity was tested in 400 patients from Australia, Germany, and The Netherlands by means of a psychophysical olfactory test, the "Sniffin' Sticks", which is comprised of 3 subtests of olfactory function. Out of the total number of patients 45.0% presented as functionally anosmic, 51.7% were hyposmic, whereas only 3.3% were normosmic. This indicates that 96.7% of PD patients present with significant olfactory loss when compared to young normosmic subjects. This figure falls to 74.5%, however, when adjusted to age-related norms. Thus, olfactory dysfunction should be considered as a reliable marker of the disease.

19559700|t|Somatostatin, tau, and beta-amyloid within the anterior olfactory nucleus in Alzheimer disease.
19559700|a|Impaired olfaction is an early symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD). This likely to reflect neurodegenerative processes taking place in basal telencephalic structures that mediate olfactory processing, including the anterior olfactory nucleus. Betaeta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in AD brain may relate to decline in somatostatin levels: somatostatin induces the expression of the Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin and somatostatin deficiency in AD may therefore reduce Abeta clearance. We have investigated the expression of somatostatin in the anterior olfactory nucleus of AD and control brain. We report that somatostatin levels were reduced by approximately 50% in AD brain. Furthermore, triple-immunofluorescence revealed co-localization of somatostatin expression with Abeta (65.43%) with Abeta and tau (19.75%) and with tau (2.47%). These data indicate that somatostatin decreases in AD and its expression may be linked with Abeta deposition.

20083801|t|Association of anosmia with autonomic failure in Parkinson disease.
20083801|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction and autonomic failure are gaining recognition as nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson disease (PD). This observational study assessed whether in PD anosmia and autonomic failure are related to each other or to neuroimaging evidence of striatal dopamine deficiency. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 23 patients with sporadic PD. Baroreflex-cardiovagal gain was quantified from the relationship between cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and baroreflex-sympathoneural function by responses of systolic pressure to the Valsalva maneuver and of hemodynamics and plasma norepinephrine (NE) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) levels to orthostasis. 6-[(18)F]Fluorodopamine PET and plasma and skeletal muscle microdialysate NE and DHPG were used to indicate cardiac and extracardiac noradrenergic innervation and brain 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa PET to indicate striatal dopaminergic innervation. Parkinsonism was assessed by UPDRS scores. RESULTS: Compared to patients with PD and normal to moderately decreased sense of smell, patients with anosmic PD had lower mean baroreflex-cardiovagal gain (p = 0.04), larger falls in systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and orthostasis (p = 0.04, p = 0.02), smaller orthostatic increments in plasma NE and DHPG (p = 0.003, p = 0.03), lower cardiac septal:hepatic and renal cortical:hepatic ratios of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity (p = 0.01, p = 0.06), and lower microdialysate NE and DHPG (p = 0.01; p = 0.006). Neither clinical severity of parkinsonism nor the putamen:occipital cortex ratio of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa-derived radioactivity was related to the UPSIT category. CONCLUSIONS: In Parkinson disease, anosmia is associated with baroreflex failure and cardiac and organ-selective extracardiac noradrenergic denervation, independently of parkinsonism or striatal dopaminergic denervation.

20721915|t|Impaired sense of smell and color discrimination in monogenic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
20721915|a|Olfaction is typically impaired in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), but its role is uncertain in monogenic PD. Diminished color discrimination has been suggested as another early sign of dopaminergic dysfunction but not been systematically studied. Furthermore, it is unknown whether both deficits are linked. We examined 100 patients with IPD, 27 manifesting mutation carriers (MC), 20 nonmanifesting mutation carriers (NMC), and 110 controls. Participants underwent a standardized neurological examination, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), the Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) color discrimination test, and mutation testing in known PD genes. The monogenic group consisted of 15 Parkin (6MC/9NMC), 17 PINK1 (10MC/7NMC), 8 LRRK2 (4MC/4NMC), 3 SNCA (MC), and 4 ATP13A2 (MC) carriers. Olfaction was most impaired in IPD (UPSIT percentiles 10.1 +- 13.5) compared with all other groups (MC 13.8 +- 11.9, NMC 19.6 +- 13.0, controls 33.8 +- 22.4). Within MC, carriers of two mutations in Parkin and PINK1 showed higher UPSIT percentiles than LRRK2 and SNCA carriers. Color discrimination was reduced in IPD (FM total error score 134.8 +- 92.7). In MC (122.4 +- 142.4), the reduction was most pronounced in LRRK2, NMC (80.0 +- 38.8) were comparable with controls (97.2 +- 61.1). UPSIT and FM scores were correlated in the control (r = -0.305; P = 0.002) and the IPD group (r = -0.303; P = 0.006) but not among mutation carriers. First, we confirmed olfaction and color discrimination to be impaired in IPD and suggest olfaction to be a premotor sign. Second, olfaction differed between carriers with one and two mutations in Parkin/PINK1-associated PD. Third, olfaction and color discrimination impairment do not necessarily evolve in parallel.

21287185|t|Diffusion tensor imaging and olfactory identification testing in early-stage Parkinson's disease.
21287185|a|Evidence from imaging, clinical studies, and pathology suggests that Parkinson's disease is preceded by a prodromal stage that predates clinical diagnosis by several years but there is no established method for detecting this stage. Olfactory impairment, which is common in Parkinson's disease and often predates clinical diagnosis, may be a useful biomarker for early Parkinson's. Evidence is emerging that diffusion imaging parameters might be altered in olfactory tract and substantia nigra in the early stages of clinical Parkinson's disease, possibly reflecting pathological changes. However, no study has examined olfaction and diffusion imaging in olfactory tract and substantia nigra in the same group of patients. The present study compared newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients with a matched control group using both olfactory testing and diffusion tensor imaging of the substantia nigra and anterior olfactory structures. Fourteen patients with stage 1-2 Hoehn & Yahr Parkinson's disease were matched to a control group by age and sex. All subjects then completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, as well as a series of MRI scans designed to examine diffusion characteristics of the olfactory tract and the substantia nigra. Olfactory testing revealed significant impairment in the patient group. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed significant group differences in both the substantia nigra and anterior olfactory region, with fractional anisotropy of the olfactory region clearly distinguishing the Parkinson's subjects from controls. This study suggests that there may be value in combining behavioral (olfaction) and MRI testing to identify early Parkinson's disease. Since loss of olfaction often precedes the motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, the important question raised is "will the combination of olfactory testing and MRI (DTI) testing identify pre-motor Parkinson's disease?"

21287786|t|Study on perfume stimulating olfaction with volatile oil of Acorus gramineus for treatment of the Alzheimer's disease rat.
21287786|a|OBJECTIVE: To probe into the therapeutic effect of perfume stimulating olfaction with volatile oil of Acorus Gramineus on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat. METHODS: Totally 50 adult SD rats, male,weighing 300 +/- 10 g, were randomly divided into 5 groups, normal group (group A), olfactory nerve severing model group (group B), AD model group (group C), AD model plus perfume stimulation group (group D), AD model olfactory nerve severing plus perfume stimulation group (group E), 10 rats in each group. After perfume stimulation, Morris maze test was conducted for valuating the learning and memory ability; Malondaldehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in the brain, and the brain weight were detected. RESULTS: Compared with the AD model group, the average escape latency and swimming distance in 6 days were significantly shorter than those in the group A, B, D (P < 0.01), with no significant differences between the group C and the group E (P > 0.05); Compared with the group A, B and D, MDA content in the group C significantly increased (P < 0.01), and SOD and GSH-Px activities significantly decreased (P < 0.01), and brain weight/body weight decreased significantly in the group C (P < 0.01), with no significant differences between the group C and the group E (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Perfume stimultating olfaction with volatile oil of Acorus Gramineus can significantly increase the learning-memory ability, decrease MDA content and increase SOD and GSH-Px activities and weight of brain in AD rats.

22035024|t|Premotor symptoms and early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
22035024|a|Parkinson's disease is a disorder characterized by the motor findings of bradykinesia, rest tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and postural instability. As the disease progresses, most patients develop numerous nonmotor signs and symptoms, many of which play a major role in reducing quality of life. What is becoming increasingly clear is that nonmotor findings, including hyposmia, sleep disorders, autonomic abnormalities, cognitive changes, and neurobehavioral changes, often precede the motor findings.

22192366|t|Olfaction in Parkinson's disease and related disorders.
22192366|a|Olfactory dysfunction is an early 'pre-clinical' sign of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present review is a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of such dysfunction in PD and related disorders. The olfactory bulb is implicated in the dysfunction, since only those syndromes with olfactory bulb pathology exhibit significant smell loss. The role of dopamine in the production of olfactory system pathology is enigmatic, as overexpression of dopaminergic cells within the bulb's glomerular layer is a common feature of PD and most animal models of PD. Damage to cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems is likely involved, since such damage is most marked in those diseases with the most smell loss. When compromised, these systems, which regulate microglial activity, can influence the induction of localized brain inflammation, oxidative damage, and cytosolic disruption of cellular processes. In monogenetic forms of PD, olfactory dysfunction is rarely observed in asymptomatic gene carriers, but is present in many of those that exhibit the motor phenotype. This suggests that such gene-related influences on olfaction, when present, take time to develop and depend upon additional factors, such as those from aging, other genes, formation of alpha-synuclein- and tau-related pathology, or lowered thresholds to oxidative stress from toxic insults. The limited data available suggest that the physiological determinants of the early changes in PD-related olfactory function are likely multifactorial and may include the same determinants as those responsible for a number of other non-motor symptoms of PD, such as dysautonomia and sleep disturbances.

22305338|t|Olfactory ERPs in an odor/visual congruency task differentiate ApoE epsilon4 carriers from non-carriers.
22305338|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory and semantic processing. AD patients and MCI patients at risk for AD show altered N400 ERP responses to incongruent visual and verbal stimuli. AD patients exhibit neuropathology in olfactory brain areas before cognitive symptoms, suggesting the potential for olfactory processing to reflect early pathology. Despite this, odor congruency has not been examined. We investigated odor-image congruency in older adults at genetic risk for AD. ApoE epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers were screened for anosmia, severe hyposmia, and dementia. Olfactory ERPs were measured 600-1300 ms following odor-image pairs. Odors were each presented once congruently and once incongruently via an olfactometer. Pz amplitude significantly decreased on incongruent trials in e4 carriers. Pz amplitude differences on congruous and incongruous trials were larger in non carriers. Regression indicated that congruency showed very high sensitivity and specificity for correctly classifying epsilon4 carriers from non-carriers.

22552846|t|Olfactory identification testing as a predictor of the development of Alzheimer's dementia: a systematic review.
22552846|a|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the utility of olfactory identification tests as prognostic instruments for Alzheimer's dementia (AD). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to determine the quality and quantity of longitudinal and cross-sectional research on this topic. RESULTS: Two prospective longitudinal cohort studies and 30 cross-sectional studies met inclusion criteria. The prospective longitudinal studies evaluated subjects with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) while also using olfactory identification testing as part of a neurocognitive evaluation. The first study reported an increased risk of later onset of AD in subjects with baseline hyposmia, whereas the second study suggested a possible relationship between decreased olfaction in participants with MCI and conversion to AD but was inconclusive due to low follow-up rates. Wide variability in the type of olfactory identification test used and the reporting of results precluded meta-analysis. The cross-sectional studies demonstrated a positive association between poorer performance on olfactory identification testing and AD. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is evidence suggesting an association between decreased olfaction and AD, rigorously designed longitudinal cohort studies are necessary to clarify the value of olfactory identification testing in predicting the onset of AD.

22737710|t|Neurochemistry and the non-motor aspects of PD.
22737710|a|Parkinson disease (PD) is a systemic disease with variegated non-motor deficits and neurological symptoms, including impaired olfaction, autonomic failure, cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms, in addition to the classical motor symptoms. Many non-motor symptoms appear before or in parallel with motor deficits and then worsen with disease progression. Although there is a relationship, albeit not causal, between motor symptoms and the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs) and neurites filled with abnormal alpha-synuclein, other neurological alterations are independent of the amount of alpha-synuclein inclusions in neurons and neurites, thereby indicating that different mechanisms probably converge in the degenerative process. This may apply to complex alterations interfering with olfactory and autonomic nervous systemfunctions, emotions, sleep regulation, and behavioral, cognitive and mental performance. Involvement of the cerebral cortex leading to impaired behavior and cognition is related to several convergent altered factors including: a. dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic cortical innervation; b. synapses; c. cortical metabolism; d. mitochondrial function and energy production; e. oxidative damage; f. transcription; g. protein expression; h. lipid composition; and i. ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, among others. This complex situation indicates that multiple subcellular failure in selected cell populations is difficult to reconcilewith a reductionistic scenario of a single causative cascade of events leading to non-motor symptoms in PD. Furthermore, these alterationsmay appear at early stages of the disease and may precede the appearance of substantial irreversible cell loss by years. These observations have important implications in the design of therapeutic approaches geared to prevention and treatment of PD.

22749843|t|Implicit olfactory processing attenuates motor disturbances in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
22749843|a|Many reports in the literature indicate that idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients have substantial olfactory dysfunctions even before motor symptoms become evident. It has not yet been clarified, however, if some form of implicit olfactory processing is preserved in this population. An olfactory visuomotor priming paradigm, which detects implicit olfactory processing in neurologically healthy participants, was utilized to investigate motor control in relation to olfactory signals in a group of IPD patients. Two control groups were also considered: 12 vascular Parkinson's disease (VPD) in whom normal olfactory abilities are typically reported and 12 neurologically healthy participants. All of the participants were asked to perform reach-to-grasp movements toward large or small targets following olfactory cues delivered by a computer-controlled olfactometer. The odor was either 'size' congruent with the target (e.g., strawberry or apple, respectively) or incongruent (e.g., apple or strawberry, respectively). A bend sensor glove (CyberGlove) was used to measure the hand kinematics. Facilitation effects were noted in all the groups with regard to movement time. If a congruent rather than an incongruent odor was delivered, the movement time of the reach-to-grasp was shortened and facilitation effects in maximum grip amplitude were noted in both the IPD and the VPD groups. The maximum grip amplitude was smaller when no odor, as compared to a congruent odor, was delivered. The present results suggest that implicit olfactory processing affects motor control in IPD patients favoring less severe bradykinesia and hand movement hypometria. Once confirmed, these findings could be useful when rehabilitation strategies are being hypothesized for these patients.

23377435|a|There is ample evidence from a large number of clinical and pathological studies of an early involvement of olfactory bulbs and cortex in the Lewy body pathology in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), the olfactory system being one of the first targets of degeneration in this condition. The olfactory dysfunction may be measurably present at the time of initial presentation and progresses in a proportion of patients as the disease advances. Patients with iPD have a more severe olfactory loss as compared to multisystem atrophy whereas the syndromes of corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy have no olfactory loss. A proportion of drug induced parkinsonism may have olfactory loss indicative of primary pathology of dopaminergic degeneration in these patients. Unlike single photon emission tomography, formal measurement of olfaction would provide a supportive role in diagnosing or excluding iPD depending on the duration of an individual patient's parkinsonian symptoms. Whilst olfaction may be only minimally impaired in early stages and may thus not help to differentiate from other syndromes, an intact olfaction in patients with parkinsonism of few years' duration would indicate a non-iPD pathology. Olfactory measurement is easy, cheap and now easily available in a number of tests, and olfactory assessment at different stages of parkinsonism should be used as a diagnostic aid for idiopathic PD and would enhance the diagnostic accuracy of iPD when used in conjunction with the UK Parkinson's disease society Brain Bank supportive criteria for diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

23669447|t|Odor identification deficit predicts clinical conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
23669447|a|The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between olfactory and cognitive functions in subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to investigate whether olfactory deficits might reflect the likelihood of conversion from MCI to dementia. In this longitudinal study conducted on a sample of MCI outpatients, CA-SIT Smell Identification Test was administered to 88 MCI subjects and 46 healthy control subjects. MCI subjects have been divided into two groups, considering smell identification performances: 40% had normal performances (MCI olfactory-normal), whereas 60% had a moderate olfaction deficit (MCI olfactory-impaired). At 2-year follow-up, the 47% of MCI olfactory-impaired subjects and the 11% of MCI olfactory-normal subjects progressed to dementia. In a logistic regression model, a lower score in MMSE (95%, OR 1.9; IC 1.23-3.01; p = .004) and a pathological smell identification at baseline (95%, OR 5.1; IC 1.16-22.6; p = .03) were independently associated with the progression to dementia within 2 years. This study confirms that smell identification testing may be useful in high-risk settings to identify patients at risk for developing dementia.

23871228|t|Nicotine increases lifespan and rescues olfactory and motor deficits in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.
23871228|a|Drosophila melanogaster is an attractive model of familial Parkinson's disease, as flies with loss-of-function mutations of the parkin gene exhibit many pathologies observed in PD patients. Progressive motor deficits found in homozygous parkin mutants seem to result from mitochondrial pathology that causes indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration [1,2]. We have found that heterozygous parkin mutants have decreased lifespan, generally progressive motor dysfunction and olfactory deficits compared to control flies, suggesting that mutation of this gene produces a dominant phenotype. Tobacco smokers are dose-dependently less likely to develop PD [3,4]; subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies show that nicotine is protective in models of sporadic PD [6]. Literature addressing the potential protection by nicotine in Parkin loss-of-function models spans limited concentrations and selected time points in the organism's lifespan. We have found that parkin heterozygotes have late-onset climbing and flying deficits as well as decreased viability and olfactory deficits that precede motor defects. While chronic nicotine exposure decreases lifespan and climbing and flying abilities in control flies, it can improve viability and flying capability as well as rescue climbing and olfactory deficits in parkin heterozygotes. Dopaminergic neurons are spared in the parkin heterozygote, perhaps because this phenotype is less severe than in the homozygous parkin mutants. Nicotine pretreatment may be protective in sporadic PD patients and models; however, timely diagnosis remains to be an obstacle. Our results suggest that nicotine also may be protective in familial PD patients, who can be easily identified before motor symptoms occur.

24488133|t|A30P alpha-Synuclein interferes with the stable integration of adult-born neurons into the olfactory network.
24488133|a|Impaired olfaction is an early symptom in Parkinson disease (PD), although the exact cause is as yet unknown. Here, we investigated the link between PD-related mutant alpha-Synuclein (alpha-SYN) pathology and olfactory deficit, by examining the integration of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) of A30P alpha-SYN overexpressing mice. To this end, we chose to label one well-known vulnerable subpopulation of adult-born cells, the dopaminergic neurons. Using in vivo two-photon imaging, we followed the dynamic process of neuronal turnover in transgenic A30P alpha-SYN and wild-type mice over a period of 2.5 months. Our results reveal no difference in the number of cells that reach, and possibly integrate into, the glomerular layer in the OB. However, in mutant transgenic mice these new neurons have a significantly shortened survival, resulting in an overall reduction in the addition of neurons to the glomerular layer over time. We therefore propose unstable integration and impaired homeostasis of functional new neurons as a likely contributor to odour discrimination deficits in mutant alpha-SYN mice.

25262560|t|Long-term odor recognition memory in unipolar major depression and Alzheimer s disease.
25262560|a|Major depression and Alzheimer s disease (AD) are often observed in the elderly. The identification of specific markers for these diseases could improve their screening. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term odor recognition memory in depressed and AD patients, with a view to identifying olfactory markers of these diseases. We included 20 patients with unipolar major depressive episodes (MDE), 20 patients with mild to moderate AD and 24 healthy subjects. We investigated the cognitive profile and olfactory memory capacities (ability to recognize familiar and unfamiliar odors) of these subjects. Olfactory memory test results showed that AD and depressed patients were characterized by significantly less correct responses and more wrong responses than healthy controls. Detection index did not differ significantly between patients with major depression and those with AD when the results were analyzed for all odors. However, MDE patients displayed an impairment of olfactory memory for both familiar and unfamiliar odors, whereas AD subjects were impaired only in the recognition of unfamiliar odors, with respect to healthy subjects. If preservation of olfactory memory for familiar stimuli in patients with mild to moderate AD is confirmed, this test could be used in clinical practice as a complementary tool for diagnosis.

25511329|t|Reasons for mild parkinsonian signs - which constellation may indicate neurodegeneration?
25511329|a|INTRODUCTION: Mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) are common in the elderly population. Several factors including physical decline and comorbidities in addition to neurodegeneration may be possible sources for MPS. The objective was to examine whether MPS are associated with a history of orthopedic disturbances, vascular diseases or prodromal markers for neurodegeneration. METHODS: The TREND study is a prospective longitudinal cohort study in individuals >50 years with biennial assessments designed to identify prodromal markers for neurodegeneration. In this substudy, 1091 elderly individuals were evaluated for a possible association of MPS with prodromal markers for neurodegeneration, orthopedic disturbances, vascular diseases, as well as cerebral abnormalities. These factors were assessed by self-administered questionnaires, with a structured health interview, a neurological examination and by transcranial sonography. RESULTS: 82 participants showed MPS. They were found to have more often hyposmia and RBD, had a higher autonomic dysfunction score and they more frequently showed hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra compared to controls. Neither orthopedic disturbances nor vascular diseases were significantly associated with the prevalence of MPS. CONCLUSION: MPS might be a sign of early neurodegeneration rather than caused by other motor influencing diseases.

25944089|t|Olfactory dysfunction: its early temporal relationship and neural correlates in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
25944089|a|We interact with the physical world through our senses, and these aid our behavioral performance and various activities of life. Sensory information is transmitted in neuronal networks, and the brain optimally interprets the external and internal milieu/environment. This paper delineates the framework in which the pathogenesis of memory and cognitive dysfunction is underpinned by sensory olfactory dysfunction. ERC is the gateway for olfactory input to the hippocampus, and there is seamless synchronization between sensory function and hippocampal activity. Transmission of olfactory information to the hippocampus is sequential-it is projected from the olfactory receptors to olfactory bulb to the primary olfactory cortex (comprised the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, and the piriform cortex) to the entorhinal cortex (ERC). Through perforant pathway ERC enables olfactory inputs to effectively excite hippocampal neurons. One of the earliest pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the olfactory dysfunction and the atrophy in ERC and hippocampus (rate in ERC is higher than in the hippocampus). Olfactory dysfunction negatively impacts the ERC and the deafferenting of the hippocampus from olfactory inputs upregulates memory decline. Olfactory dysfunction, therefore, is an important and early correlate of AD pathology. A number of factors described here may cause olfactory dysfunction; this may lead to hypoperfusion, hypometabolism, impaired synaptic transmission, and variable atrophy in olfaction-related regions. Improvement in olfactory function, therefore, is an important goal in order to attenuate cognitive neuropathology in aging and AD. This article seeks to provide a comprehensive and balanced overview of olfactory neuropathology in incipient AD, and suggests strategies to enhance olfactory function and ameliorate cognitive decline.

25998001|t|Taste identification used as a potential discriminative test among depression and Alzheimer s disease in elderly: A pilot study.
25998001|a|Major Depression and Alzheimer s disease (AD) are two diseases in the elderly characterized by an overlap of early symptoms including memory and emotional disorders. The identification of specific markers would facilitate their diagnosis. The aim of this study was to identify such markers by investigating gustatory function in depressed and AD patients. We included 20 patients with unipolar major depressive episodes (MDE), 20 patients with mild to moderate AD and 24 healthy individuals. We investigated the cognitive profile (depression, global cognitive efficiency and social/physical anhedonia) and gustatory function (ability to identify four basic tastes and to judge their intensity and hedonic value) in all participants. We found that AD patients performed worse than healthy participants in the taste identification test (for the analysis of all tastants together); however, this was not the case for depressed patients. We found no significant differences among the three groups in their ability to evaluate the intensity and hedonic value of the four tastes. Overall, our findings suggest that a taste identification test may be useful to distinguish AD and healthy controls but further investigation is required to conclude whether such a test can differentiate AD and depressed patients.

26076880|t|Olfactory function and neuropsychological profile to differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment: A 5-year follow-up study.
26076880|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a well-known precursor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but often also precedes dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The early differentiation of DLB from AD is important to delay disease progression. Olfactory dysfunction is a well-known early sign of both AD and Lewy body disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and DLB. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether olfactory and neuropsychological tests can aid in the differentiation of DLB from AD at the MCI stage. METHODS: The present study included 122 MCI patients who were monitored until they developed dementia or until their condition stabilized; the follow-up period averaged 4.9 years (range: 3.9-6.2 years). Baseline olfactory function as measured with the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification (CCSI) test and neuropsychological data were compared. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 32 subjects developed probable AD (MCI-AD), 18 had probable DLB (MCI-DLB), 45 did not convert to dementia (MCI-stable), and eight developed a non-AD/DLB dementia. The mean CCSI score (95% confidence interval [CI]) in patients with MCI-DLB (4.6; 95% CI: 4.0-5.3) was significantly lower than that of MCI-AD patients (6.4; 95% CI: 6.0-6.7, p<0.001) and MCI-stable patients (7.3; 95% CI: 6.9-7.8, p<0.001). The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic to discriminate MCI-DLB from MCI-AD using CCSI scores was (0.84; 95% CI: 0.72-0.97). Frontal-executive function and visuospatial ability was worse in patients with MCI-DLB, while verbal recognition memory impairment was greater in those with MCI-AD. CONCLUSION: Olfactory and neuropsychological tests can help predict conversion to DLB or AD in patients with MCI.

26280301|t|Distinguishing Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies using cognitive and olfactory measures.
26280301|a|OBJECTIVE: Given poor sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria in identifying dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the use of cognitive and olfactory measures to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from DLB was assessed. METHOD: Twenty-six patients with DLB and 60 patients with AD were administered several cognitive measures and the Brief Smell Identification Task (BSIT). RESULT: Patients with DLB performed significantly worse on the BSIT and visuoconstruction tasks than patients with AD, but significantly better on delayed recall of a word list. Sensitivity and specificity of these measures in identifying DLB are presented for each of these tasks alone and in combination. The best balance of sensitivity and specificity was found with a combination of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and BSIT (81% sensitivity, 90% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: These data have practical implications by providing cut scores than can be used to emphasize either specificity or sensitivity in identifying patients with DLB.

27215014|t|A mini review: Tau transgenic mouse models and olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease.
27215014|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually takes many years from preclinical phase to prodromal phase characterized by mild symptoms before the onset of dementia. Once diagnosed with AD, the brain is already severely damaged and the disease will process quickly to the most severe stages since there is no medications that reverse the neuronal injuries in the brain. Thus, simple, inexpensive, and widely available methods for detecting potential AD patients during their preclinical phases are urgently needed. In such case, olfactory testing may offer a chance for early diagnosis of AD. However, there are limitations in these olfactory tests due to the complexity of the brain areas it extends to and the frequently olfactory fatigue occurred in the behavioral olfactory tests. Great efforts have been done epidemiologically to investigate the correlation between olfactory functions and possibility of developing AD. Different patterns of olfactory dysfunction have been found in AD at early stages and even mild cognitive impairment (MIC), but the cause of the dysfunction remained unclear. Various kinds of AD animal models have been used in the field to clarify the existence of olfactory dysfunctions and thus study the underling mechanism of the dysfunction. In this review we discuss (1) the function of Tau physiologically and pathologically; (2) the genetic background and biological characteristics of the most commonly used Tau transgenic mice; (3) the structural and molecule basis of olfaction; (4) the possible relationship between Tau pathology and olfactory dysfunction. Finally, we suggest that the tau transgenic mouse models may be helpful in studying the possible mechanisms of the dysfunction.

27497596|t|Exploring Olfactory Function and Its Relation with Behavioral and Cognitive Impairment in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study.
27497596|a|BACKGROUND: Behavioral and cognitive impairment are common in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and represent a continuum with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Olfactory dysfunction has been described in a subset of ALS patients and might be associated with frontotemporal and insular cortex dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate olfaction dysfunction in ALS patients and its relationship with either cognition or behavioral impairment. METHODS: 28 consecutive ALS patients underwent an extensive cognitive and behavioral battery and were classified as patients with normal cognition (ALS-N, n = 11) or with part of the ALS-FTD spectrum (n = 17), including either cognitive or behavioral impairment or dementia. Odor verbal and visual identification and discrimination were investigated in patients and age-matched controls using a test adapted from the Sniffin' Sticks. RESULTS: Olfactory function was significantly different between ALS-FTD spectrum patients and controls (p < 0.001) and inversely correlated with behavioral and cognitive performance. The 10-point cutoff distinguished ALS-N from ALS-FTD spectrum patients with a sensitivity and specificity of 71 and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia is common in a subset of ALS patients and strongly associated with behavioral and cognitive impairment. Olfactory testing may represent an early screening tool in order to identify ALS subjects with cognitive/behavioral dysfunction. Further studies in larger series are mandatory in order to better investigate clinical and pathological aspects in this group of patients.

27567887|a|BACKGROUND: Scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD), a heterogeneous disorder, refers to patients with normal dopamine transporter scan presumed to have Parkinson's disease (PD). Although clinically hard to discriminate, it is important to differentiate SWEDD from PD in the early stage of disease in practice. Olfactory dysfunction is a sensitive biomarker of neurodegeneration. A considerable number of SWEDD patients show abnormal olfaction. We investigated the olfaction and non-motor symptoms in SWEDD, PD, and healthy controls. A subgroup analysis of SWEDD by olfactory function was also conducted. METHODS: This study enrolled 40 SWEDD, 28 PD, and 26 healthy controls. The Korean version of Sniffin's stick test II (KVSS II) and the Korean version of non-motor symptoms scale for PD (K-NMSS) were used to evaluate olfaction and non-motor symptoms. Patients with SWEDD were categorized into normal olfaction (SWEDD-N) and olfactory dysfunction (SWEDD-D) subgroups. RESULTS: Overall KVSS II scores of SWEDD group was distinctive when compared to those of PD or controls. K-NMSS scores were increased in PD compared to those in SWEDD or controls. In subgroup analysis, KVSS II scores in SWEDD-D were similar to those in PD. K-NMSS scores in SWEDD-D were also significantly higher than those in SWEDD-N but lower than those in PD. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction could be a biomarker to differentiate SWEDD from PD. Non-motor symptoms differed between the two SWEDD subgroups classified by olfaction. These findings suggest that the underlying pathophysiology of SWEDD with normal olfaction and olfactory dysfunction might be different.

27703161|t|Intake of vitamin B before onset of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism and olfactory function at the time of diagnosis.
27703161|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether vitamin-B density in the diet 2-8 years before diagnosis is associated with olfactory function at the time of diagnosis. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This prospective nested case-control study included patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear paralysis identified between 2004 and 2009 in the county of Vasterbotten in northern Sweden. The case database (NYPUM study; Newly Diagnosed Parkinson in Umea; n=147) was cross-linked to the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS). Identified patients (n=96) and controls (n=375) were matched for sex, age, year of health survey, sub-cohort and geographical area. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire, and the brief smell identification test (B-SIT) was used to measure olfactory function at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: There was no difference in vitamin-B or any other macro- or micro-nutrient densities, energy intake or body mass index (kg/m2; BMI) between patients and controls at baseline at the time of the healthcare survey. A lower thiamin and folate density, amount per 1 megajoule, was reported in patients who scored below median on B-SIT (<7) when compared with that in patients who scored >=7 at the time of diagnosis. After adjusting for age, sex and BMI using linear and logistic regressions, an even stronger association was found between thiamin density and olfactory function. CONCLUSIONS: A low thiamin and folate density in the reported diet, 2-8 years before PD diagnosis, was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunction at the time of PD diagnosis.

28530322|t|[ORO-DENTO-FACIAL MANIFESTATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH FAMILIAL DYSAUTONOMIA].
28530322|a|INTRODUCTION: The oro-dento-facial features and dysfunctions of children with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III (HSAN III), known as familial dysautonomia (FD) or Riley-Day syndrome, were first described in the scientific literature in 1949. They include: dental trauma, dental and soft tissue selfmutilation, normal dental age, normal sequence and timing of eruption and exfoliation of teeth, smaller tooth size, different and disproportional tooth components, normal alveolar bone height, small jaws, mild crowding and malocclusion. These individuals have different craniofacial morphology from accepted norms, but resemble norms of their ethnic origin. The subjects often display gray, pale, shiny faces with an asymmetric suffering expression; frontal bossing, with eventual hypertelorism and narrow lips; a low dental caries rate; drooling, and genuine hypersalivation. They may have changes in salivary composition and content, which influence plaque and calculus accumulation and increase the risk of gingival and periodontal diseases. They also have difficulty in controlling oral muscles, a progressive decrease in the number of tongue fungiform papillae, accompanied by a reduced number of taste buds and specific dysgeusia, but a normal sense of smell.

28543731|t|Neuroimaging biomarkers and impaired olfaction in cognitively normal individuals.
28543731|a|OBJECTIVE: There is a need for inexpensive noninvasive tests to identify older healthy persons at risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) for enrollment in AD prevention trials. Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. METHODS: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (n = 829) to assess a composite AD signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and underwent 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (n = 306) and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (n = 305) positron emission tomography scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 829 CN participants (mean age = 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score < 6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope = -0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.76 to -0.09, p = 0.01 and slope = -0.72, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.28, p < 0.01, respectively). Reduced HVa, decreased AD signature cortical thickness, and increased amyloid accumulation were significantly associated with increased odds of anosmia. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that OI may be a noninvasive, inexpensive marker for risk stratification, for identifying participants at the preclinical stage of AD who may be at risk for cognitive impairment and eligible for inclusion in AD prevention clinical trials. These cross-sectional findings remain to be validated prospectively. Ann Neurol 2017;81:871-882.

28633628|t|Olfactory testing in consecutive patients referred with suspected dementia.
28633628|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and early and accurate diagnosis is important. Olfactory dysfunction is an early sign of AD. The contribution by test of olfactory function has been surveyed in AD vs a line of conditions but remains to be settled in the workup of unselected patients referred with suspected dementia. METHODS: We performed a two-step investigation: first, a comparative study of healthy controls and probable AD patients to test the applicability of the chosen scents (cuisine study); second, a study of consecutive patients referred to our geriatric outpatient clinic for suspected dementia with the investigating personnel blinded to the results of the Olfactory Test (blinded study). RESULTS: The sum of scents detected discriminated patients with probable AD from controls in the cuisine study (n = 40; p < 0.001; area under ROC curve 0.94). In the blinded study (n = 50) the diagnosis was probable AD in 48%, minimal cognitive impairment in 24%, vascular dementia in 8%, alcohol induced impairment in 12%, depression in 4%, and Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia in 2%. Area under the ROC-curve was 0.67. The odds ratio for probable AD with 2+ smell errors was 12 (95%-CI: 1.3-101; p = 0.026 (reference 0-1 smell errors)) age adjusted. None in the AD group had zero smell errors (Negative Predictive Value 100%). CONCLUSION: Olfactory testing may support to dismiss the diagnosis of probable AD in the workup of a mixed group of patients referred with cognitive impairment. Still, it had a low sensitivity for probable AD.

28643854|t|Olfactory dysfunction in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: Morphological evaluations from the nose to the brain.
28643854|a|Olfactory dysfunction is among the signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. It has been demonstrated Abeta was associated with olfactory impairment observed in both transgenic mice and in AD patients. In this study, we evaluated amyloid deposition in the olfactory circuit of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD, which showed olfactory dysfunction in olfactory behavior tests. We found amyloid depositions were widely distributed in the whole olfactory circuit. Moreover, we think these amyloid depositions contribute to neuronal atrophy, dendritic abnormalities, synapse loss and axonal degeneration. Therefore, there was a correlation between olfactory deficits and amyloid deposition. Our findings provide initial insights into the pathological basis of AD-related olfactory dysfunction.

28653210|t|Lateralized microstructural changes in early-stage Parkinson's disease in anterior olfactory structures, but not in substantia nigra.
28653210|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by motor symptoms as well as severe deficits in olfactory function and microstructural changes in olfactory brain regions. Because of the evidence of asymmetric neuropathological features in early-stage PD, we examined whether lateralized microstructural changes occur in olfactory brain regions and the substantia nigra in a group of early-stage PD patients. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), we assessed 24 early-stage PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 or 2) and 26 healthy controls (HC). We used DTI and a region of interest (ROI) approach to study the microstructure of the left and right anterior olfactory structures (AOS; comprising the olfactory bulbs and anterior end of the olfactory tracts) and the substantia nigra (SN). PD patients had reduced UPSIT scores relative to HC and showed increased mean diffusivity (MD) in the SN, with no lateralized differences. Significant group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and MD were seen in the AOS, but these differences were restricted to the right side and were not associated with the primary side of motor symptoms amongst PD patients. No associations were observed between lateralized motor impairment and lateralized microstructural changes in AOS. Impaired olfaction and microstructural changes in AOS are useful for early identification of PD but asymmetries in AOS microstructure seem unrelated to the laterality of PD motor symptoms.

28770710|t|Olfactory dysfunction and autoimmunity: pathogenesis and new insights.
28770710|a|Olfaction plays an important role in the perception of our environment. Smell impairment is known to be a manifestation of several autoimmune diseases. Similarities between the olfactory and immune systems and previously published human studies and animal models of autoimmune diseases account for the accumulating evidence for this observation. In this review, we will present the current literature concerning olfactory dysfunction in autoimmune diseases, discuss clinical aspects and provide new insights regarding pathogenesis and possible mechanisms.

29529530|t|Olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.
29529530|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common chronic neurological disease that causes disability. MS can have various clinical manifestations, one of which is olfactory dysfunction. In clinical practice, olfactory disturbances are usually underdiagnosed. The aim of our study is to assess olfactory function and its relationship with MS disease duration, disability and cognition. METHOD: We assessed 31 MS patients and 24 healthy controls matched in sex and age at our MS outpatient clinic of the Istanbul Education and Research Hospital Neurology Department. Each subject was interviewed to obtain demographic data. The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) were applied to each participant. RESULTS: The CCCRC test scores of the MS patients were lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Patients with a longer disease duration and more frequent attacks had lower CCCRC scores (p < 0.05). The Expanded Disability Status Scale scores had no correlation with the CCCRC test scores. The MOCA score was positively correlated with all domains of the olfactory test scores. CONCLUSION: This study supports the presence of olfactory dysfunction in early stages of MS and the correlation of cognitive impairment with olfactory dysfunction, even in the early stages of the disease in young and less physically- disabled patients. The assessment of olfaction may be helpful as a surrogate method for tracking disease progression in patients over time.

29726318|t|The use of olfactory testing when diagnosing Parkinson's disease - a systematic review.
29726318|a|INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically based on the presence of motor symptoms, but in the early phase of the disease, the diagnostic process can be challenging. Examination of non-motor symptoms in patients suspected of PD has gained growing attention. Olfactory tests have shown promising results as ancillary diagnostic tests. The aim of this study was to investigate how olfactory tests may be used clinically in diagnostic process in PD. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed for relevant literature on 8 March 2017. A total of 358 articles were found. Our screening process left 27 articles, which were included for further analysis. RESULTS: In all, 20 of the included studies analysed the diagnostic value of olfactory testing by comparing patients with PD to healthy controls. Sensitivities varied from 61% to 95% and specificities from 66% to 99%. Ten studies used olfactory tests to distinguish between PD and diseases that mimic PD. The sensitivities varied from 62% to 92% and the specificities from 65% and 96%. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory test can be a valuable ancillary tool in the diagnostic process in PD. In a clinical setting, the identification part from Sniffin' Sticks 16 is the most usable because it may be conducted quickly and independently of disease duration and severity. Before using an olfactory test in a clinical setting, it is necessary to adjust the odours to the patient population, and to establish the optimal specificity-adjusted cut-off.

30030773|t|Comparative Motor Pre-clinical Assessment in Parkinson's Disease Using Supervised Machine Learning Approaches.
30030773|a|Millions of people worldwide are affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), which significantly worsens their quality of life. Currently, the diagnosis is based on assessment of motor symptoms, but interest toward non-motor symptoms is increasing, as well. Among them, idiopathic hyposmia (IH) is associated with an increased risk of developing PD in healthy adults. In this work, a wearable inertial device, named SensFoot V2, was used to acquire motor data from 30 healthy subjects, 30 people with IH, and 30 PD patients while performing tasks from the MDS-UPDRS III for lower limb assessment. The most significant and non-correlated extracted parameters were selected in a feature array that can identify differences between the three groups of people. A comparative classification analysis was performed by applying three supervised machine learning algorithms. The system resulted able to distinguish between healthy and patients (specificity and recall equal to 0.967), and the people with IH can be identified as a separate class within a three-group classification (accuracy equal to 0.78). Thus, the system could support the clinician in objective assessment of PD. Further, identification of IH together with changes in motor parameters could be a non-invasive two-step approach to investigate the early onset of PD.

30386933|t|Association of olfaction dysfunction with brain microstructure in prodromal Parkinson disease.
30386933|a|OBJECTIVE: Although olfaction dysfunction is now considered as an established clinical marker of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD), little is known about the neural underpinnings of olfaction dysfunction in the prodromal phase of PD. The aim of this study was to examine the microstructural association of olfaction in prodromal PD compared to early stage drug-naive PD patients. METHODS: Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted on 18 early PD and 17 prodromal PD patients to investigate the differences in group in terms of altered connectivity, i.e., integrity of white matter tracts, and subsequently to study the correlation of University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score to white matter integrity in each group using a multiple regression model considering age, sex, RBD, and MoCA, as covariates. RESULTS: Individuals with prodromal PD had significantly higher quantitative anisotropy (QA) comparing with PD patients in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and right arcuate fasciculus. Multiple regression analysis in prodromal PD demonstrated positive association between UPSIT score and connectivity in left and right subgenual cingulum, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, left corticospinal tract, left parietopontine, left corticothalamic tract, and the body and the splenium of corpus callosum. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that PD and prodromal PD patients, which were matched for sex, UPSIT, and MoCA scores, have different white matter fiber architecture. Thus, it is postulated that olfaction dysfunction in prodromal and early clinical phases of PD may involve distinct pathogenesis. Increased network connectivity in prodromal and early PD may suggest the neural compensation.

31555978|t|Sex-related differences in olfactory function and evaluation of possible confounding factors among patients with Parkinson's disease.
31555978|a|The role of specific sex-related patterns in olfactory dysfunctions of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of specific sex-related patterns in olfactory dysfunctions excluding the possibility of confounding effects in patients with Parkinson's disease. One hundred and sixty-eight participants (99 PD patients and 69 controls) were enrolled and evaluated using Sniffin' Sticks Extended test (SSET). There was no significant sex difference in the control group for the SSET parameters. By contrast, in the PD group male patients scored significantly lower on odor discrimination (OD), identification (OI), and Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score than females. On multivariable linear regression analysis, the only significant predictors of TDI score were sex and apathy. Among PD patients, men showed a significantly greater impairment compared to women in OI, OD and TDI score, but not in odor threshold (OT). These findings highlighted the possible role of sex differences in the development of associated PD non-motor symptoms.

31676234|t|Intact global cognitive and olfactory ability predicts lack of transition to dementia.
31676234|a|INTRODUCTION: Odor identification deficits characterize Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. We examined if intact performance on brief cognitive and odor identification tests predicts lack of transition to dementia. METHODS: In an urban community, 1037 older adults without dementia completed the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, which includes the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT). Data from 749 participants followed up for 4 years were analyzed. RESULTS: In covariate-adjusted survival analyses, impairment on the Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration Test and B-SIT each predicted dementia (n = 109), primarily Alzheimer's disease (n = 101). Among participants with intact olfactory (B-SIT >= 11/12 correct) and cognitive (Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration Test <= 5/28 incorrect) ability, 3.4% (4/117) transitioned to dementia during follow-up with no transitions in the 70-75 and 81-83 years age group quartiles. DISCUSSION: Odor identification testing adds value to global cognitive testing, and together can identify individuals who rarely transition to dementia, thereby avoiding unnecessary diagnostic investigation.

32232807|t|[Olfactory Dysfunctions: References to Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Diagnostics].
32232807|a|Past research has revealed a variety of olfactory deficits associated with psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. These deficits are evident in psychophysical olfactory testing as well as neurophysiological and neuroanatomical examinations. The specific type of olfactory dysfunction appears disorder specific. For example, with regard to affective disorders, the functional and anatomical overlap between olfactory and emotion-specific brain areas has been suggested as a major underlying factor for olfactory dysfunction. Based on converging evidence of changes in olfactory perception related to Major Depression, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease, olfactory testing has been discussed as an important additional diagnostic marker. Hence, valid methods for objective and reliable olfactory testing as well as guidelines for the interpretation of the respective diagnostic findings are required. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of reported olfactory deficits in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, a selection of olfactory tests, available in German-speaking countries, with regard to the respective disorder-related olfactory deficit in question are presented and classified. Original data regarding an empirical validation of the Dusseldorf Odour Discrimination Test in a clinical population are presented.

32741361|t|Increased prediction value of biomarker combinations for the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia.
32741361|a|BACKGROUND: Progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia can be predicted by clinical features and a combination of biomarkers may increase the predictive power. In the present study, we investigated whether the combination of olfactory function and plasma neuronal-derived exosome (NDE) Abeta1-42 can best predict progression to AD dementia. METHODS: 87 MCI patients were enrolled and received the cognitive assessment at 2-year and 3-year follow-up to reevaluate cognition. In the meanwhile, 80 healthy controls and 88 AD dementia patients were enrolled at baseline as well to evaluate the diagnose value in cross-section. Olfactory function was evaluated with the sniffin sticks (SS-16) and Abeta1-42 levels in NDEs were determined by ELISA. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the risk factors for cognitive decline in MCI at 2-year and 3-year revisits. RESULTS: In the cross cohort, lower SS-16 scores and higher Abeta1-42 levels in NDEs were found in MCI and AD dementia compared to healthy controls. For the longitudinal set, 8 MCI individuals developed AD dementia within 2 years, and 16 MCI individuals developed AD dementia within 3 years. The two parameter-combination of SS-16 scores and Abeta1-42 level in NDEs showed better prediction in the conversion of MCI to AD dementia at 2-year and 3-year revisit. Moreover, after a 3-year follow-up, SS-16 scores also significantly predicted the conversion to AD dementia, where lower scores were associated with a 10-fold increased risk of developing AD dementia (p = 0.006). Similarly, higher Abeta1-42 levels in NDEs in patients with MCI increased the risk of developing AD dementia by 8.5-fold (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: A combination of two biomarkers of NDEs (Abeta1-42) and SS-16 predicted the conversion of MCI to AD dementia more accurately in combination. These findings have critical implications for understanding the pathophysiology of AD dementia and for developing preventative treatments for cognitive decline.

32830809|t|Nasal chemosensory tests: biomarker between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia.
32830809|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) are progressive and disabling neurodegenerative disorders, which are often misdiagnosed due to theirs overlapping clinical and paraclinical features. Nevertheless, their adequate management requires an accurate differential diagnosis. The main aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of olfactory and trigeminal nasal testing for the differential diagnosis between DLB and PDD. METHODS: Odor thresholds to three odorants differentially activating the olfactory and trigeminal systems were assessed in patients with DLB, PDD and healthy controls (n = 20 per group). RESULTS: Odor thresholds were significantly different between the three groups of subjects. More precisely, we found that DLB patients had significantly lower detection threshold performances compared to PDD patients. Moreover, using a standard canonical discriminant analysis, we confirmed a plain differentiation between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights that DLB patients have very poor olfactory and trigeminal detection threshold performances, which are significantly lower, compared to PDD patients. These results suggest that olfactory testing, using odorants that stimulate both the olfactory and trigeminal systems, could constitute an interesting biomarker and contribute to the differential diagnosis of PDD and DLB patients. Further researches, notably on olfacto-trigeminal interactions, are warranted in these populations to support our findings.

32978117|t|Olfactory impairment and the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults: a meta-analysis.
32978117|a|INTRODUCTION: The prediction of the impact of olfactory impairment on cognitive decline in older adults has been different among different age groups. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis sought to estimate the predictive power of olfactory impairment on cognitive decline during follow-up in older adults of different ages. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A medical literature search was carried out using these databases for eligible studies: MEDLINE, COCHRANE and EMBASE. Studies recording olfaction and cognition detection at the beginning and end of the follow-up were included in the preliminary screening. The medical records of older adults without cognitive impairment at the beginning of the follow-up were taken into account in this analysis. Raw data was extracted in order to estimate the relative risk and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Subgroup analysis of age was performed to eliminate the effect of age on the results. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the I2 index and Cochran's Q test. RESULTS: Eight studies were enrolled in this analysis (3237 events and 13165 participants), and the pooled relative risk for the 70-80 years old subgroup was 2.00 (95% CI=1.79-2.23). CONCLUSION: Relatively, there is a higher risk of cognitive impairment at the end of follow-up in younger adults with olfactory impairment at the beginning of follow-up. The length of follow-up has a little effect on the relative risk.

33078369|t|Neurobiochemical Cross-talk Between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's Disease.
33078369|a|COVID-19, the global threat to humanity, shares etiological cofactors with multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the common links between COVID-19 and AD would harness strategizing therapeutic approaches against both. Considering the urgency of formulating COVID-19 medication, its AD association and manifestations have been reviewed here, putting emphasis on memory and learning disruption. COVID-19 and AD share common links with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), galectin-9 (GAL-9 or Gal-9), and APOE4 allele. Common etiological factors and common manifestations described in this review would aid in developing therapeutic strategies for both COVID-19 and AD and thus impact on eradicating the ongoing global threat. Thus, people suffering from COVID-19 or who have come round of it as well as people at risk of developing AD or already suffering from AD, would be benefitted.

33436502|t|Olfactory impairment as an early marker of Parkinson's disease in REM sleep behaviour disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
33436502|a|Olfactory impairment and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) are prodromal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that may be associated with each other. This review aims to investigate the significance of olfaction in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with RBD and to assess moderating factors affecting olfactory performance. We searched articles on olfaction in RBD and PD in five electronic databases. We identified 32 studies for the systematic review and used 28 of those, including 2858 participants for meta-analysis. Results revealed significant deficits in odour identification (g=-1.80; 95% CI: -2.17 to -1.43), threshold (g=-1.29; 95% CI: -1.67 to -0.91), discrimination (g=-1.08; 95% CI: -1.28 to -0.87) and overall olfactory function (g=-1.64; 95% CI: -1.94 to -1.35) in patients with RBD. Except for the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores, none of the known moderating variables (including age, sex, disease duration and years of education) accounted for the olfactory function heterogeneity in patients with RBD. We identified similar olfactory impairments in patients with RBD and patients with PD (either with or without underlying RBD). These findings suggest that olfactory impairment may be a sensitive and stable diagnostic biomarker of RBD and appears to be useful for identifying patients with idiopathic RBD at high risk for early conversion to PD.

33631765|t|Surveillance Study of Acute Neurological Manifestations among 439 Egyptian Patients with COVID-19 in Assiut and Aswan University Hospitals.
33631765|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can be accompanied by acute neurological complications of both central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS). In this study, we estimate the frequency of such complications among hospital inpatients with COVID-19 in Assiut and Aswan university hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened all patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted from 1 June to 10 August 2020 to the university hospitals of Assiut and Aswan in Upper Egypt. Clinical and laboratory tests, CT/MRI of the chest and brain, and neurophysiology study were performed for each patient if indicated. RESULTS: 439 patients had confirmed/probable COVID-19; neurological manifestations occurred in 222. Of these, 117 had acute neurological disease and the remainder had nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms such as headache, vertigo, and depression. The CNS was affected in 75 patients: 55 had stroke and the others had convulsions (5), encephalitis (6), hypoxic encephalopathy (4), cord myelopathy (2), relapse of multiple sclerosis (2), and meningoencephalitis (1). The PNS was affected in 42 patients: the majority had anosmia and ageusia (31) and the others had Guillain-Barre syndrome (4), peripheral neuropathy (3), myasthenia gravis (MG, 2), or myositis (2). Fever, respiratory symptoms, and headache were the most common general symptoms. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease were the most common comorbidities in patients with CNS affection. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19, both the CNS and PNS are affected. Stroke was the most common complication for CNS, and anosmia and/or ageusia were common for PNS diseases. However, there were 6 cases of encephalitis, 2 cases of spinal cord myelopathy, 2 cases of MG, and 2 cases of myositis.

34145553|t|Recent advances in the pathology of prodromal non-motor symptoms olfactory deficit and depression in Parkinson's disease: clues to early diagnosis and effective treatment.
34145553|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement dysfunction due to selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Non-motor symptoms of PD (e.g., sensory dysfunction, sleep disturbance, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms) precede motor symptoms, appear at all stages, and impact the quality of life, but they frequently go unrecognized and remain untreated. Even when identified, traditional dopamine replacement therapies have little effect. We discuss here the pathology of two PD-associated non-motor symptoms: olfactory dysfunction and depression. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms in PD and predates the onset of motor symptoms. It is accompanied by early deposition of Lewy pathology and neurotransmitter alterations. Because of the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and an increased risk of progression to PD, olfactory testing can potentially be a specific diagnostic marker of PD in the prodromal stage. Depression is a prevalent PD-associated symptom and is often associated with reduced quality of life. Although the pathophysiology of depression in PD is unclear, studies suggest a causal relationship with abnormal neurotransmission and abnormal adult neurogenesis. Here, we summarize recent progress in the pathology of the non-motor symptoms of PD, aiming to provide better guidance for its effective management.

34491308|t|ODor-evoked Autobiographical Memory in Alzheimer's disease?
34491308|a|OBJECTIVE: Because memory decline is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an important endeavor for both clinicians and researchers is to improve memory performances in AD. This can be pursued by olfactory stimulation of memory in patients with AD and by studying the effects of olfactory stimulation on autobiographical memory (i.e., memory for personal information). The effects of olfactory stimulation on autobiographical memory in patients with mild AD have been reported by recent research. We thus provide the first comprehensive overview of research on odor-evoked autobiographical memory in AD. We also establish the basis for solid theoretical analysis concerning the memory improvement reported by research on odor-evoked autobiographical memory in AD. METHOD: We examined literature on odor-evoked autobiographical memories in AD and propose the "OdAMA" (Odor-evoked Autobiographical Memory in Alzheimer's disease) model. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: According to OdAMA model, odor exposure activates involuntary access to specific autobiographical memories, which promotes enhanced experience subjective of retrieval in patients with AD and improves their ability to construct not only recent and remote events but also future ones. The OdAMA model could serve as a guide for researchers and clinicians interested in odor-evoked autobiographical memory in AD.

34951364|t|Olfactory Function, Genetic Predisposition, and Cognitive Performance in Chinese Adults.
34951364|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the association of olfactory function and genetic predisposition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with cognitive performance in adults. METHODS: A total of 2049 Chinese adults from Rugao Longevity and Ageing Study (RuLAS, n=1460, mean age 78 years) and Central China Cohort (CCC, n=589, mean age 48 years) were included in this study. A standard interview-based survey, clinical information, and blood samples were collected in both cohorts. Olfactory function in terms of olfactory identification was measured by the brief version of the Chinese Smell Identification Test consisted of 18 full points. Cognitive performance was measured by the Chinese version of the Mini-mental State Examination. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated from 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which were robustly related to Alzheimer's disease in Caucasians and cognitive performance in our Chinese population. RESULTS: In the pooled analyses, participants at the lowest quartile of olfactory function had significantly higher odds of cognitive impairment (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] =1.45 [1.00 to 2.09], Ptrend =0.005), and such association was stronger among participants with a stronger genetic predisposition of Alzheimer's disease (beta coefficient+-SE, -0.06+-0.03 in participants with a lower GRS vs. -0.19+-0.05 in those with a higher GRS, respectively, Pinteraction=0.01). Similar associations were observed in RuLAS (P-trend=0.06) and in CCC (P-trend<0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, a decreased olfactory function was associated with worse cognitive performance in adults, especially among participants with a higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the causal relationship between olfaction and cognitive performance.

36137975|t|Cognitive impairment is correlated with olfactory identification deficits in older Japanese adults: A cross-sectional study using objective and subjective olfactory measures.
36137975|a|AIM: Olfactory impairment is associated with cognitive impairment. However, differences between subjective and objective olfactory impairment measurements in older adults and their relationship with cognitive impairment are unclear. METHODS: We assessed the relationship between cognitive and olfactory impairments via a single-center observational study in 2020. Forty-seven individuals who visited our memory clinic were enrolled and asked to complete objective and subjective olfactory tests. Participants had dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. We administered the Open Essence (a simple card-type odor identification test) and self-administered odor questionnaire to assess objective and subjective olfaction, respectively, and the Mini-Mental State Examination to assess cognitive function. RESULTS: Older age was related to decreased Open Essence scores (P < 0.001). Compared with the mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition groups, the dementia group had significantly lower Open Essence scores (P < 0.001). Cognitive impairment was also associated with decreased Open Essence scores after adjusting for age, sex, and education (P < 0.001). Participants with dementia did not obtain lower self-administered odor questionnaire scores than those with normal cognition, and they tended to be unaware of their olfactory impairment. CONCLUSION: Open Essence scores significantly decreased according to the degree of cognitive impairment. Participants with dementia were unaware of their olfactory impairment, as indicated by odor questionnaire scores. Objective and subjective scores of olfaction differed in participants with dementia. Concomitant assessment of objective and subjective olfaction is useful to screen older adults with both olfactory and cognitive impairments. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 924-929.

36798000|t|Enhancement of taste by retronasal odors in patients with Wolfram syndrome and decreased olfactory function.
36798000|a|Wolfram syndrome is a rare disease characterized by diabetes, neurodegeneration, loss of vision, and audition. We recently found, in a young sample of participants (mean age 15 years), that Wolfram syndrome was associated with impairment in smell identification with normal smell sensitivity and whole-mouth taste function. However, these senses were assessed separately, and it is unknown whether smell-taste interactions are altered in Wolfram syndrome, which was the focus of this study. Participants with Wolfram syndrome (n = 36; 18.2 +- 6.8 years) and sex-age-equivalent healthy controls (n = 34) were assessed with a battery of sensory tests. Using sip-and-spit methods, participants tasted solutions containing gustatory and olfactory stimuli (sucrose with strawberry extract, citric acid with lemon extract, sodium chloride in vegetable broth, and coffee) with and without nose clips, and rated perceived taste and retronasal smell intensities using the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale. Participants also completed n-butanol detection thresholds and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Retronasal smell increased taste intensity of sucrose, sodium chloride, and coffee solutions similarly in both groups (P values <0.03). Compared with the control group, participants in the Wolfram group had lower UPSIT scores and reduced smell sensitivity, retronasal intensity, and saltiness (P values <0.03), but rated other taste intensities similarly when wearing the nose clip. Despite impairments in orthonasal smell identification, odor-induced taste enhancement was preserved in participants with Wolfram syndrome who still had some peripheral olfactory function. This finding suggests that odor-induced taste enhancement may be preserved in the presence of reduced olfactory intensity.

37084121|t|Could olfactory identification be a prognostic factor in detecting cognitive impairment risk in the elderly?
37084121|a|Aging contributes to the deterioration of the olfactory system in humans. Several studies indicate that the olfactory identification test alone may function as a screening test for olfactory dysfunction and they are more feasible to apply in clinical practice. Olfactory identification may be a predictor for cognitive impairment. Multiple studies have considered the use of odor identification as a measure to identify the conversion from normality to mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The objectives were (i) to elucidate the associations between cognitive status and olfactory identification performance in aging; (ii) understand the predictive value of olfactory capacity in identifying subjects with cognitive impairment risk; and (iii) to study how cognitive status and olfactory identification relate with other variables of wellness in aging, such as functional capabilities and clinical measures. For this purpose, a group of 149 participants (77.15 +- 7.29 years; 73 women of 76.7 +- 8 years and 76 men of 77.6 +- 6.52 years) were recruited and were subjected to a sociodemographic questionnaire, a psychological screening tool of general cognitive status, an olfactory identification evaluation, and clinical measures. The participants were divided into groups based on their cutoff scores of previous scientific reports about the Spanish version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Our results indicate an age-associated decline in olfactory identification ability and intensity of odor perception. The predictive ability of olfactory identification scores for the risk of mild and severe impairment is around 80%. Olfactory identification decreases with cognitive function. Performance in odor identification is associated with impairment of episodic memory and executive functions. These findings further our current understanding of the association between cognition and olfaction, and support olfactory assessment in screening those at higher risk of dementia.

37651040|t|Olfactory status in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders.
37651040|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction has been suggested as a diagnostic and discriminative biomarker in some neurodegenerative disorders. However, there are few studies regarding the olfactory status in rare diseases including neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) disorders. METHODS: Genetically-confirmed NBIA patients were enrolled. Neurological and cognitive examinations were conducted according to the Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration-Disease Rating Scale (PKAN-DRS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire, respectively. Olfaction was assessed in three domains of odor threshold (OT), odor discrimination (OD), odor identification (OI), and total sum (TDI) score by the Sniffin' Sticks test. The olfactory scores were compared to a control group and a normative data set. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients, including 22 PKAN, 6 Kufor Rakeb syndrome, 4 Mitochondrial membrane Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (MPAN), 5 cases of other 4 subtypes, and 37 controls were enrolled. The mean PKAN-DRS score was 51.83+-24.93. Sixteen patients (55.2%) had normal cognition based on MMSE. NBIA patients had significantly lower olfactory scores compared to the controls in TDI and all three subtests, and 60% of them were hyposmic according to the normative data. Including only the cognitively-normal patients, still, OI and TDI scores were significantly lower compared to the controls. The phospholipase A2-Associated Neurodegeneration (PLAN) and MPAN patients had a significantly lower OI score compared to the cognitively-matched PKAN patients. CONCLUSION: Olfactory impairment as a common finding in various subtypes of NBIA disorder can potentially be considered a discriminative biomarker. Better OI in PKAN compared to PLAN and MPAN patients may be related to the different underlying pathologies.

38016198|t|Multimodal spatiotemporal monitoring of basal stem cell-derived organoids reveals progression of olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
38016198|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a highly prevalent symptom and an early sign of neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, the roles of peripheral olfactory system in disease progression and the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration remain to be studied. Olfactory epithelium (OE) organoid is an ideal model to study pathophysiology in vitro, yet the reliance on 3D culture condition limits continual in situ monitoring of organoid development. Here, we combined impedance biosensors and live imaging for real-time spatiotemporal analysis of OE organoids morphological and physiological features during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The impedance measurements showed that organoids generated from basal stem cells of APP/PS1 transgenic mice had lower proliferation rate than that from wild-type mice. In concert with the biosensor measurements, live imaging enabled to visualize the spatial and temporal dynamics of organoid morphology. Abnormal protein aggregation and accumulation, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, was found in AD organoids and increased as disease progressed. This multimodal in situ bioelectrical measurement and imaging provide a new platform for investigating onset mechanisms of OD, which would shed new light on early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

38016361|t|Which factors affect phenoconversion in isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder?
38016361|a|AIM: Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) is characterized by loss of the normal atonia of REM sleep. Patients with IRBD are at substantial risk of developing the synuclein-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Few predictors of phenoconversion (from IRBD to NDD) have been identified such as age >65 years, hyposmia, constipation, elevated Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). We aimed to detect rate and risk factors of phenoconversion. METHOD: The study designed as retrospectively. NDD was developed in 18 (27.27%) patients while NDD wasn't developed in 48 (72.73%) patients after ten years. The data of the first visit (age, gender, hyposmia, constipation, ESS, comorbidities, physical/neurological examinations, laboratory, and polysomnography) were compared between NDD (n:18) and IRBD (46) groups. The statistical program IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20.0 was used for all analyzes. The threshold for statistical significance for each test was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Although, most first-visit data (age, gender, hyposmia, constipation, ESS, laboratory, polysomnography) were not different between NDD (n:18) and IRBD (n:48) groups, diabetes mellitus (DM) frequency (p:0.021), mean duration of DM (0.027), chest circumference (p:0.017), and hip circumference (p:0.045) were found higher in NDD than IRBD. If the risk of phenoconversion calculated by logistic regression analysis was different only in terms of DM frequency (p:0.030) [odds ratio: 4.909 (1.17-20.19)]. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the phenoconversion rate for ten years is 27.27%, and IRBD patients with diabetes mellitus increase the phenoconversion risk nearly five times.

38151574|t|Clinical features and neurobiochemical mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson disease.
38151574|a|This study aimed to investigate clinical features, influencing factors and neurobiochemical mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction (OD) in Parkinson disease (PD). Total 39 patients were divided into the PD with OD (PD-OD) and PD with no OD (PD-nOD) groups according to overall olfactory function, including threshold, discrimination and identification, assessed by Sniffin' Sticks test. Motor function and non-motor symptoms were rated by multiple scales. Dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured. We found that the PD-OD group showed significantly lower score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, higher scores of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) Screening Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale than the PD-nOD group (p < 0.05). RBD Screening Questionnaire score was independently associated with the scores of overall olfactory function and discrimination (p < 0.05). Dopamine and acetylcholine levels in CSF from the PD-OD group was significantly lower than that from the PD-nOD group (p < 0.05). Dopamine and acetylcholine levels in CSF were significantly and positively correlated with the scores of overall olfactory function, threshold, discrimination and identification in PD patients (p < 0.05). RBD Screening Questionnaire score was significantly and negatively correlated with acetylcholine level in CSF in PD patients with poor olfactory detection (p < 0.05). This investigation reveals that PD-OD is associated with cognitive impairment, probable RBD and excessive daytime sleepiness. PD-OD is correlated with the decreased levels of dopamine and acetylcholine in CSF. RBD is an independent influencing factor of overall olfactory function and discrimination, and the decreased acetylcholine level in CSF may be the common neurobiochemical basis of RBD and OD in PD patients.

38251465|t|Trajectories of olfactory identification preceding incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia: a longitudinal study.
38251465|a|BACKGROUND: The pattern of olfactory identification change in the early phases of dementing disorders is unclear. We aimed to assess olfactory identification trajectories preceding incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and explore the role of brain pathologies in these trajectories. METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 1318 dementia-free older adults were followed annually for up to 11 years. Olfactory identification was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test annually. Of 900 cognitively intact participants, incident MCI and dementia were diagnosed following standard criteria. Over follow-up, 518 participants died and underwent brain autopsies for neuropathological assessment. Data were analyzed using mixed-effect models with backward timescales. FINDINGS: Compared to participants who remained cognitively intact, olfactory identification declined faster among those who developed MCI (beta -0.09 [95% CI -0.13, -0.05]), leading to a significantly lower olfactory identification starting from five years preceding MCI diagnosis (mean difference at year -5: -0.39 [-0.71, -0.07]). Among participants with incident MCI, olfactory identification declined faster in those who developed dementia compared to those who did not (beta -0.19 [-0.36, -0.01]), leading to a significantly lower olfactory identification starting from three years preceding dementia diagnosis (mean difference at year -3: -0.95 [-1.67, -0.23]). A faster decline in olfactory identification was associated with higher burdens of global Alzheimer's disease pathology, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid beta load. INTERPRETATION: Olfactory identification declined faster preceding dementia disorders and Alzheimer's pathology may underlie these faster declines. FUNDING: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01AG17917) and Swedish Research Council (2021-01647).

38376048|t|A lack of drebrin causes olfactory impairment.
38376048|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory deficit often occurs during the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although olfactory deficit is a useful measure for screening AD-related amnestic disorder, little is known about the cause of this deficit. Human and animal studies indicate that loss of the actin binding protein, drebrin, is closely related to cognitive dysfunction in AD. We hypothesized that the olfactory deficit in AD is caused by the loss of drebrin from the spine. METHODS: To verify this hypothesis, we performed the buried food test in two types of drebrin knockout mice, such as drebrin-double (E and A) knockout (DXKO) mice, and drebrin A-specific knockout (DAKO) mice. RESULTS: The DXKO mice spent a significantly longer time to find food compared with the wild-type (WT) littermates. In contrast, the DAKO mice, in which drebrin E rather than drebrin A is expressed in the postsynaptic sites of mature neurons, spent an equivalent time trying to find food compared to that of the WT. The DXKO mice showed comparable food motivation and sensory functions other than olfaction, including visual and auditory functions. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that drebrin is necessary for normal olfactory function. Further study is needed to determine whether it is necessary for normal olfaction to express drebrin E during the developmental stage or to have drebrin (whether E or A) present after maturation.

38517805|t|Opportunities and Pitfalls of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and Olfactory Dysfunction as Early Markers in Parkinson's Disease.
38517805|a|During its pre-motor stage, Parkinson's disease (PD) presents itself with a multitude of non-motor symptoms with different degrees of specificity and sensitivity. The most important among them are REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and olfactory dysfunction. RBD is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of REM sleep muscle atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. Olfactory dysfunction in individuals with prodromal PD is usually described as hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) or anosmia (complete loss of olfactory function). These symptoms can precede the full expression of motor symptoms by decades. A close comprehension of these symptoms and the underlying mechanisms may enable early screening as well as interventions to improve patients' quality of life. Therefore, these symptoms have unmatched potential for identifying PD patients in prodromal stages, not only allowing early diagnosis but potentially opening a window for early, possibly disease-modifying intervention. However, they come with certain challenges. This review addresses some of the key opportunities and pitfalls of both RBD and olfactory dysfunction as early markers of PD.

1985296|t|Quantification of magnetic resonance scans for hippocampal and parahippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.
1985296|a|The brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) invariably exhibit neuropathology in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex when examined postmortem. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a noninvasive, high-resolution method for quantifying volumetric changes in the AD brain antemortem. Eight patients diagnosed with probable AD and 7 age-matched controls had MRI scans and were tested on a battery of cognitive and olfactory tests. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (parahippocampal gyrus) showed significant atrophy, with over 40% reduction in size. Areas of the brain that are not highly involved in the degenerative state of AD, such as the striatum, did not show significant volumetric changes. Hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus volumes had the highest correlation with scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (r = 0.89), with lower correlations for a smell identification test (r = 0.65), odor match-to-sample test (r = 0.72), and a visual match-to-sample test (r = 0.26).

3607528|t|Presence of both odor identification and detection deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
3607528|a|Recent studies of Alzheimer's disease patients have demonstrated (a) marked structural and biochemical alterations in brain regions associated with olfactory function (including the olfactory bulb and entorhinal cortex) and (b) decrements in the ability to identify odorants. In light of such findings, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and a forced-choice phenyl ethyl alcohol odor detection threshold test to a relatively large number of patients diagnosed, on the basis of stringent criteria, as having mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. Compared to age-, gender-, and race-matched normal controls, these individuals evidenced consistent and marked decrements on both types of olfactory tests (ps less than 0.001). Surprisingly few of the patients were aware of their disorder, despite its appearance early in the disease process. These findings indicate that both odor identification and odor detection problems are present in dementia of the Alzheimer's type, and raise the possibility that the odor identification problem may be secondary to the odor detection problem.

9929672|t|Odor memory in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.
9929672|a|The ability in normal elderly to verbally recall previously presented odors and to learn this task across trials was studied by applying a design which compared performance on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) with an analogous odor test. Results suggest that both immediate and delayed recall of odors, both free and cued, as well as the ability to learn across trials is impaired in normal aging, perhaps more so for olfaction than for audition, which can be referred to poor use of semantic-clustering strategies and poor identification. Olfactory decline in memory in normal aging is, however, far from as affected as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two studies of persons with questionable AD demonstrated significant deficits in both recognition memory and identification of odors. Although further research is required, the findings from these 'pre-clinical' cases imply that performance on olfactory-mediated tasks may contribute to early diagnosis of AD.

10067775|t|Odor identification in normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease: effects of retrieval support.
10067775|a|Odor sensitivity and identification were examined in normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aims were to investigate AD as associated with lower odor sensitivity, odor identification as a function of retrieval support, and the relationship between global cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Exam [MMSE]; M. F. Folstein, S. E. Folstein, & P. R. McHugh, 1975) and olfactory performance. Results indicated intact odor sensitivity but deficient odor identification in AD. Both groups benefited from cues in identification, and the size of the gains was equally large in AD patients and controls. The finding of no selective benefit from retrieval support in AD suggests that a degradation of olfactory knowledge contributes to the odor identification deficits in these patients. MMSE and identification were positively related, whereas MMSE and olfactory sensitivity were unrelated. These findings suggest that the AD-related olfactory impairment stems from lesions in cortical rather than peripheral structures.

11216885|t|Olfactory-evoked regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease.
11216885|a|Olfaction is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was hypothesized that AD would reduce olfactory-evoked perfusion in mesial temporal olfactory (piriform) cortex, where neuropathology begins. Seven AD patients and 8 elderly controls (ECs) underwent olfactory threshold and identification tests and olfactory stimulation during positron emission tomography. Odor identification was impaired in AD, but threshold was not. Olfactory stimulation in ECs activated right and left piriform areas and right anterior ventral temporal cortex. AD patients had less activation in right piriform and anterior ventral temporal cortex but not in the left piriform area. Although orbital cortex did not activate in ECs, there was a significant between-groups difference in this area. Right piriform activation correlated with odor identification. Impaired odor identification likely reflects sensory cortex dysfunction rather than cognitive impairment. Given olfactory bulb projections to the mesial temporal lobe, olfactory stimulation during functional imaging might detect early dysfunction in this region.

11259673|t|An impairment in sniffing contributes to the olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease.
11259673|a|Although the presence of an olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been recognized for 25 years, its cause remains unclear. Here we suggest a contributing factor to this impairment, namely, that PD impairs active sniffing of odorants. We tested 10 men and 10 women with clinically typical PD, and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, in four olfactory tasks: (i) the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test; (ii and iii) detection threshold tests for the odorants vanillin and propionic acid; and (iv) a two-alternative forced-choice detection paradigm during which sniff parameters (airflow peak rate, mean rate, volume, and duration) were recorded with a pneomatotachograph-coupled spirometer. An additional experiment tested the effect of intentionally increasing sniff vigor on olfactory performance in 20 additional patients. PD patients were significantly impaired in olfactory identification (P < 0.0001) and detection (P < 0.007). As predicted, PD patients were also significantly impaired at sniffing, demonstrating significantly reduced sniff airflow rate (P < 0.01) and volume (P < 0.002). Furthermore, a patient's ability to sniff predicted his or her performance on olfactory tasks, i.e., the more poorly patients sniffed, the worse their performance on olfaction tests (P < 0.009). Finally, increasing sniff vigor improved olfactory performance in those patients whose baseline performance had been poorest (P < 0.05). These findings implicate a sniffing impairment as a component of the olfactory impairment in PD and further depict sniffing as an important component of human olfaction.

12240739|t|Olfactory event-related potentials in Alzheimer's disease.
12240739|a|Areas of the brain affected in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease are also areas heavily involved in the processing of olfactory information. Olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs) and auditory ERPs were recorded from the Fz, Cz, and Pz electrode sites in 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 12 age and gender matched normal controls (NC) in a single-stimulus paradigm with a 45 s inter-trial interval, using amyl acetate as the olfactory stimulus, and in a separate session a 500 Hz tone as the auditory stimulus. Odor identification (ID) was also used to assess ability to identify odors. The results indicate that (1) OERP P2 and P3 latencies were significantly longer in AD patients than normal controls; (2) olfactory ERP latency measures correlated significantly with dementia status as measured by the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), indicating that as participants performed more poorly on the DRS, reflecting increased dementia, OERP latencies increased; (3) olfactory ERP latency measures better differentiated AD patients from normal controls than auditory ERP latency measures; (4) olfactory ERP measures alone correctly classified up to 92% of participants; (5) odor ID measures, namely the UPSIT and San Diego-Odor-ID tests also classified participants at a high rate. Combining scores for odor identification with olfactory P3 latency measures resulted in a correct classification rate of 100%. The results strongly support the use of olfactory measures in the assessment of AD.

12810790|t|Olfactory deficits and sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease: a case-control survey.
12810790|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory and sleep disturbances are common in Parkinson's disease, and may be early disease indicators. OBJECTIVE: To obtain information about olfactory and sleep deficits preceding the onset of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. SUBJECTS: 38 community dwelling patients with Parkinson's disease (73% response rate) and 32 age matched controls (60% response rate). METHODS: Using a questionnaire survey, the frequencies, timing, and relations between olfactory and sleep disturbances, drug treatment, mood, and motor deficits in Parkinson's disease were compared with those in age matched controls. Reliability of information was validated by informant interview in 9% of the sample. Interdependency of factors was assessed using Fisher's fourfold table test, and differences between populations were analysed using chi(2) and unpaired t tests. RESULTS: Microsmia was reported by 26 patients (68%) (and only one control), on average within a year of the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. More patients than controls had excessive daytime somnolence (45% v 6%), restless legs (50% v 19%), and abnormal movements during sleep (34% v 0%), which generally occurred three to five years after diagnosis and were independent of mood disorders and drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with Parkinson's disease have microsmia at the onset of motor deficits, but some sleep disorders are a subsequent occurrence.

12810892|t|"Do-it-yourself" dementia testing: issues regarding an Alzheimer's home screening test.
12810892|a|The Early Alert Alzheimer's Home Screening Test (AHST) is a variant of the Smell Identification Test (SIT) and the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT), and recently became available for purchase by the general public. The validity and the practical utility of routine screening for individuals with asymptomatic cognitive impairment has not been established. There are considerable specific methodological concerns regarding the use of the AHST including the association of olfactory impairment with (a) age in the absence of cognitive impairment, (b) numerous acute and/or chronic medical conditions, and (c) lifestyle habits and social and/or demographic variables. General public misunderstanding of the difference between a screening and a diagnostic test, primary care physicians' frequent confusion about follow-up mechanisms for newly diagnosed patients with dementia, the possible lack of perceived counseling options for those self-diagnosed, and abuse of test findings create distinct possibilities for misuse of this test.

15197709|t|A 100% increase of dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulb may explain hyposmia in Parkinson's disease.
15197709|a|Hyposmia is one of the most prevalent symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It may occur even before the motor symptoms start. To determine whether the olfactory dysfunctions, like the motor symptoms, are associated with a loss of dopamine, the number of dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulb of Parkinson's disease patients was studied using tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. The quantitative analysis reveals that the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the olfactory bulb is twice as high in Parkinson patients compared to age and gender-matched controls. Because dopamine is known to inhibit olfactory transmission in the olfactory glomeruli, we suggest that the increase of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb is responsible for the hyposmia in Parkinson patients. The increase of dopamine in the olfactory bulb explains why olfaction does not improve with levodopa therapy.

15290695|t|Smell identification test as an indicator for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
15290695|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess olfactory dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to compare utility of the olfactory tests as possible clinical markers. METHODS: Two olfactory identification tests (The Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test [CC-SIT] and the Picture-based Smell Identification Test [P-SIT]) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to patients with AD and age-matched controls. Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) genotypes of patients with AD were identified. RESULTS: Patients with AD had significantly lower olfactory identification scores than age-matched non-demented elderly subjects in both olfactory assessments. In the AD group, the coefficient of correlation between the MMSE scores and the P-SIT scores was higher than that between the MMSE scores and the CC-SIT scores. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses for both tests indicated that the P-SIT discriminated AD patients from controls more reliably than did the CC-SIT. Within AD patients, those who were carrying one or two ApoE epsilon4 alleles had a higher coefficient of correlation between the MMSE scores and the P-SIT scores than patients without the ApoE epsilon4 allele. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a short and simple non-lexical olfactory identification test can be useful as a clinical marker of AD appropriate for Japanese elderly population.

15580550|t|Challenging conventional wisdom: the etiologic role of dopamine oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease.
15580550|a|Oxidative stress is well documented in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been attributed to dopamine oxidative metabolism. However, evidence of oxidative stress is found in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that more general factors are responsible or that cytodestructive processes secondarily generate oxyradical products. Increasing evidence points away from dopamine metabolism as an important contributor to PD neurodegeneration. Predictions from the dopamine oxidative stress hypothesis of PD reveal multiple inconsistencies. Although the clinical and therapeutic importance of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is undeniable, PD neuropathology is much more widespread.

16769086|t|Taste in dementing diseases and parkinsonism.
16769086|a|Like with many sensory abilities a reduction of taste and smell occurs during aging. Since there are hints to an additional reduction in dementing diseases, we assessed 52 patients, 26 women and 26 men, who were presented to a memory clinic, using the Sniffin' Sticks, Whole Mouth and Taste Strip Tests. While smoking, alcohol consumption, intake of drugs and sex exerted only minor impact, age and the severity of cognitive impairment were of major importance. There was a moderate but significant correlation between the severity of dementia, taste and smell, even if the age effect was partialled out. Notably, patients with Parkinson syndrome showed worse taste and smell abilities than those without. Here the differences were indeed marked enough to play a possible role in making the diagnosis. This exploratory study confirms a mild reduction of gustatory function in dementing diseases over and beyond that of normal aging which--in addition to a reduction of smell--seems to be especially marked in Parkinson syndromes.

16822349|t|Preclinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: are we there yet?
16822349|a|Preclinical Parkinson's disease (PD) can be defined as a state that precedes the diagnosis of PD but without the presence of the characteristic motor features of the disorder. In such a situation, subtle non-motor features may be present or subclinical abnormalities may exist that can be detected only by physiologic testing. Alternatively, lifelong traits such as genetic mutations may predict the onset of PD in the absence of any clinical or physiologic abnormalities. A number of diagnostic technologies are currently available that can detect both preclinical states and traits that will lead to PD in the future. The current challenges are to refine these technologies and to determine how they should be employed so that their use is ethical, practical, and meaningful to at-risk individuals.

16944352|a|The clinical methods of olfactory testing and color discrimination as well as apparative methods such as transcranial ultrasound, dopamine transporter imaging and MIBG scintigraphy reveal a high sensitivity concerning the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). The specificity of the presented methods, in particular of the dopamine transporter imaging--seems to be limited. All these methods and primarily their combination allow the detection of PD in early and--probably--preclinical stages. This requires sufficient therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat preclinical and early PD.

17140156|t|Olfactory tau pathology in Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment.
17140156|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the occurrence of tau pathology in the olfactory system in aged subjects and its relation to the severity of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 273 autopsy cases (167 female, 106 male, aged 61-102, mean 83.2+/-4.5 SD years) underwent a standard neuropathological assessment with immuno-histochemical study of tau and Abeta amyloid in the olfactory bulb and nerve, and diagnosis of AD using established consensus criteria including Braak staging of neuritic AD pathology. RESULTS: All cases of definite AD (Braak stages 5 and 6, n = 96) showed large numbers of neuropil threads and neurofibrillary tangles, with amyloid deposits in 50%, and neuritic plaques only in two cases. Braak stage 4 (n = 73) was associated with tau pathology in the olfactory system in 90.4 and amyloid deposits in 9%, Braak stage 3 (n = 56) with mainly mild to moderate olfactory tau lesions in 44.6 and Abeta deposits in 9%. Braak stage 2 (n = 22) showed olfactory tau pathology in 36.4% without amyloid deposits, whereas Braak stages 0 and 1 (n = 25) were all negative. Olfactory tau pathology showed highly significant correlation with neuritic Braak staging in the brain, while both scores showed significant but low correlation with age. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm previous studies demonstrating considerable tau pathology in the olfactory system in all definite AD cases, in more than 2/3 of limbic AD and in more than 1/3 of elderly individuals with or without mild cognitive impairment associated with Braak stage 2. Clinical dementia correlated with both Braak and olfactory tau scores, indicating that both are associated with a high risk of cognitive decline.

17607095|t|Odor identification in Alzheimer's disease and depression.
17607095|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) olfactory deficits are common and depression is a difficult differential diagnosis. We therefore investigated the usefulness of an odor identification test to differentiate both conditions. METHODS: Twenty patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), twenty elderly patients with a depressive disorder, and thirty healthy elderly subjects performed a German odor identification test. RESULTS: AD patients had significantly lower odor identification scores, compared with both depressive patients and control subjects (F=121.96, df=2, 67, p<0.001). With a cut-off score of 10/11, the sensitivity of the identification test to differentiate AD patients from depressive patients was 100%, and specificity was 95%. CONCLUSIONS: The odor identification test used in this study is able to reveal olfactory deficits in AD. It also seems to be a useful instrument to differentiate AD from depression.

17701389|t|[Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: its role as a new cardinal sign in early and differential diagnosis].
17701389|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a prominent symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) and found in about 70-100% of patients. In earlier studies significant loss of olfactory function seemed to be unrelated to disease duration, did not correlate with motor function, and was uninfluenced by antiparkinsonian medication. We suggest that the increase of dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulb is responsible for the hyposmia in PD patients. Interestingly, this olfactory dysfunction is not found in progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration. In multiple system atrophy, the deficit is mild and indistinguishable from cerebellar syndromes of other aetiologies. Intact olfaction has also been reported recently in Parkin disease (PARK 2) and vascular parkinsonism. Olfactory tests may significantly enhance the diagnostic armamentarium in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes and indeterminate tremors. Furthermore, olfactory testing may also prove to be a useful aid in the early or "preclinical" detection of PD, once effective disease-modifying therapies are found. Braak and coworkers have confirmed the widespread, extranigral pathology in PD and suggested that pathology in the anterior olfactory region may be one of the earliest appearances of neurodegeneration in PD.

18074378|t|Rhinorrhea is increased in Parkinson's disease.
18074378|a|We have observed that rhinorrhea is increased in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) but only a single publication supports this. We performed two separate case control studies to assess the prevalence of rhinorrhea in PD in Rhode Island. One was cross-sectional and the other in consecutive de novo patients. We further questioned subjects as to whether rhinorrhea might be associated with olfactory impairment. We found that rhinorrhea affects about half of PD patients in Rhode Island, is an early feature, being present at the time of presentation, was significantly more common than in controls and was associated with self-perceived reduced olfaction. These observations confirm that rhinorrhea is a common problem and raise the questions as to whether some olfactory impairment found in PD could be confounded by rhinorrhea and also whether rhinorrhea may be a premotor symptom.

18090718|t|Sniffing out Parkinson disease: can olfactory testing differentiate parkinsonian disorders?
18090718|a|BACKGROUND: : Akinetic-rigid syndromes are a heterogeneous group of diseases with overlapping clinical manifestations. A recent American Academy of Neurology practice parameter indicated that olfactory testing was "probably useful" for differentiating idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) from other diseases with features of parkinsonism. OBJECTIVE: : To determine the diagnostic accuracy of olfactory testing for differentiating IPD from other parkinsonian disorders. METHODS: : The objective was addressed using a structured, evidence-based, critically appraised topic format. This format includes development of a clinical scenario, focused and answerable clinical question, search strategy, evidence appraisal, reporting and interpretation of results, commentary, and bottom line conclusions. Participants included neurology consultants and residents, clinical epidemiologists, a medical librarian, and neurologists with expertise in movement disorders. RESULTS: : Two studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of olfactory testing within a broad spectrum of parkinsonian syndromes. Each study examined different test methods [University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test; "Sniffin' Sticks"] and both were compromised by several potential biases in sampling and outcome evaluation. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test is moderately sensitive (77%; likelihood ratio 0.27) and specific (85%; likelihood ratio 4.9) for differentiation of IPD from non-IPD syndromes, but less specific (62%; likelihood ratio 2.0) for distinguishing IPD from multiple system atrophy. CONCLUSION: : The diagnostic accuracy of olfactory testing for differentiating IPD from other disorders is insufficient to justify its routine clinical use but available evidence is derived from small samples and studies of questionable validity. Recommendations for future research of olfactory testing for diagnosis and disease predication are discussed.

18097158|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
18097158|a|Prior to the onset of the cardinal motor features of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), other manifestations of neurodegeneration such as olfactory dysfunction are often apparent. Characterizing these potential biomarkers of preclinical PD is particularly important in identifying individuals who will go on to develop disabling symptoms, and thus be good candidates for new neuroprotective strategies. As shown by the Braak neuropathologic staging of PD, the olfactory system is among the first neuronal populations to display Lewy body pathology. Clinically, loss of smell can be easily tested in the office using several validated techniques and is often helpful to the physician in distinguishing idiopathic PD from other forms of parkinsonism. Recent findings have indicated that a decline in olfaction may be observed in selected at-risk patients, which has significant implications for identifying potential study populations. Ongoing studies of olfactory dysfunction may also reveal potential for use as a medication-independent biomarker of disease progression in addition to use as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD.

18353132|t|Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
18353132|a|Although still considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms. These include disorders of mood and affect with apathy, anhedonia and depression, cognitive dysfunction and hallucinosis, as well as complex behavioural disorders. Sensory dysfunction with hyposmia or pain is almost universal, as are disturbances of sleep-wake cycle regulation. Autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction and constipation is also present to some degree in a majority of patients. Whilst overall non-motor symptoms become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease, many of them can also antedate the first occurrence of motor signs - most notably depression, hyposmia or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). Although exact clinicopathological correlations for most of these non-motor features are still poorly understood, the occurrence of constipation, RBD or hyposmia prior to the onset of clinically overt motor dysfunction would appear consistent with the ascending hypothesis of PD pathology proposed by Braak and colleagues. Screening these early non-motor features might, therefore, be one approach towards early 'preclinical' diagnosis of PD. This review article provides an overview of the clinical spectrum of non-motor symptoms in PD together with a brief review of treatment options.

18451583|t|Dysgeusia limited to sweet taste in myasthenia gravis.
18451583|a|Total dysgeusia, an inability to interpret all of the basic tastes, often occurs with zinc deficiency. Partial dysgeusia (dissociation dysgeusia) is a rare inability to interpret a limited number of these basic tastes. We present the case of a patient with myasthenia gravis who became unable to discern sweet taste, but other basic tastes were unaffected. Such dysgeusia can be explained by obstruction of selective taste receptors in taste cells. We considered that this symptom was induced by an autoimmune mechanism related to myasthenia gravis.

18779429|t|Phantosmias and Parkinson disease.
18779429|a|BACKGROUND: Impaired olfaction is a common, nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, qualitative olfactory disturbances, such as odor distortions, have not been extensively reported in this condition. OBJECTIVE: To describe 2 patients who reported positive olfactory symptoms preceding typical PD, which were consistent with olfactory hallucinations (phantosmias) in the absence of major smell deficit. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University hospital. Patients We describe 2 patients, both seen in 2007, who reported pleasant olfactory hallucinations for several years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Iodine I 123-labeled ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography and olfactometric testing results. RESULTS: The (123)I-labeled ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography showed reduced radiotracer uptake in both striatum more marked in the putamen and on the left side in patient 1 and reduced radiotracer uptake in both putamen more marked on the right side in patient 2. Olfactometric testing showed mild hyposmia in patient 1 and normal function in patient 2. The disappearance of the phantosmias in both patients coincided with the development of typical PD. CONCLUSION: We propose phantosmia as a new premotor manifestation of PD and suggest that qualitative abnormalities of olfaction, rather than the typical smell loss demonstrated in this condition, should be more carefully examined in the prodromal phase of PD.

18809839|t|Hyposmia in G2019S LRRK2-related parkinsonism: clinical and pathologic data.
18809839|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in PARK8 (LRRK2) are associated with autosomal dominant parkinsonism and Parkinson disease (PD). Hyposmia is present in at least 80% of patients with PD and an accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is seen in the olfactory pathways. In this study we have clinically examined olfaction and pathologically examined the rhinencephalon in individuals carrying the G2019S LRRK2 mutation. METHODS: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Test (UPSIT) was used to evaluate the sense of smell in 19 parkinsonian and two asymptomatic carriers of the G2019S mutation and compared with groups of patients with PD and healthy controls. Postmortem examination of alpha-syn accumulation in the rhinencephalon was also carried out in four parkinsonian carriers of the G2019S mutation. RESULTS: The mean UPSIT score in G2019S parkinsonian carriers was lower than that in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and similar to that found in patients with PD (p > 0.999). Smell tests in two asymptomatic carriers of the G2019S mutation were in the normal range. Postmortem studies of the olfactory pathways in one of the patients who had been clinically tested, and found to have hyposmia, and three other cases with the G2019S mutation, revealed alpha-syn deposition in the olfactory pathways in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is diminished in LRRK2 G2019S mutation parkinsonism but the asymptomatic carriers of the mutation had normal olfaction. We found alpha-syn accumulation with Lewy bodies in the rhinencephalon in all four cases examined pathologically.

18855928|t|Extended testing across, not within, tasks raises diagnostic accuracy of smell testing in Parkinson's disease.
18855928|a|The aim of this study was to determine whether extended olfactory testing within a single olfactory task and/or across olfactory tasks increases diagnostic accuracy of olfactory testing in Parkinson's disease (PD). Olfactory function was assessed using an extended version of the "Sniffin' Sticks", comprising 32-item odor identification and discrimination tasks, and a detection threshold task in 52 PD patients and 50 controls, all aged between 49 and 78 years. ROC curves based on sensitivity and specificity estimates were used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of extended and combined olfactory testing. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the 16-item and the 32-item versions of the odor identification or discrimination test. The single olfactory test that was best in discriminating between PD patients and controls was a 16-item odor identification test. A combination of the 16-item identification test and the detection threshold task had a significantly higher area under the curve than the 16-item odor identification test alone. In conclusion, extended testing across, and not within, olfactory tasks increases diagnostic accuracy of olfactory testing in PD. A combination of an odor detection threshold task and a 16-item odor identification test had the highest sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between PD patients and controls.

19633944|t|Odor identification deficit as a predictor of five-year global cognitive change: interactive effects with age and ApoE-epsilon4.
19633944|a|Olfactory impairments are present in common neurodegenerative disorders and predict conversion to dementia in non-demented individuals with cognitive impairment. In cognitively intact elderly, evidence is sparse regarding the role of olfactory deficits in predicting cognitive impairment. The present study investigated predictors of 5-year prospective decline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in a large (n = 501), population-based sample of elderly (65-90 years) individuals. All participants were genotyped for the ApoE gene, assessed for health factors, and were non-demented at the baseline assessment. After partialling out the influences of demographic and health-factors at baseline and dementia at follow-up, poor odor identification ability in combination with older age and the ApoE-epsilon4 allele predicted larger prospective global cognitive decline. This effect could not be produced by a vocabulary test. In sum, the findings suggest that an olfactory deficit can dissociate between benign and malign global cognitive development in non-demented, very old epsilon4-carriers, who are at high risk of developing dementia.

19727902|t|Taste in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
19727902|a|In this prospective study we investigated the quantitative and qualitative taste function of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 29 healthy, elderly subjects, 29 MCI and 30 AD patients were tested using a validated taste test, the "taste strips". Additionally, odor identification, odor discrimination, odor threshold, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Apo E epsilon 4 status were examined. Regarding taste, there was a significant reduction of total taste scores and also the score for individual tastes on either side of the tongue between controls and MCI/AD patients. There was no significant difference in the taste scores between MCI and AD patients. A taste test may be a useful procedure for differentiating between healthy subjects and patients with MCI/AD in a clinical context. For diagnosing MCI versus AD, further tests such as smell test, MMSE, Apo E epsilon 4 status, FDG-PET and MRI appear to be useful.

20211105|t|Smell and preclinical Alzheimer disease: study of 29 patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment.
20211105|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the olfactory function in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and the relationship to the progression from aMCI to Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Cohort prospective study on aMCI patients at the first evaluation (T0) and at the 18-month follow-up (T1). SETTING: Alzheimer Unit of the University of L'Aquila, Italy. METHODS: Twenty-nine aMCI patients were enrolled in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Olfactory function was studied with the Sniffin' Sticks Screening Test (SSST) and the Sniffin' Sticks Extended Test (SSET). Olfactory functions were related to neurocognitive functions assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mental Deterioration Battery (MDB). RESULTS: At T0, aMCI patients showed an olfactory impairment and all of the aMCI patients had lower olfaction scores at T1. At T1, 9 of the 29 aMCI patients (31%) developed AD and had lower mean SSST and SSET scores than 20 aMCI patients who did not develop AD. The most significant relationship was found between olfactory discrimination and visuospatial ability, language skill, and the Rey Immediate test of the MDB and between olfactory identification and the Rey Delayed test. CONCLUSION: Odour discrimination and identification performance correlated more prominently than detection thresholds with performance on neuropsychological tests. We concluded that the olfactory deficit occurs early in aMCI, so we suggest introducing the clinical routine use of the olfactory test for early identification of the progression of the decline from aMCI to AD.

20625084|t|When does Parkinson disease start?
20625084|a|There is convincing evidence that the Parkinson disease neurodegenerative process begins many years before the onset of motor manifestations. Initial estimates based on nigral neuropathological findings or striatal dopamine imaging suggested a 5- to 6-year preclinical period. However, more recent evidence of Lewy body pathology in other neuronal populations preceding nigral involvement suggests that the preclinical phase may be much longer. Epidemiologic studies of nonmotor manifestations, such as constipation, anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and anemia, suggest that the preclinical period extends at least 20 years before the motor manifestations. Olfactory impairment and depression may also precede the onset of motor manifestations; however, the lag time may be shorter. Recognition of a nonmotor preclinical phase spanning 20 or more years should guide the search for predictive biomarkers and the identification of risk or protective factors for Parkinson disease.

20858529|t|The course of olfactory deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease--a study based on psychophysical and electrophysiological measures.
20858529|a|OBJECTIVES: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly show olfactory deficits in the early stages of the disease. These deficits can be verified psychophysically or electrophysiologically using olfactory event-related potentials (OERP). While psychophysical olfactory function in PD patients can improve over time, the course of OERPs in PD has not yet been investigated. METHODS: Olfactory function was investigated twice in 19 patients at 5-year intervals. Psychophysical tests included the "Sniffin' Sticks" test battery. In addition, OERPs were recorded in response to two odors on each side (phenyl-ethyl-alcohol: 40% (v/v), H(2)S, 6ppm). OERPs were evaluated regarding existence (yes/no). Average disease duration at follow-up was 9.0 years and the average Hoehn and Yahr score (disease stage) was 2.2. RESULTS: Psychophysically, 1 patient was normosmic, 14 were hyposmic, and 4 were functionally anosmic at the initial visit. Re-examination revealed 1 normosmic, 9 hyposmic, and 8 functionally anosmic patients. Mean olfactory function decreased significantly in all patients. OERPs were initially existent in 3 out of 19 patients. At follow-up, OERPs were no longer present in these patients, but were detectable in 3 other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, mean olfactory function decreased, although improvements were observed at the individual level. We confirmed previous findings regarding psychophysical follow-up results. Electrophysiological measures showed a pattern of fluctuation in olfactory function comparable to that of the psychophysical results. These fluctuations do not seem to predict the course of the disease.

21282592|t|A cross-sectional study contrasting olfactory function in autonomic disorders.
21282592|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare odor identification function in patients with peripheral or central autonomic neurodegeneration and in patients with intact autonomic neurons but undetectable norepinephrine. METHODS: Olfactory function was evaluated with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 12 patients with pure autonomic failure, 10 patients with multiple system atrophy, and 4 patients with dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency. Blood pressure and catecholamine data were also compared. RESULTS: Odor identification was significantly impaired in patients with pure autonomic failure relative to patients with multiple system atrophy or dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency. Out of 40 odors, the patients correctly identified mean (95% confidence interval) 19.2 (14.1 to 24.2), 34.4 (32.2 to 36.6), and 31.7 (29.4 to 34.1) (p < 0.001). The difference between patients with pure autonomic failure and those with multiple system atrophy or dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency persisted after adjustment for age (p = 0.001). Patients with pure autonomic failure also had a greater orthostatic fall in blood pressure and lower plasma norepinephrine levels than patients with multiple system atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory function was relatively intact in patients with dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, who have intact noradrenergic neurons but lack norepinephrine. Odor identification was impaired in pure autonomic failure but not in multiple system atrophy, suggesting that 1) peripheral noradrenergic innervation is important for olfactory identification but norepinephrine is not essential and 2) UPSIT may be useful in the differential diagnosis between these disorders.

21600591|t|View point: etiology in Parkinson's disease. Dual hit or spreading intoxication.
21600591|a|Parkinson's disease is not only a movement disorder: non-motor symptoms such as loss of smell, constipation, depression, cognitive impairment, sleep problems and disturbances of the autonomic nervous system also feature. The etiology is still unknown, although an increasing number of gene-related Parkinsonian syndromes have been identified. It is intriguing to speculate that PD starts by the intake of a toxin, bacteria or virus. This idea stems from the fact that pathological abnormalities such as Lewy neuritis, Lewy bodies and alpha-synuclein accumulation are first found in the enteric nervous system of the gut and in the olfactory bulb. There is increasing evidence that the disease may spread out from the enteric nervous system of the gut via the vagal nerve up to the brain. Here we present data from animal work which supports this assumption.

21840242|t|Differentiating Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy by [123I] meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy and olfactory test.
21840242|a|We aimed to study whether either [(123)l] myocardial meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy or the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) is effective in differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) from multiple system atrophy (MSA). We compared the MIBG accumulation and olfactory score between 42 PD and 42 MSA (19 MSA-P and 23 MSA-C) patients in the early stages. [(123)l] MIBG myocardial scintigraphy showed higher sensitivity and the olfactory test higher specificity in differentiating PD from MSA. There were significant differences between PD and MSA-C (p = 0.0019) instead of MSA-P (p > 0.05) in the MIBG accumulation, while there were significant differences between PD and MSA-P (p = 0.0003) or MSA-C (p = 0.0003) in the OSIT-J score. Our data suggest that the olfactory test can be useful as a clinical tool with its higher specificity in differentiating PD from MSA in the early stages and, moreover, support the discrimination of PD from MSA-P.

21978091|t|Combination of transcranial sonography, olfactory testing, and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy as a diagnostic indicator for Parkinson's disease.
21978091|a|BACKGROUND: Appropriate diagnostic biomarkers are useful for improving speed and accuracy of a diagnosis. Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity visualized by transcranial sonography (TCS), olfactory dysfunction, and the reduced uptake of (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in myocardial scintigraphy have been suggested as potential biomarkers for the identification of Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of these tests and to determine whether combining them increases their diagnostic power. METHODS:   Subjects were 44 patients with clinically diagnosed PD and 36 healthy controls. TCS of the SN, the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J), and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy were conducted. RESULTS: Eleven patients with PD (25%) and four controls (11%) were excluded because of an insufficient acoustic temporal bone window in the TCS. Thus, 33 patients with PD and 32 healthy controls were finally included. The diagnostic sensitivity of TCS, OSIT-J, and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was 78.8%, 84.8%, and 60.6%, respectively. The specificity of TCS and OSIT-J was 93.8% and 78.1%, respectively. The combination of TCS of the SN and OSIT-J substantially increased the sensitivity to a sufficient level for discriminating patients with PD from controls. CONCLUSION:  TCS of the SN and olfactory testing play complementary roles in increasing diagnostic power in PD. As both tests are easy to perform, noninvasive, and inexpensive, the combination of TCS of the SN and olfactory testing may contribute to early and accurate diagnosis of PD.

22192419|t|The odor stick identification test for Japanese differentiates Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy and progressive supra nuclear palsy.
22192419|a|BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) are clinically difficult to differentiate from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in the early stages of the disease. Previous reports indicated that the olfactory function is relatively intact or slightly reduced in patients with PSP and MSA-P, suggesting that the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J), which is a short and simple noninvasive test that is potentially useful clinically for detecting early-stage PD in Japan, may be useful in the differential diagnosis of early-stage PD from MSA-P and PSP. There is no information on the sensitivity and specificity of OSIT-J in the diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes such as PSP and MSA-P. METHODS: We assessed the olfactory function using the OSIT-J test in 94 Japanese patients with idiopathic PD, 15 with MSA-P, 7 with PSP, and 29 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: The mean +- SD score of OSIT-J in patients with PD (4.4 +- 2.9) was significantly lower than in patients with MSA-P (8.7 +- 2.2, P < 0.0001), PSP (7.6 +- 2.2, P < 0.0057), and control subjects (10.5 +- 1.3, P < 0.0001). The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to discriminate PD from normal control using OSIT-J scores was 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.00), from MSA-P 0.87 (0.80-0.95), and from PSP 0.81 (0.66-0.96). CONCLUSION: The OSIT-J is a potentially useful clinical test not only for detection of olfactory deficit in PD but also for differentiating PD from MSA-P and PSP.

22481508|t|[Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson disease and REM sleep behavior disorder].
22481508|a|Olfactory dysfunction is an appealing biomarker for Parkinson disease (PD) because of the high prevalence (>90%) among PD patients and the relative ease of testing, as compared to other putative biomarkers such as neuroimaging of the dopamine system. Hyposmia develops during the early stages of PD and, therefore, may be one of the most sensitive markers for the early diagnosis of PD. Sniffin' Sticks, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, and the Odor Stick Identification test for the Japanese, a short and simple nonlexical, olfactory identification test, can be useful for diagnosing PD and for discriminating between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is indicative of the development of neurodegenerative diseases involving synuclein pathology, including PD, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Reduced odor identification was comparable in patients with PD, DLB, and RBD, but distinct from that in healthy subjects. Further, insights obtained from a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD and RBD may lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying Lewy neurodegenerative diseases.

22510205|t|The validity and reliability of the Italian Olfactory Identification Test (IOIT) in healthy subjects and in Parkinson's disease patients.
22510205|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory function can be rapidly evaluated by means of standardized olfactory tests. Multiple-choice smell identification tests can be conditioned by cultural background. To investigate a new tool for detecting olfactory deficit in Italian subjects we developed a multiple-choice identification test prepared with odorants belonging to the Italian culture. METHODS: The Italian Olfactory Identification Test (IOIT) was developed with 33 microencapsulated odorants with intensity of odors and headspace Gas Chromatography being tested. Test-retest reliability of the IOIT was evaluated. The IOIT was administered to 511 controls and 133 Parkinson's patients. RESULTS: In healthy subjects the number of IOIT errors increased with age for both females (p < 0.0001) and males (p < 0.0001), while in the Parkinson's disease group the number of IOIT errors was significantly greater where compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.0001 in all age groups). The reference limits applied to all age groups revealed an IOIT sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 99%. The test-retest reliability was excellent. CONCLUSION: The IOIT is highly reliable, disposable, easy to administer, not fragile, and has a long shelf-life. All these features make the IOIT suitable for clinical use as well as for population screening and to discriminate Parkinson's patients from healthy subjects.

22551361|t|An olfactory 'stress test' may detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
22551361|a|BACKGROUND: The olfactory bulb (OB) receives extensive cholinergic input from the basal forebrain and is affected very early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We speculated that an olfactory 'stress test' (OST), targeting the OB, might be used to unmask incipient AD. We investigated if change in olfactory performance following intranasal atropine was associated with several known antecedents or biomarkers of AD. METHODS: We measured change in performance on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in the left nostril before (20-items) and after (remaining 20-items) intranasal administration of 1 mg of atropine. We administered cognitive tests, measured hippocampal volume from MRI scans and recorded Apolipoprotein E genotype as indices relevant to underlying AD. RESULTS: In a convenience sample of 56 elderly individuals (14 probable AD, 13 cognitive impairment no dementia, 29 cognitively intact) the change in UPSIT score after atropine ('atropine effect' = AE) correlated significantly with demographically scaled episodic memory score (r = 0.57, p < 0.001) and left hippocampal volume (LHCV) (r = 0.53, p < 0.001). Among non-demented individuals (n = 42), AE correlated with episodic memory (r = 0.52, p < 0.001) and LHCV (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) and hierarchical linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, education, and baseline UPSIT showed that the AE explained more variance in memory performance (24%) than did LHCV (15%). The presence of any APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with a more negative AE (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The OST using atropine as an olfactory probe holds promise as a simple, inexpensive screen for early and preclinical AD and further work, including longitudinal studies, is needed to explore this possibility.

22608241|t|Immunization targeting a minor plaque constituent clears beta-amyloid and rescues behavioral deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
22608241|a|Although anti-human beta-amyloid (Abeta) immunotherapy clears brain beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), targeting additional brain plaque constituents to promote clearance has not been attempted. Endogenous murine Abeta is a minor Abeta plaque component in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic AD models, which we show is ~3%-8% of the total accumulated Abeta in various human APP transgenic mice. Murine Abeta codeposits and colocalizes with human Abeta in amyloid plaques, and the two Abeta species coimmunoprecipitate together from brain extracts. In the human APP transgenic mouse model Tg2576, passive immunization for 8 weeks with a murine-Abeta-specific antibody reduced beta-amyloid plaque pathology, robustly decreasing both murine and human Abeta levels. The immunized mice additionally showed improvements in two behavioral assays, odor habituation and nesting behavior. We conclude that passive anti-murine Abeta immunization clears Abeta plaque pathology--including the major human Abeta component--and decreases behavioral deficits, arguing that targeting minor endogenous brain plaque constituents can be beneficial, broadening the range of plaque-associated targets for AD therapeutics.

23000537|t|Chronic anti-murine Abeta immunization preserves odor guided behaviors in an Alzheimer's beta-amyloidosis model.
23000537|a|Olfaction is often impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is also dysfunctional in mouse models of the disease. We recently demonstrated that short-term passive anti-murine-Abeta immunization can rescue olfactory behavior in the Tg2576 mouse model overexpressing a human mutation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) after beta-amyloid deposition. Here we tested the ability to preserve normal olfactory behaviors by means of long-term passive anti-murine-Abeta immunization. Seven-month-old Tg2576 and non-transgenic littermate (NTg) mice were IP-injected biweekly with the m3.2 murine-Abeta-specific antibody until 16 mo of age when mice were tested in the odor habituation test. While Tg2576 mice treated with a control antibody showed elevations in odor investigation times and impaired odor habituation compared to NTg, olfactory behavior was preserved to NTg levels in m3.2-immunized Tg2576 mice. Immunized Tg2576 mice had significantly less beta-amyloid immunolabeling in the olfactory bulb and entorhinal cortex, yet showed elevations in Thioflavin-S labeled plaques in the piriform cortex. No detectable changes in APP metabolite levels other than Abeta were found following m3.2 immunization. These results demonstrate efficacy of chronic, long-term anti-murine-Abeta m3.2 immunization in preserving normal odor-guided behaviors in a human APP Tg model. Further, these results provide mechanistic insights into olfactory dysfunction as a biomarker for AD by yielding evidence that focal reductions of Abeta may be sufficient to preserve olfaction.

23325906|t|Olfaction and imaging biomarkers in premotor LRRK2 G2019S-associated Parkinson disease.
23325906|a|OBJECTIVE: To ascertain in a cross-sectional study whether substantia nigra (SN) echogenicity, olfaction, and dopamine transporter (DaT)-SPECT are reliable premotor biomarkers in a cohort of asymptomatic carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (AsG2019S+). METHODS: These biomarkers were evaluated in 49 AsG2019S+ patients, and we also studied olfaction and SN echogenicity in 29 patients with G2019S-associated Parkinson disease (PD-G2019S), 47 relatives who were noncarriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (AsG2019S-), 50 patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (iPD), and 50 community controls. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of unaffected mutation carriers (AsG2019S+) showed pathologic SN hyperechogenicity, with a similar proportion observed among both PD-G2019S and iPD cases, and 41% of AsG2019S- also showing increased SN echogenicity. The proportion of hyposmic individuals was not statistically different in patients with PD-G2019S (50%) and iPD (82%), but hyposmia was significantly less common in both AsG2019S+ (26%) and AsG2019S- (28%). In AsG2019S+ cases, reduced striatal uptake in DaT-SPECT was observed in 43.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Independently of age at examination, the most frequently altered premotor biomarker in LRRK2 G2019S-associated PD was SN hyperechogenicity, whereas abnormal DaT-SPECT predominated in older, unaffected mutation carriers.

23573275|t|Rasagiline ameliorates olfactory deficits in an alpha-synuclein mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
23573275|a|Impaired olfaction is an early pre-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease. The neuropathology underlying olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is unknown, however alpha-synuclein accumulation/aggregation and altered neurogenesis might play a role. We characterized olfactory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease expressing human wild-type alpha-synuclein under the control of the mouse alpha-synuclein promoter. Preliminary clinical observations suggest that rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor, improves olfaction in Parkinson's disease. We therefore examined whether rasagiline ameliorates olfactory deficits in this Parkinson's disease model and investigated the role of olfactory bulb neurogenesis. alpha-Synuclein mice were progressively impaired in their ability to detect odors, to discriminate between odors, and exhibited alterations in short-term olfactory memory. Rasagiline treatment rescued odor detection and odor discrimination abilities. However, rasagiline did not affect short-term olfactory memory. Finally, olfactory changes were not coupled to alterations in olfactory bulb neurogenesis. We conclude that rasagiline reverses select olfactory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease. The findings correlate with preliminary clinical observations suggesting that rasagiline ameliorates olfactory deficits in Parkinson's disease.

24451436|t|Olfactory impairment and subjective olfactory complaints independently predict conversion to dementia: a longitudinal, population-based study.
24451436|a|We examined whether conversion to dementia can be predicted by self-reported olfactory impairment and/or by an inability to identify odors. Common forms of dementia involve an impaired sense of smell, and poor olfactory performance predicts cognitive decline among the elderly. We followed a sample of 1529 participants, who were within a normal range of overall cognitive function at baseline, over a 10-year period during which 159 were classified as having a dementia disorder. Dementia conversion was predicted from demographic variables, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and olfactory assessments. Self-reported olfactory impairment emerged as an independent predictor of dementia. After adjusting for effects of other predictors, individuals who rated their olfactory sensitivity as "worse than normal" were more likely to convert to dementia than those who reported normal olfactory sensitivity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.40, 3.37]). Additionally, low scores on an odor identification test also predicted conversion to dementia (OR per 1 point increase = 0.89; 95% CI [0.81, 0.98]), but these two effects were additive. We suggest that assessing subjective olfactory complaints might supplement other assessments when evaluating the risk of conversion to dementia. Future studies should investigate which combination of olfactory assessments is most useful in predicting dementia conversion.

24777169|t|Accelerometer-based quantitative analysis of axial nocturnal movements differentiates patients with Parkinson's disease, but not high-risk individuals, from controls.
24777169|a|INTRODUCTION: There is a need for prodromal markers to diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD) as early as possible. Knowing that most patients with overt PD have abnormal nocturnal movement patterns, we hypothesised that such changes might occur already in non-PD individuals with a potentially high risk for future development of the disease. METHODS: Eleven patients with early PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage <=2.5), 13 healthy controls and 33 subjects with a high risk of developing PD (HR-PD) were investigated. HR-PD was defined by the occurrence of hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra in combination with prodromal markers (eg, slight motor signs, olfactory dysfunction). A triaxial accelerometer was used to quantify nocturnal movements during two nights per study participant. Outcome measurements included mean acceleration, and qualitative axial movement parameters, such as duration and speed. RESULTS: Mean acceleration of nocturnal movements was lower in patients with PD compared to controls. Frequency and speed of axial movements did not differ between patients with PD and controls, but mean size and duration were lower in PD. The HR-PD group did not significantly differ from the control group in any of the parameters analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, patients with PD had an overall decreased mean acceleration, as well as smaller and shorter nocturnal axial movements. These changes did not occur in our potential HR-PD individuals, suggesting that relevant axial movement alterations during sleep have either not developed or cannot be detected by the means applied in this at-risk cohort.

25263790|t|A novel mitochondrially-targeted apocynin derivative prevents hyposmia and loss of motor function in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2(R1441G)) transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
25263790|a|Recently, we demonstrated that dimeric apocynin prevented loss of motor function in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2(R1441G)) transgenic (tg) mouse (treated with 200mg/kg, three times per week) [B.P. Dranka et al., Neurosci. Lett. 549 (2013) 57-62]. Here we extend those studies by treating LRRK2(R1441G) mice with an orally-available, mitochondrially-targeted apocynin derivative. We hypothesized that the increased mitochondrial permeability of Mito-apocynin, due to the triphenylphosphonium moiety, would allow improvement of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms at lower doses than those required for diapocynin. Tests of motor coordination (pole test, Rotor-Rod) revealed a significant deficit in coordinated motor function in LRRK2(R1441G) mice by 15 months of age. Decreased performance on the pole test and Rotor-Rod in the LRRK2(R1441G) mice was prevented with Mito-apocynin treatment (3mg/kg, three times per week). Decreased olfactory function is an early indication of PD in human patients. LRRK2(R1441G) tg mice displayed deficits in sense of smell in both the hidden treat test, and a radial arm maze test. Interestingly, treatment with Mito-apocynin prevented this hyposmia, and animals retained normal ability to identify either a scented treat or a food pellet as well as wild type littermates. Together, these data demonstrate that the mitochondria-targeted apocynin analog is effective in preventing early PD-like symptoms in the LRRK2(R1441G) mouse model.

25433460|t|Aging, but not tau pathology, impacts olfactory performances and somatostatin systems in THY-Tau22 mice.
25433460|a|Somatostatin (SOM) cortical levels decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in correlation with cognitive impairment severity, the latter being closely related to the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. Impaired olfaction is another hallmark of AD tightly related to tau pathology in the olfactory pathways. Recent studies showed that SOM modulates olfactory processing, suggesting that alterations in SOM levels participate to olfactory deficits in AD. Herein, we first observed that human olfactory peduncle and cortex are enriched in SOM cells and fibers, in aged postmortem brains. Then, the possible link between SOM alterations and olfactory deficits was evaluated by exploring the impact of age and tau hyperphosphorylation on olfactory SOM networks and behavioral performances in THY-Tau22 mice, a tauopathy transgenic model. Distinct molecular repertoires of SOM peptide and receptors were associated to sensory or cortical olfactory processing structures. Aging mainly affected SOM neurotransmission in piriform and entorhinal cortex in wild-type mice, although olfactory performances decreased. However, no further olfactory impairment was evidenced in THY-Tau22 mice until 12 months although tau pathology early affected olfactory cortical structures. Thus, tau hyperphosphorylation per se has a limited impact on olfactory performances in THY-Tau22 mice.

25633674|t|Olfactory cortex degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
25633674|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits are prevalent in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These symptoms precede clinical onset of cognitive and memory deficits and coincide with AD pathology preferentially in the central olfactory structures, suggesting a potential biomarker for AD early detection and progression. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that structural degeneration of the primary olfactory cortex (POC) could be detected in AD as well as in MCI patients and would be correlated with olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) alterations, reflecting loss of olfactory cortex activity. METHODS: Total structural volumes and fMRI activation volumes of the POC and hippocampus were measured along with olfactory and cognitive behavioral tests in 27 cognitively normal (CN), 21 MCI, and 15 AD subjects. RESULTS: Prominent atrophy in the POC and hippocampus was found in both AD and MCI subjects and correlated with behavioral measurements. While behavioral and volumetric measurements showed a gradual decline from CN to MCI to AD, olfactory activation volume in the POC and hippocampus showed a steeper decline in the MCI group compared to corresponding tissue volume, resembling the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Decline in olfactory activity was correlated with the AD structural degeneration in the POC. A more prominent olfactory activity deficit than that of behavioral and tissue volume measurements was shown in the MCI stage. Olfactory fMRI may thus provide an earlier and more sensitive measure of functional neurodegeneration in AD and MCI patients.

25986741|t|Olfactory function combined with morphology distinguishes Parkinson's disease.
25986741|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether the volume of the olfactory bulbs and tracts (OB & T) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) from PD-related disorders. METHODS: The study group comprised 13 patients with PD, 11 with multiple system atrophy (MSA), five with progressive supranuclear palsy, and five with corticobasal degeneration (PSP/CBD). All patients were evaluated using the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J), (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, and brain MRI. OB & T areas on 1-mm-thick coronal images were measured and summed for volumes. We examined relationships between olfactory function and volume, and cardiovascular dysautonomia. We defined the cut-off values for OSIT-J score or MIBG uptake and OB & T volume to discriminate PD from PD-related disorders and calculated the proportional rate of PD in four categorized groups. RESULTS: OB & T volume was smaller in PD than in MSA or PSP/CBD (p < 0.05 each). The cut-off for detecting PD patients was OSIT-J score <8, heart/mediastinum ratio <1.6, and OB & T volume <270 mm(3). In the group with OSIT-J score <8 and OB & T volume <270 mm(3), the proportion of PD patients among all patients with PD-related disorders was 91%. The rate of probable PD gradually increased as OSIT-J score and OB & T volume decreased (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, these data obtained from a combined morphological and functional evaluation of OB or cardiovascular dysautonomia could be useful for further differential of PD and other PD-related disorders.

26416397|t|The relevance of pre-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
26416397|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) has a wide range of non-motor symptoms including; constipation, sleep disturbance, deficits in vision and olfaction, mood disorders and cardiac autonomic dysfunction. Several of these non-motor symptoms can manifest prior to the onset of motor symptoms. Recognizing these pre-motor symptoms may enable early diagnosis of PD. Currently, no single pre-motor symptom is able to predict the development of PD with 100% sensitivity or specificity. Ongoing studies in several independent at-risk cohorts should reveal the potential of combinations of pre-motor symptoms and multi-stage screening strategies to identify individuals at increased risk of PD. PD progression may be governed by a prion-like spread of a-syn throughout the nervous system. Identifying individuals at the earliest stage will likely be critical to preventing the pathological progression of PD, highlighting the relevance of pre-motor symptoms in the future treatment of the disease.

26512070|t|Comparison of Olfactory Identification Patterns among Parkinson's Disease Patients from Different Countries.
26512070|a|Olfactory function assessment is an important screening tool and also may differentiate Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from other parkinsonisms, including nondegenerative ones, such as, normal pressure hydrocephalus, vascular, drug induced, or infectious parkinsonism. Several authors in different countries have reported various sets of odors that best differentiate between these conditions. It is debated if distinctive patterns of "restrictive" or "selective" hyposmia in PD may be affected by cultural aspects. To compare the olfactory identification function in PD across different countries, we analyzed Sniffin' Sticks identification task results between 112 PD patients from Argentina and previously reported data of PD patients from Brazil (106 patients), the Netherlands (400 patients), Germany (40 patients), China (110 patients), and Sri Lanka (89 patients). Categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) was performed to find components reflecting groups of odors similarly perceived across subjects. CATPCA analysis found 2 components for each group which shared 10 out of 16 odors amongst each other. We found that only the shared items of component 2 (orange, mint, banana, garlic, coffee, cloves, and fish) showed uniform results across all of the included countries, whereas variations in component 1 (licorice, turpentine, and apple) were attributed mostly to differences across control groups.

26911386|t|Prevalence of impaired odor identification in Parkinson disease with imaging evidence of nigrostriatal denervation.
26911386|a|There is wide variability in the reported prevalence rates of abnormal smell in Parkinson disease (PD). This study assessed the prevalence of abnormal smell, using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), in 183 patients with PD with confirmed PET imaging evidence of nigrostriatal denervation. Impaired olfaction in this sample was nearly universal (97.8 %). Wide-ranging prior olfactory impairment estimates may reflect not only uncertainty regarding diagnostic classification, but also the use of inaccurate normative data and differences in olfactory tests used.

26969629|t|Sex and Genotype Differences in Odor Detection in the 3xTg-AD and 5XFAD Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease at 6 Months of Age.
26969629|a|Deficits in odor identification and detection are early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two transgenic mouse models of AD, the 5XFAD and the 3xTg-AD mice and their wildtype controls, were assessed for olfactory detection with decreasing concentrations of ethyl acetate in a go no-go operant olfactometer task at 6 months of age. For both the 5XFAD and their B6SJLF1 wildtype littermates, females made fewer errors in detecting the ethyl acetate than males on all but the lowest odor concentrations. Female 5XFAD mice performed slightly better than their female wildtype littermates on the higher odor concentrations, though not at the lowest concentration. The 3xTg-AD females showed decreased olfactory detection compared with their wildtype B6129S1 controls, whereas there was no difference in the males. Therefore, although the 5XFAD mice showed no olfactory detection deficits, female 3xTg-AD mice had impaired olfactory detection at low odor concentrations but males did not. This difference in odor detection should be considered in studies of olfactory learning and memory, as differences in performance may be due to sensory rather than cognitive factors, though detection seems unimpaired at high odor concentrations.

27498392|t|An early dysregulation of FAK and MEK/ERK signaling pathways precedes the beta-amyloid deposition in the olfactory bulb of APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
27498392|a|UNLABELLED: Olfactory dysfunction is an early event of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms associated to AD neurodegeneration in olfactory areas are unknown. Here we used double-transgenic amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APPswe/PS1dE9) mice and label-free quantitative proteomics to analyze early pathological effects on the olfactory bulb (OB) during AD progression. Prior to beta-amyloid plaque formation, 9 modulated proteins were detected on 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice while 16 differential expressed proteins were detected at 6months, when beta-amyloid plaques appear, indicating a moderate imbalance in cytoskeletal rearrangement, and synaptic plasticity in APP/PS1 OBs. Moreover, beta-amyloid induced an inactivation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) together with a transient activation of MEK1/2, leading to inactivation of ERK1/2 in 6-months APP/PS1 OBs. In contrast, the analysis of human OBs revealed a late activation of FAK in advanced AD stages, whereas ERK1/2 activation was enhanced across AD staging respect to controls. This survival potential was accompanied by the inhibition of the proapototic factor BAD in the OB across AD phenotypes. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the early molecular mechanisms that are modulated in AD neurodegeneration, highlighting significant differences in the regulation of survival pathways between APP/PS1 mice and sporadic human AD. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss of smell is involved in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), usually preceding classic disease symptoms. However, the mechanisms governing this dysfunction are still poorly understood, losing its potential as a useful tool for clinical diagnosis. Our study characterizes potential AD-associated molecular changes in APP/PS1 mice olfactory bulb (OB) using MS-quantitative proteomics, revealing early cytoskeletal disruption and synaptic plasticity impairment. Moreover, an opposite pattern was found when comparing the activation status of specific survival pathways between APP/PS1 OBs and OBs derived from sAD subjects with different neuropathological grading. Our data reflect, in part, the progressive effect of APP overproduction and Abeta accumulation on the OB proteome during AD progression.

27786242|t|Advances in markers of prodromal Parkinson disease.
27786242|a|Efforts to develop neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson disease (PD) are focusing on the early stages of disease, which offer the best opportunity to intervene. Early PD can be divided into preclinical, prodromal and clinical stages; in this Review, we focus on the prodromal stage and markers that can be used to identify prodromal PD. We consider the necessary properties of a marker, before providing an overview of the proven and potential markers of prodromal PD, including clinical nonmotor markers, clinical motor markers, neuroimaging markers and tissue biomarkers. Markers for which the ability to predict conversion to PD is supported by the strongest evidence include olfactory loss, REM sleep behaviour disorder and constipation. Markers with the highest diagnostic strength include REM sleep behaviour disorder, dopaminergic imaging and subtle motor parkinsonism. The lead time - the period between the appearance of a marker and conversion to PD - is highly variable between markers, ranging from 5 years for impaired motor performance to >20 years for autonomic symptoms. The cost of screening for these markers also varies dramatically: some require just questionnaires, whereas others require sophisticated scanning techniques. Finally, we summarize how prodromal and risk markers can be combined to estimate the probability that an individual has prodromal PD, with a focus on the International Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) Prodromal Parkinson Criteria.

27855167|t|Assessment of Olfactory Function in MAPT-Associated Neurodegenerative Disease Reveals Odor-Identification Irreproducibility as a Non-Disease-Specific, General Characteristic of Olfactory Dysfunction.
27855167|a|Olfactory dysfunction is associated with normal aging, multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease, and other diseases such as diabetes, sleep apnea and the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis. The wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders associated with olfactory dysfunction suggests different, potentially overlapping, underlying pathophysiologies. Studying olfactory dysfunction in presymptomatic carriers of mutations known to cause familial parkinsonism provides unique opportunities to understand the role of genetic factors, delineate the salient characteristics of the onset of olfactory dysfunction, and understand when it starts relative to motor and cognitive symptoms. We evaluated olfactory dysfunction in 28 carriers of two MAPT mutations (p.N279K, p.P301L), which cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Olfactory dysfunction in carriers does not appear to be allele specific, but is strongly age-dependent and precedes symptomatic onset. Severe olfactory dysfunction, however, is not a fully penetrant trait at the time of symptom onset. Principal component analysis revealed that olfactory dysfunction is not odor-class specific, even though individual odor responses cluster kindred members according to genetic and disease status. Strikingly, carriers with incipient olfactory dysfunction show poor inter-test consistency among the sets of odors identified incorrectly in successive replicate tests, even before severe olfactory dysfunction appears. Furthermore, when 78 individuals without neurodegenerative disease and 14 individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease were evaluated twice at a one-year interval using the Brief Smell Identification Test, the majority also showed inconsistency in the sets of odors they identified incorrectly, independent of age and cognitive status. While these findings may reflect the limitations of these tests used and the sample sizes, olfactory dysfunction appears to be associated with the inability to identify odors reliably and consistently, not with the loss of an ability to identify specific odors. Irreproducibility in odor identification appears to be a non-disease-specific, general feature of olfactory dysfunction that is accelerated or accentuated in neurodegenerative disease. It may reflect a fundamental organizational principle of the olfactory system, which is more "error-prone" than other sensory systems.

28326534|t|Smell Loss Predicts Mortality Risk Regardless of Dementia Conversion.
28326534|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether dementia could explain the association between poor olfactory performance and mortality risk within a decade-long follow-up period. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Betula Study, Umea, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based sample of adult participants without dementia at baseline aged 40 to 90 (N = 1,774). MEASUREMENTS: Olfactory performance using the Scandinavian Odor-Identification Test (SOIT) and self-reported olfactory function; several social, cognitive, and medical risk factors at baseline; and incident dementia during the following decade. RESULTS: Within the 10-year follow-up, 411 of 1,774 (23.2%) participants had died. In a Cox model, the association between higher SOIT score and lower mortality was significant (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.74 per point interval, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71-0.77, P < .001). The effect was attenuated, but remained significant, after controlling for age, sex, education, and health-related and cognitive variables (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.87-0.97, P = .001). The association between SOIT score and mortality was retained after controlling for dementia conversion before death (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.87-0.97, P = .001). Similar results were obtained for self-reported olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Poor odor identification and poor self-reported olfactory function are associated with greater likelihood of future mortality. Dementia does not attenuate the association between olfactory loss and mortality, suggesting that olfactory loss might mark deteriorating health, irrespective of dementia.

28802931|t|Nonmotor Aspects of Parkinson's Disease-How Do They Help Diagnosis?
28802931|a|Not only are nonmotor aspects of Parkinson's disease important because of their impact, they also can help diagnose Parkinson's. This chapter summarizes the ways in which recognition of the nonmotor profile of Parkinson's can help in clinical diagnosis. It also emphasizes the essential role that nonmotor Parkinson's disease plays in the diagnosis of prodromal stages of disease.

28882322|t|Who Can Diagnose Parkinson's Disease First? Role of Pre-motor Symptoms.
28882322|a|In 1817, James Parkinson described the disease which bears his name. The disease was defined as a neurological syndrome characterized by tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movements. Almost one hundred years later, degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra and low levels of dopamine were identified as the putative cause of the disease, thus the disease remained as a pure neurological disorder. In the late 1990s, non-motor symptoms of the disease began to gain interest because of their clinical relevance, as well as for their potential role in broadening the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. In the last decade, focus has shifted to the pre-motor symptoms, those non-motor symptoms that present years before the motor onset of the disease. The main premotor symptoms include rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation and depression. Subjects with these symptoms usually are not initially seen by a neurologist, and by the time they are consulted neuronal loss in the substantia nigra is over 50%. This review summarizes the overall relevance of non-motor symptoms, their frequency and their pathophysiological implications. Also, the importance of pre-motor symptoms, and the role of specialists other than neurologists in diagnosing subjects with Parkinson's disease is discussed. Two hundred years after the first description of the disease, it is now evident that Parkinson's disease is a systemic disease and a multispecialty team approach is mandatory.

29134611|t|Exploring white matter microstructure and olfaction dysfunction in early parkinson disease: diffusion MRI reveals new insight.
29134611|a|Olfaction dysfunction is considered as a robust marker of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD). Measurement of olfaction function as a screening test is unsatisfactory due to long lead time interval and low specificity for detection of PD. Use of imaging markers might yield more accurate predictive values and provide bases for combined use of imaging and clinical markers for early PD. Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted on 85 de novo PD patients in and 36 healthy controls to find: first, white matter tracts with significant difference in quantitative anisotropy between PD groups with various degrees of olfaction dysfunction and second, second fibers with correlation with University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score in each group using a multiple regression analysis considering age, sex, GDS and MoCA score. Local connectomes were determined in seven of all the possible comparisons, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). PD patients with anosmia and normal olfaction had the highest number of fibers with decreased connectivity in left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral fornix, bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), bilateral cingulum, bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) and body, genu and splenium of corpus callosum (CC) (FDR = 0.0013). In multiple regression analysis, connectivity in the body, genu and splenium of CC and bilateral fornix had significant negative correlation (FDR between 0.019 and 0.083), and bilateral cingulum and MCP had significant positive correlation (FDR between 0.022 and 0.092) with UPSIT score. White matter connectivity in healthy controls could not be predicted by UPSIT score using the same model. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that microstructural degenerative changes in these areas underlie the clinical phenotype of prodromal olfaction dysfunction in PD and that diffusion parameters of these areas might be able to serve as signature markers for early detection of PD. This is the first report that confirms a discriminative role for UPSIT score in identifying PD specific changes in white matter microstructure. Our results open a window to identify microstructural signatures of prodromal PD in white matter.

29202669|t|The relationship between smell identification and neuropsychological domains: Results from a sample of community-dwelling adults suspected of dementia.
29202669|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the theoretical relationships between smell identification and cognitive tasks based on existing neuroimaging and anatomical findings. METHOD: Utilizing data collected from a memory assessment clinic, theory-derived mediation and moderation models were tested. The sample used in this study consisted of 103 (39 male, 64 female) individuals referred for memory assessments. The sample's mean education was 12.4 years (SD = 3.2), and the mean age of the sample was 77.2 years (SD = 6.3). RESULTS: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was a significant, partial mediator of the relationship between the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Immediate and Delayed Memory indexes. Olfactory identification did not mediate list learning and retrieval; however, olfactory identification was a significant partial mediator of the relationship between story encoding and later memory retrieval of the story. Olfactory identification also fully mediated the relationship between a visuospatial construction task and its reconstruction from memory after a short delay. The relationship between processing speed and the olfactory identification was significantly mediated by semantic memory. Finally, the UPSIT moderated the relationship between a measure of premorbid ability, the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, and current global cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support theoretical relationships between olfaction and neuropsychological domains. Additionally, our results suggest that the UPSIT may serve as a proxy for cerebral integrity and is likely related to the duration of neurodegeneration.

29233469|t|Olfactory dysfunctions in drug-naive Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment.
29233469|a|BACKGROUND: Evaluation of olfactory function is valuable for the detection of pre-motor state of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients have an increased risk of associated dementia and one-third of PD patients have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at the time of diagnosis. However, the characteristics of olfactory dysfunction in PD-MCI patients are unclear. This study examined the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive function in drug-naive PD at the time of diagnosis with the patterns of olfactory function in PD-MCI patients using the Korean version of the Sniffin' stick test II (KVSS II). METHODS: A total of 66 drug-naive PD patients were enrolled. A neuropsychiatric assessment battery and KVSS II were performed. For the statistical analyses, univariate, multivariable linear regression and Student's t-test were used to determine the relationship between the variables and olfactory function. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction was more prevalent in the PD-MCI group than in the PD-normal cognition (PD-CN) group. Each domains of odor threshold, discrimination, identification and total olfactory score were more impaired in the PD-MCI group than the PD-CN group. Whether cognitive impairment was single or multiple domain was not affected. CONCLUSION: PD-MCI is more likely to be associated with severe olfactory impairment than PD-CN. There may be more extensive neurodegenerative processes affecting olfaction in PD-MCI patients. With further investigation and validation using neuropathological data, an objective olfactory function test could be used as a tool to evaluate disease progression. Further studies with prospective design investigating the prognostic value of olfactory dysfunction in PD-MCI patients are essential.

29332036|t|Relationships Between Lower Olfaction and Brain White Matter Lesions in Elderly Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
29332036|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory impairment is reported in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with hippocampal atrophy. In elderly people, dementia with AD neuropathology and white matter lesions (WML) is common. In this context, olfactory impairment could also depend on the presence of WML. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional relationship between olfaction and WML in elderly subjects with MCI. METHODS: Consecutive subjects, >65 years old, diagnosed as MCI after a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment in an expert memory center, with a brain MRI performed within a year and without major depressive state, were included. Olfaction was assessed by the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Two trained neuroradiologists, blind to cognitive and olfaction status, visually assessed hippocampal atrophy according to Scheltens' scale and WML according to Fazekas criteria. RESULTS: Seventy-five MCI subjects (mean age (SD) = 77.1 (6.2) years, 74.7% of women) were included. After adjustment for age and sex, factors associated with low BSIT scores were older age (p = 0.007), lower BMI (p = 0.08), lower MMSE score (p = 0.05), lower FCRST (p = 0.008), hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.04), periventricular WML (p = 0.007), and deep WML burden (p = 0.005). In multivariate analysis, severe deep WML (OR (95% CI) = 6.29 (1.4-35.13), p = 0.02) remained associated with low BSIT score independently from hippocampal atrophy. CONCLUSION: In elderly MCI subjects, low olfactory performances are associated with WML, whose progression may be slowed by vascular treatments. A longitudinal study to evaluate whether the progression of WML, hippocampal atrophy and low olfactory function, can predict accurately conversion from MCI to dementia is ongoing.

29804147|t|Correlation among olfactory function, motors' symptoms, cognitive impairment, apathy, and fatigue in patients with Parkinson's disease.
29804147|a|Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is usually considered as a movement disorder, it is strongly associated with non-motor symptoms (NMS), including smell and taste dysfunctions, cognitive impairment, apathy, fatigue, and autonomic dysregulation. Olfactory deficit is considered the most common NMS in PD preceding the motor symptoms for years. The aim of this study was to investigate olfactory function, cognitive impairment, apathy, and fatigue in patients with PD in comparison with healthy controls, and subsequently to analyse the correlations between these NMS and motor symptoms severity in subjects with PD. One hundred and forty-seven participants were enrolled (96 PD patients, mean age in years 67.5, SD 7.2; 51 healthy controls; mean age 65.1, SD 11.8). Olfactory function was evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks test (odor detection threshold, discrimination and identification). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment. Apathy was examined by the self-report version of Starkstein Apathy Scale and fatigue was evaluated with the Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale. PD patients showed severe impairment in odor detection threshold, discrimination, and identification compared to healthy controls. Moreover, in PD patients, apathy and fatigue scores were significantly increased, while MoCA scores were decreased in comparison with controls. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that both apathy and Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) were associated with odor identification, discrimination and Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score. In conclusion, our results reported changes in apathy and motor disability as significant predictors in alterations of odor identification, discrimination and TDI score. Furthermore, these data suggest that olfactory dysfunction might progress in tight relation with motor impairment UPDRS but also with non-motor symptoms such as apathy.

29989795|t|Sensor Array for Detection of Early Stage Parkinson's Disease before Medication.
29989795|a|Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is important because it affects the choice of therapy and is subject to a relatively high degree of error. In addition, early detection of PD can potentially enable the start of neuroprotective therapy before extensive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra occurs. However, until now, studies for early detection of PD using volatile biomarkers sampled only treated and medicated patients. Therefore, there is a great need to evaluate untreated patients for establishing a real world screening and diagnostic technology. Here we describe for the first time a clinical trial to distinguish between de novo PD and control subjects using an electronic system for detection of volatile molecules in exhaled breath (sensor array). We further determine for the first time the association to other common tests for PD diagnostics as smell, ultrasound, and nonmotor symptoms. The test group consisted of 29 PD patients after initial diagnosis by an experienced neurologist, compared with 19 control subjects of similar age. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values of the sensor array to detect PD from controls were 79%, 84%, and 81% respectively, in comparison with midbrain ultrasonography (93%, 90%, 92%) and smell detection (62%, 89%, 73%). The results confirm previous data showing the potential of sensor arrays to detect PD.

30007334|t|Diagnostic Accuracy, Item Analysis and Age Effects of the UPSIT Spanish Version in Parkinson's Disease.
30007334|a|OBJECTIVE: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is the most commonly used test to detect olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the cut-off score for clinical purposes is often difficult to establish because of age and sex effects. The current work aims to study the sensitivity and specificity of the UPSIT Spanish version and its accuracy in discriminating PD patients at different age groups from healthy controls (HC), and to perform an item analysis. METHOD: Ninety-seven non-demented PD patients and 65 HC were assessed with the UPSIT Spanish version. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for PD were calculated. Multiple regression analysis was used to define predictors of UPSIT scores. RESULTS: Using the normative cut-off score for anosmia (<=18), the UPSIT showed a sensitivity of 54.6% with a specificity of 100.0% for PD. We found that, using the UPSIT cut-off score of <=25, sensitivity was 81.4% and specificity 84.6% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.908). Diagnosis and age were good predictors of UPSIT scores (B = -10.948; p < .001; B = -0.203; p < .001). When optimal cut-off scores were considered according to age ranges (<=60, 61-70, and >=71), sensitivity and specificity values were >80.0% for all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the Spanish UPSIT version, sensitivity and specificity are improved when specific cut-off scores for different age groups are computed.

30120857|t|Mitral cells and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor: The sweet smell of success?
30120857|a|The olfactory bulb (OB) is often affected at very early stages of neurodegenerative disorders, in the so-called "prodromal" phase. In Parkinson's disease (PD), olfactory disturbances appear years before motor symptoms arise. Additionally, pathological alpha-synuclein aggregates are found in olfactory regions before spreading to other areas of the brain. Being positioned at the frontier between the brain and a potentially hostile environment, could explain the particular vulnerability of the OB. Mitral cells (MCs), the principal projecting neurons of the olfactory system, are involved in the pathogenesis and in the prion-like progression of PD. They are affected by Lewy pathology and are thought to contribute to the axonal transport of misfolded alpha-synuclein to other regions of the brain. Here, we first describe the main markers reported to distinguish MCs from other olfactory neurons. We focus on the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), a membrane protein specifically expressed in MCs. After summarizing OB pathology, we explore the idea of targeting specifically MCs with GLP-1 or its analogues. Exenatide has shown great promise as a neuroprotective and neurorestorative agent and has been used in a clinical trial for clinical PD. Since GLP-1R activation has the ability to mitigate many facets of prodromal PD pathology, we postulate that once a robust biomarker is in place that is capable of identifying individuals in the prodromal phase of PD, homing in on GLP-1R could assist in deferring, or eradicating to a significant degree, the clinical manifestation of this debilitating human disorder.

30121454|t|Association between olfactory loss and cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease.
30121454|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the cognitive deficits and olfaction in PD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 42 PD patients and 38 controls were selected. All the individuals in both groups underwent cognitive assessment with the SCOPA-Cog neuropsychological battery and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and olfactory assessment with the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 Test. Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) was diagnosed using the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria. RESULTS: The prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in PD patients was 95.24% (40/42). There was no statistically significant difference in olfaction when compared to patients with PDD and PD without cognitive deficits (5.12 +- 3.25 vs. 6.71 +- 2.63, p = 0.115). Attention [r = 0.35, 95% CI = (0.05-0.59), p =  0.01] was the only cognitive domain correlated with olfactory loss in PD patients. There was a higher correlation among the scores of cognitive and olfactory assessments in controls, r=0.40 (95% CI = [0.09-0.64], p = 0.007), with MMSE. CONCLUSION: The olfactory deficits prevalence in PD patients was significantly high. There may be a correlation between frontal lobe dysfunction and olfactory deficit.

30340975|t|Validation of the utility of the Brief Smell Identification Test in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease.
30340975|a|INTRODUCTION: Hyposmia is a common non-motor symptom occurring in Parkinson's disease (PD), and has been included in the diagnostic criteria. Although a version of the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) has been developed specifically for Chinese populations, there have been no reports of the utility of this test in the diagnosis of PD in China. OBJECTIVE: Considering the influence of cultural factors on olfactory test findings, we sought to investigate the utility and efficiency of the B-SIT in Chinese PD patients. METHODS: PD patients were recruited from the Movement Disorder Clinic of Xuanwu Hospital, and healthy controls were recruited from the Beijing Longitudinal Study on Aging Cohort II, between 2015 and 2016. The B-SIT was used for olfactory function testing in all subjects, and the familiarity of 59 odors questionnaire was performed for the investigation of familiarity of odors. RESULTS: A sample of 275 subjects participated in the study, including 112 healthy controls and 163 PD patients. The sensitivity (64.1%), specificity (83.9%), positive predictive value (83.5%) and negative predictive value (64.8%) for identifying PD were measured with the B-SIT. The consistency values between the results of self-reported smell loss and hyposmia identified by B-SIT in control and PD groups were 74.8% and 64.2%, respectively. Most of the odors in the B-SIT were familiar to people in the Chinese population, based on a survey of 3356 subjects using a familiarity questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended to use the B-SIT olfactory test instead of self-reported smell loss for PD diagnosis for Chinese.

30566305|t|Olfactory dysfunction.
30566305|a|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to suffer from a variety of non-motor symptoms, such as olfactory dysfunction. In fact, the impaired sense of smell is suggested to precede clinically detectable motor signs by several years. Furthermore, several studies demonstrated that the earliest neuropathological changes in PD brain appeared in the olfactory-related brain regions including olfactory bulb. Such an early involvement of olfactory-related areas can explain the hyposmia as one of early signs in PD. On the other hand, recent studies suggested that severe olfactory dysfunction might be a prodromal symptom of dementia associated with PD. Thus, the smell tests seem to be not only a feasible diagnostic tool for the early PD, but also a potentially useful biomarker for the Parkinson disease dementia (PDD).

30890017|t|Smell your memories: Positive effect of odor exposure on recent and remote autobiographical memories in Alzheimer's disease.
30890017|a|Introduction: There is a burgeoning interest in the effects of odor exposure on autobiographical memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We pursued this line of research by assessing the effect of odor exposure on the retrieval of recent and remote memories in AD. Method: Twenty-six patients with mild AD and 28 controls were tested in two conditions: with and without odor exposure. In each condition, participants were invited to retrieve two childhood memories, two adulthood memories, and two recent memories. Results: Analysis showed that AD patients produced a higher number of and more specific childhood memories, adulthood memories, and recent memories after odor exposure than without odor. Discussion: These findings demonstrate how odor exposure may alleviate anterograde and retrograde amnesia, at least when considering the ability of patients with mild AD to retrieve few recent or remote memories.

31383472|t|The therapeutic effect of deep brain stimulation on olfactory functions and clinical scores in Parkinson's disease.
31383472|a|Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is still a highly effective treatment option that significantly improves motor function in advanced PD. Moreover, previous findings have shown that Olfactory dysfunction (OD) has been found in a majority of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Despite this, the effect of DBS on the olfactory function is not fully understood. Here we aimed to determine the effect of STN DBS on OD by evaluating the olfactory functions in the preoperative and postoperative early stages (1st and 3rd months) in forty-five PD patients and 40 healthy controls. The therapeutic effect of DBS on the improvement of motor functions was parallelly investigated. We have observed that there was a significant improvement in OI in the 1st month and in all olfactory parameters (OT, ODI, OI, and TDI) in the 3rd month. In evaluating the motor functional scores, we have revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) difference between preoperative UPDRS-motor score (23 +- 7.3) and the postoperative 3rd month score (11.1 +- 5.1). Although Beck Depression and Anxiety scores were improved to a certain level in the 3rd month, this improvement was not at a statistically significant level (p > 0.05). As a conclusion, we have shown that STN-DBS improves the smell functions in PD within three months suggesting that the therapeutic effects of DBS might have a wide range of therapeutic spectrum. Despite some limitations (i.e., short follow-up period) our study gives a critical message that future studies are needed to evaluate the functional correlates of STN-DBS treatment in PD patients.

32597818|t|Parkinson's Disease Affects Functional Connectivity within the Olfactory-Trigeminal Network.
32597818|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a frequent symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that appears years prior to diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that PD-related OD is different from non-parkinsonian forms of olfactory dysfunction (NPOD) as PD patients maintain trigeminal sensitivity as opposed to patients with NPOD who typically exhibit reduced trigeminal sensitivity. We hypothesize the presence of a specific alteration of functional connectivity between trigeminal and olfactory processing areas in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess potential differences in functional connectivity within the chemosensory network in 15 PD patients and compared them to 15 NPOD patients, and to 15 controls. METHODS: Functional MRI scanning session included resting-state and task-related scans where participants carried out an olfactory and a trigeminal task. We compared functional connectivity, using a seed-based correlation approach, and brain network modularity of the chemosensory network. RESULTS: PD patients had impaired functional connectivity within the chemosensory network while no such changes were observed for NPOD patients. No group differences we found in modularity of the identified networks. Both patient groups exhibited impaired connectivity when executing an olfactory task, while network modularity was significantly weaker for PD patients than both other groups. When performing a trigeminal task, no changes were found for PD patients, but NPOD patients exhibited impaired connectivity. Conversely, PD patients exhibited a significantly higher network modularity than both other groups. CONCLUSION: In summary, the specific pattern of functional connectivity and chemosensory network recruitment in PD-related OD may explain distinct behavioral chemosensory features in PD when compared to NPOD patients and healthy controls.

32641719|t|Longitudinal profiling of oligomeric Abeta in human nasal discharge reflecting cognitive decline in probable Alzheimer's disease.
32641719|a|Despite clinical evidence indicating a close relationship between olfactory dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease (AD), further investigations are warranted to determine the diagnostic potential of nasal surrogate biomarkers for AD. In this study, we first identified soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta), the key biomarker of AD, in patient nasal discharge using proteomic analysis. Then, we profiled the significant differences in Abeta oligomers level between patient groups with mild or moderate cognitive decline (n = 39) and an age-matched normal control group (n = 21) by immunoblot analysis and comparing the levels of Abeta by a self-standard method with interdigitated microelectrode sensor systems. All subjects received the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) for grouping. We observed higher levels of Abeta oligomers in probable AD subjects with lower MMSE, higher CDR, and higher GDS compared to the normal control group. Moreover, mild and moderate subject groups could be distinguished based on the increased composition of two oligomers, 12-mer Abeta*56 and 15-mer AbetaO, respectively. The longitudinal cohort study confirmed that the cognitive decline of mild AD patients with high nasal discharge Abeta*56 levels advanced to the moderate stage within three years. Our clinical evidence strongly supports the view that the presence of oligomeric Abeta proteins in nasal discharge is a potential surrogate biomarker of AD and an indicator of cognitive decline progression.

33627500|t|Olfactory Testing in Parkinson Disease and REM Behavior Disorder: A Machine Learning Approach.
33627500|a|OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify an abbreviated test of impaired olfaction amenable for use in busy clinical environments in prodromal (isolated REM sleep behavior disorder [iRBD]) and manifest Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: Eight hundred ninety individuals with PD and 313 controls in the Discovery cohort study underwent Sniffin' Stick odor identification assessment. Random forests were initially trained to distinguish individuals with poor (functional anosmia/hyposmia) and good (normosmia/super-smeller) smell ability using all 16 Sniffin' Sticks. Models were retrained using the top 3 sticks ranked by order of predictor importance. One randomly selected 3-stick model was tested in a second independent PD dataset (n = 452) and in 2 iRBD datasets (Discovery n = 241, Marburg n = 37) before being compared to previously described abbreviated Sniffin' Stick combinations. RESULTS: In differentiating poor from good smell ability, the overall area under the curve (AUC) value associated with the top 3 sticks (anise/licorice/banana) was 0.95 in the Development dataset (sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%, positive predictive value 92%, negative predictive value 90%). Internal and external validation confirmed AUCs >=0.90. The combination of the 3-stick model determined poor smell, and an RBD screening questionnaire score of >=5 separated those with iRBD from controls with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 65%, 100%, 100%, and 30%. CONCLUSIONS: Our 3-Sniffin'-Stick model holds potential utility as a brief screening test in the stratification of individuals with PD and iRBD according to olfactory dysfunction. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that a 3-Sniffin'-Stick model distinguishes individuals with poor and good smell ability and can be used to screen for individuals with iRBD.

33835144|t|Olfactory-Trigeminal Interactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
33835144|a|Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a highly frequent early non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). An important step to potentially use OD for the development of early diagnostic tools of PD is to differentiate PD-related OD from other forms of non-parkinsonian OD (NPOD: postviral, sinunasal, post-traumatic, and idiopathic OD). Measuring non-olfactory chemosensory modalities, especially the trigeminal system, may allow to characterize a PD-specific olfactory profile. We here review the literature on PD-specific chemosensory alteration patterns compared with NPOD. Specifically, we focused on the impact of PD on the trigeminal system and particularly on the interaction between olfactory and trigeminal systems. As this interaction is seemingly affected in a disease-specific manner, we propose a model of interaction between both chemosensory systems that is distinct for PD-related OD and NPOD. These patterns of chemosensory impairment still need to be confirmed in prodromal PD; nevertheless, appropriate chemosensory tests may eventually help to develop diagnostic tools to identify individuals at risks for PD.

34121478|t|Incidence of Olfactory Dysfunction and Associated Factors: A Nationwide Cohort Study From South Korea.
34121478|a|OBJECTIVES: Olfactory dysfunction, a reduced or complete loss of the ability to smell, is gaining attention because of its substantial impact on an individual's quality of life and the possibility that it is an important sign of underlying disease. However, olfactory dysfunction is underdiagnosed in the general population due to diagnostic difficulty and unpredictable prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of clinically diagnosed olfactory dysfunction in South Korea by using well-organized, nationwide, population-based cohort data, and the associations between olfactory dysfunction and risk of neurodegenerative disorders. METHODS: We investigated the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort for patients diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction according to the International Classification of Diseases. Annual and overall incidence and prevalence of olfactory dysfunction during 2003 to 2013 and patient characteristics were analyzed. Based on those identified patients who were later diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorder, hazard ratios (HRs) of sociodemographic factors and comorbidities associated with neurodegenerative disorder were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: In total, 6296 patients were clinically diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction during the study period (524.67 patients/year). The prevalence increased annually and was higher in female patients. The incidence of neurodegenerative disorders among patients with olfactory dysfunction was 4.2% within the study period. Multivariate cox regression analysis of the patients (n = 249) revealed that diabetes mellitus (HR = 1.976) and depression (HR = 2.758) were significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction is underdiagnosed in South Korea, but it is clinically important considering the possibility of presymptom of neurodegenerative disorders. In clinical practice, we should consider its association with neurodegenerative disorders and possibly other systemic conditions.

34214869|t|A prospective pilot study of the effects of deep brain stimulation on olfaction and constipation in Parkinson's disease.
34214869|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) may improve olfaction and constipation in PD, using subjective measures. OBJECTIVE: To utilize objective measures to assess olfaction and constipation in PD following STN-DBS. METHODS: In this prospective pilot study, olfaction (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT]), bowel symptoms (ROME III questionnaires, daily bowel diaries, 100 mm visual analog scales for satisfaction with treatment and bowel habits), and motor manifestations of PD were evaluated before and after STN-DBS. Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was calculated. RESULTS: Ten patients (8 men, mean age 67.4 +- 6.0 years) with mean PD duration of 7.5 +- 3.7 years underwent bilateral STN-DBS, with mean follow-up of 3 months for all measures, except 7 months follow-up for bowel diaries. There was improvement in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor "off" scores (33.7 +- 6.7 before and 16.1 +- 10.8 after, P = 0.001). Mean UPSIT scores (20.0 +- 6.6 versus 17.5 +- 5.7, P = 0.03) worsened from severe to total hyposmia. Seven patients had baseline constipation and completed bowel diaries. There was improvement in number of complete spontaneous bowel motions (CBSM) per week (2.2 +- 1.9 before versus 4.7 +- 2.4 after, P = 0.04), satisfaction with treatment of constipation (44 +- 27 before versus 64 +- 25 after, P = 0.02), and with bowel motions (33 +- 22 before and 48 +- 20 after, P = 0.2). However, laxative use (P = 0.15) and LEDD (P = 0.15) were unchanged. CONCLUSION: Olfaction worsened while symptoms of constipation improved but did not resolve after STN-DBS.

34355455|t|Hippocampal volume is related to olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease.
34355455|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent evidence has suggested that hyposmia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may be due to impaired central processing. Furthermore, the hippocampus has been regarded as a critical structure linking olfactory impairment and cognitive impairment in PD patients. This study aimed to identify significant structural alterations of the hippocampus in PD patients with hyposmia, and to determine whether these structural changes are significantly associated with olfactory impairment severity. METHODS: Eighteen idiopathic PD patients with hyposmia and 18 age- and sex-matched PD patients without hyposmia were enrolled. Hippocampal volume and its subfields were measured using FreeSurfer software and compared between hyposmic and normosmic PD patients. We also compared hippocampal substructures' volumes and correlated the hippocampal volumes with hyposmia severity. RESULTS: PD patients with hyposmia had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes. Among the three components of the hippocampus, the hippocampal body showed a markedly lower volume, which correlated significantly with the cross-cultural smell identification test score that represents olfactory function status. Hippocampal subfield analysis showed that substructures (subiculum, molecular layer) that constitute the hippocampal body showed the most significant volume difference. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that atrophy of the bilateral hippocampus implies underlying problems in the central olfaction process in PD patients. In particular, the hippocampus might not only play a critical role in olfaction but could also be important for elucidating possible mechanisms of broad nonmotor symptoms in PD patients.

34704631|t|Severe histomorphological alterations in post-mortem olfactory glomeruli in Alzheimer's disease.
34704631|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. Key AD symptoms include memory and cognitive decline; however, comorbid symptoms such as depression and sensory-perceptual dysfunction are often reported. Among these, a deterioration of olfactory sensation is observed in approximately 90% of AD patients. However, the precise pathophysiological basis underlying olfactory deficits because of AD remains elusive. The olfactory glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB) receive sensory information in the olfactory processing pathway. Maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the olfactory glomerulus is critical to olfactory signalling. Herein, we conducted an in-depth histopathological assessment to reveal detailed structural alterations in the olfactory glomeruli in AD patients. Fresh frozen post-mortem OB specimens obtained from six AD patients and seven healthy age-matched individuals were examined. We used combined immunohistochemistry and stereology to assess the gross morphology and histological alterations, such as those in the expression of Abeta protein, microglia, and neurotransmitters in the OB. Electron microscopy was employed to study the ultrastructural features in the glomeruli. Significant accumulation of Abeta, morphologic damage, altered neurotransmitter levels, and microgliosis in the olfactory glomeruli of AD patients suggests that glomerular damage could affect olfactory function. Moreover, greater neurodegeneration was observed in the ventral olfactory glomeruli of AD patients. The synaptic ultrastructure revealed distorted postsynaptic densities and a decline in presynaptic vesicles in AD specimens. These findings show that the primary olfactory pathway is affected by the pathogenesis of AD, and may provide clues to identifying the mechanism involved in olfactory dysfunction in AD.

34823156|t|Smell tests can discriminate Parkinson's disease patients from healthy individuals: A meta-analysis.
34823156|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors aimed to identify the clinical tests used to assess olfactory function and examine their ability to distinguish PD with different disease duration from healthy individuals with physiological aging. METHODS: Cross-sectional studies published until May 2020 that assessed the olfaction of individuals with PD using search terms related to PD, olfactory function, and assessment were searched on PubMed, PsycInfo, Cinahl, and Web of Science databases. RESULTS: Twelve smell tests were identified from the reviewed studies (n = 125) that assessed 8776 individuals with PD. Data of 6593 individuals with PD and 8731 healthy individuals were included in the meta-analyses. Individuals with PD presented worse performance than healthy individuals, regardless of the smell test used. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was used by most studies (n = 2310 individuals with PD) and presented smaller heterogeneity. When the studies were subclassified according to the years of PD duration, there were no significant differences. CONCLUSION: All smell tests were able to discriminate the olfactory function of PD from that of healthy individuals, although the UPSIT was widely used. The abnormal olfaction was not related to the disease duration. Systematic review protocol registration (PROSPERO/2020-CRD42020160878).

35292309|t|Disrupted olfactory functional connectivity in patients with late-life depression.
35292309|a|BACKGROUND: Odor identification (OI) impairment increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and brain abnormalities in patients with late-life depression (LLD). However, it remains unclear whether abnormal functional connectivity (FC) of olfactory regions is involved in the relationship between OI impairment and dementia risk in LLD patients. The current study aims to explore the olfactory FC patterns of LLD patients and how olfactory FCs mediate the relationship between OI and cognition. METHODS: A total of 150 participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychometric and olfactory assessments. The primary and secondary olfactory regions were selected as regions of interest to investigate olfactory FC patterns and their association with OI and cognitive performance in LLD patients. RESULTS: Compared with LLD patients without OI impairment and normal controls, LLD patients with OI impairment exhibited increased FC between the left orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and left calcarine gyrus, between the left OFC and right lingual gyrus, between the right OFC and right rectus gyrus, and decreased FC between the right piriform cortex and right superior parietal lobule. Additionally, these abnormal FCs were associated with scores of OI, global cognition and language function. Finally, the FC between the right piriform cortex and right superior parietal lobule exhibited a partially mediated effect on the relationship between OI and MMSE scores. LIMITATIONS: The present study did not exclude the possible effect of drugs. CONCLUSION: LLD patients with OI impairment exhibited more disrupted olfactory FC (a decrease in the primary olfactory cortex and an increase in the secondary olfactory cortex) than LLD patients with intact OI, and these abnormal FCs may serve as potential targets for neuromodulation in LLD patients to prevent them from developing dementia.

35599484|t|A Signal Detection Analysis of Olfactory Learning in 12-Month-Old 5xFAD Mice.
35599484|a|Although Alzheimer's disease is most often studied in terms of memory impairments, olfactory dysfunction begins in the early stages. We tested olfactory learning, sensitivity, and response bias using signal detection methods in 12-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice and their wildtype controls in the operant olfactometer. Odor detection was not reduced in the 5xFAD mice, but learning was, which was worse in female 5xFAD mice than in males. Female mice were more conservative in their response strategy. Signal detection analysis allows us to discriminate between cognitive and sensory deficits of male and female mouse models of AD.

35694921|t|Olfactory Function and Markers of Brain Pathology in Non-Demented Individuals with Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease.
35694921|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting its potential use as a biomarker for early detection. It has also been linked to progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. OBJECTIVE: To study olfactory function and its associations with markers of AD brain pathology in non-demented mutation carriers of an autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) mutation and non-carrier family members. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 16 non-demented carriers of the Presenilin1 E280A ADAD mutation (mean age [SD]: 40.1 [5.3], and 19 non-carrier family members (mean age [SD]: 36.0 [5.5]) from Colombia, who completed olfactory and cognitive testing and underwent amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. RESULTS: Worse olfactory identification performance was associated with greater age in mutation carriers (r = -0.52 p = 0.037). In carriers, worse olfactory identification performance was related to worse MMSE scores (r = 0.55, p = 0.024) and CERAD delayed recall (r = 0.63, p = 0.007) and greater cortical amyloid-beta (r = -0.53, p = 0.042) and tau pathology burden (entorhinal: r = -0.59, p = 0.016; inferior temporal: r = -0.52, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Worse performance on olfactory identification tasks was associated with greater age, a proxy for disease progression in this genetically vulnerable ADAD cohort. In addition, this is the first study to report olfactory dysfunction in ADAD mutation carriers with diagnosis of MCI and its correlation with abnormal accumulation of tau pathology in the entorhinal region. Taken together, our findings suggest that olfactory dysfunction has promise as an early marker of brain pathology and future risk for dementia.

35841876|t|Synergistic effects of hIAPP and Abeta1-42 impaired the olfactory function associated with the decline of adult neurogenesis in SVZ.
35841876|a|According to many in the field,the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in type II diabetes (T2DM) populations is considerably higher than that in the normal population. Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is considered to be a common risk factor for T2DM and AD. Preliminary observations around T2DM animal model show that the decrease of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) is accompanied by olfactory dysfunction. Furthermore, impaired olfactory function could serve as to an early predictor of neurodegeneration,which is associated with cognitive impairment. However, the synergistic effects between hIAPP and amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-42 in the brain and the neurodegeneration remains to be further clarified. In this study, olfactory capacity, synaptic density, status of NSC in SVZ, and status of newborn neurons in olfactory bulb (OB) were assessed 6 months after stereotactic injection of oligomer Abeta1-42 into the dens gyrus (DG) of hIAPP-/+ mice or wild-type homogenous mice. Our results set out that Abeta42 and amylin co-localized into OB and raised Abeta42 deposition in hIAPP-/+ mice compared with wild-type brood mice. In addition, 6 months after injection of Abeta1-42 in hIAPP-/+ mice, these mice showed increased olfactory dysfunction, significant loss of synapses, depletion of NSC in SVZ, and impaired cell renewal in OB. Our present study suggested that the synergistic effects between hIAPP and Abeta1-42 impairs olfactory function and was associated with decreased neurogenesis in adults with SVZ.

36175781|t|ATH434 Rescues Pre-motor Hyposmia in a Mouse Model of Parkinsonism.
36175781|a|Hyposmia is a prevalent prodromal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), though the neuropathology that underlies this symptom is poorly understood. Unlike the substantia nigra, the status of metal homeostasis in the olfactory bulbs has not been characterized in PD. Given the increasing interest in metal modulation as a therapeutic avenue in PD, we sought to investigate bulbar metals and the effect of AT434 (formerly PBT434) an orally bioavailable, small molecule modulator of metal homeostasis on hyposmia in a mouse model of parkinsonism (the tau knockout (tau-/-) mouse). 5.5 (pre-hyposmia) and 13.5-month-old (pre-motor) mice were dosed with ATH434 (30 mg/kg/day, oral gavage) for 6 weeks. Animals then underwent behavioral analysis for olfactory and motor phenotypes. The olfactory bulbs and the substantia nigra were then collected and analyzed for metal content, synaptic markers, and dopaminergic cell number. ATH434 was able to prevent the development of hyposmia in young tau-/- mice, which coincided with a reduction in bulbar iron and copper levels, an increase in synaptophysin, and a reduction in soluble alpha-synuclein. ATH434 was able to prevent the development of motor impairment in aged tau-/- mice, which coincided with a reduction in iron levels and reduced neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. These data implicate metal dyshomeostasis in parkinsonian olfactory deficits, and champion a potential clinical benefit of ATH434 in both prodromal and clinical stages of PD.

37264675|t|The combination of olfactory dysfunction and depression increases the risk of incident dementia in older adults.
37264675|a|OBJECTIVES: Olfactory dysfunction and depression are common in later life, and both have been presented as risk factors for dementia. Our purpose was to investigate the associations between these two risk factors and determine if they had an additive effect on dementia risk. DESIGN: Olfactory function was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), and depression was classified using a combination of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score and current antidepressant use. Cross-sectional associations between depression and olfactory function were examined using correlations. Cox regression analyses were conducted to examine the longitudinal relationship between olfaction and depression and incident dementia across 12-years of follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 780 older adults (aged 70-90 years; 56.5% female) from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS) without a diagnosis of dementia at baseline. RESULTS: Partial correlation revealed a nonsignificant association between baseline depression and olfactory function after accounting for covariates (r = -.051, p = .173). Cox regression showed that depression at baseline (hazard ratio = 1.706, 95% CI 1.185-2.456, p = .004) and lower BSIT scores (HR = .845, 95%CI .789-.905, p < .001) were independently associated with a higher risk of incident dementia across 12 years. Entering both predictors together improved the overall predictive power of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Lower olfactory identification scores and depressive symptoms predict incident dementia over 12 years. The use of BSIT scores and depression in conjunction provides a greater ability to predict dementia than either used alone. Assessment of olfactory function and depression screening may provide clinical utility in the early detection of dementia.

38479044|t|Olfactory threshold as a biomarker of long-term relapse activity in multiple sclerosis.
38479044|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory threshold (OT) is a marker of short-term inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether OT predicts long-term MS clinical disease course. METHODS: This was a 6-year prospective longitudinal study on MS patients at the MS clinic Innsbruck. Clinical visits assessing the occurrence of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, and disease-modifying treatment (DMT), were conducted biannually. OT testing was performed at baseline (BL), year 1 (Y1), year 2 (Y2) and year 6 (Y6), using the threshold subscore of the "Sniffin' Sticks" test. Cognitive function was assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. RESULTS: Of 139 MS patients, 92 were eligible for Y6 follow-up. 68% experienced relapses, 53% EDSS worsening, 29% progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) and 41% cognitive deterioration. OT scores were lower at BL, Y1 and Y2 in patients requiring DMT escalation. In multivariable analysis, higher OT scores at BL, Y1, Y2 and Y6 were associated with lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio, HR: 0.65-0.92) and EDSS worsening (HR: 0.86-0.89), while no associations were found for PIRA and cognitive deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: OT is a potential surrogate marker for long-term inflammatory disease activity and DMT failure in MS.

39116421|t|A Review of the Role of Estrogens in Olfaction, Sleep and Glymphatic Functionality in Relation to Sex Disparity in Alzheimer's Disease.
39116421|a|Several risk factors contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including genetics, metabolic health, cardiovascular history, and diet. It has been observed that women appear to face a higher risk of developing AD. Among the various hypotheses surrounding the gender disparity in AD, one pertains to the potential neuroprotective properties of estrogen. Compared to men, women are believed to be more susceptible to neuropathology due to the significant decline in circulating estrogen levels following menopause. Studies have shown, however, that estrogen replacement therapies in post-menopausal women do not consistently reduce the risk of AD. While menopause and estrogen levels are potential factors in the elevated incidence rates of AD among women, this review highlights the possible roles estrogen has in other pathways that may also contribute to the sex disparity observed in AD such as olfaction, sleep, and glymphatic functionality.

39218292|t|Improvement of olfactory function in AD mice mediated by immune responses under 40 Hz light flickering.
39218292|a|BACKGROUND: 40 Hz light flickering has shown promise as a non-invasive therapeutic approach for alleviating both pathological features and cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice and AD patients. Additionally, vision may influence olfactory function through cross-modal sensory interactions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of 40 Hz light flickering on olfactory behavior in AD model mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms of this intervention. METHODS: We used immunofluorescence techniques to observe the activation of the olfactory bulb (OB) in C57BL/6J mice under 40 Hz light flickering. A buried food test was conducted to evaluate olfactory behavior in AD mice. Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology was employed to detect transcriptional alterations in the OBs of AD mice following light stimulation. RESULTS: 40 Hz light flickering was found to effectively activate the OB. This stimulation led to enhanced olfactory behavior and did not alter P-tau protein mRNA levels within the OBs of AD mice. RNA sequencing revealed significant transcriptional changes in the OBs under flickering, particularly related to immune responses. CONCLUSION: Vision can influence olfactory function through cross-modal sensory interactions in rodent models. 40 Hz light stimulation improved olfactory performance in AD mice. However, the improvement in olfaction in AD mice is not related to changes in P-tau mRNA levels. Instead, it may be associated with an altered immune response, providing a scientific basis for the clinical treatment of olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease.

39284855|t|Genomic study of taste perception genes in African Americans reveals SNPs linked to Alzheimer's disease.
39284855|a|While previous research has shown the potential links between taste perception pathways and brain-related conditions, the area involving Alzheimer's disease remains incompletely understood. Taste perception involves neurotransmitter signaling, including serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine. Disruptions in these pathways are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. The integration of olfactory and taste signals in flavor perception may impact brain health, evident in olfactory dysfunction as an early symptom in neurodegenerative conditions. Shared immune response and inflammatory pathways may contribute to the association between altered taste perception and conditions like neurodegeneration, present in Alzheimer's disease. This study consists of an exploration of expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL), utilizing whole-blood transcriptome profiles, of 28 taste perception genes, from a combined cohort of 475 African American subjects. This comprehensive dataset was subsequently intersected with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Finally, the investigation delved into assessing the association between eQTLs reported in GWAS of AD and the profiles of 741 proteins from the Olink Neurological Panel. The eQTL analysis unveiled 3,547 statistically significant SNP-Gene associations, involving 412 distinct SNPs that spanned all 28 taste genes. In 17 GWAS studies encompassing various traits, a total of 14 SNPs associated with 12 genes were identified, with three SNPs consistently linked to Alzheimer's disease across four GWAS studies. All three SNPs demonstrated significant associations with the down-regulation of TAS2R41, and two of them were additionally associated with the down-regulation of TAS2R60. In the subsequent pQTL analysis, two of the SNPs linked to TAS2R41 and TAS2R60 genes (rs117771145 and rs10228407) were correlated with the upregulation of two proteins, namely EPHB6 and ADGRB3. Our investigation introduces a new perspective to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing the significance of bitter taste receptor genes in its pathogenesis. These discoveries set the stage for subsequent research to delve into these receptors as promising avenues for both intervention and diagnosis. Nevertheless, the translation of these genetic insights into clinical practice requires a more profound understanding of the implicated pathways and their pertinence to the disease's progression across diverse populations.

987158|a|Monozygotic twin sisters developed Parkinson's disease and anosmia at the age of 39. The disease was kept under control and regressed with L. Dopa. Two families with the same association had been previously reported. An anomaly of the metabolism of dopamine, genetically determined, is probably responsible for these disorders.

1776739|t|Olfactory capacities in aging and Alzheimer's disease. Psychophysical and anatomic considerations.
1776739|a|Age-related alterations in the ability to smell are well documented. For example, more than three-fourths of individuals over the age of 80 have major difficulty detecting and identifying odors. Furthermore, olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, the olfactory pathways of patients with AD evidence disproportionate numbers of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles relative to other sensory pathways, suggesting that the olfactory system may be the site of first involvement of the AD process. In this article, the literature related to age- and AD-related alterations in olfactory perception has been briefly reviewed, and several current hypotheses regarding the physiologic basis for these changes discussed.

1929775|t|Temporal and hippocampal metabolic rate during an olfactory memory task assessed by positron emission tomography in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and controls. Preliminary studies.
1929775|a|Positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 was used to assess cortical metabolic rate during an olfactory memory task in six patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. Metabolic activity was compared with that of both age-matched controls performing the olfactory task and controls resting with their eyes closed. Patients had lower metabolic rates in the anterior portion of the medial-temporal cortex than did controls, and the difference was greatest between patients and the controls performing the memory task. This region is known to receive a large olfactory input and has been implicated in the encoding of human memory. Normal controls resting with their eyes closed had significantly lower metabolic rates in this area when compared with normal controls performing the task. Our results are consistent with those of earlier reports of temporal lobe decreases in metabolic rate and extend them through the examination of areas salient to the behavioral loss.

6463130|t|Development of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test: a standardized microencapsulated test of olfactory function.
6463130|a|The development of the first standardized "scratch 'n sniff" olfactory test is described. Over 1600 subjects participated in five experiments. In Experiment 1, 50 microencapsulated odorants were rated as to their intensity, pleasantness, irritation, coolness, and familiarity, and two procedures for releasing them were compared. In Experiment 2, the results of the first experiment and other data were used in the development of the test, which was administered to a large number of subjects. Using multiple regression analysis, scores on this test were shown to be significantly related to the subjects' gender, ethnic background, and smoking behavior. Average test scores decreased as a function of age, with the greatest decline occurring between the sixth and tenth decades of life. These age-related changes were not correlated with scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale. Women performed better than men within all age categories. In Experiment 3, the test was shown to differentiate between subjects with known olfactory disorders (e.g., Kallmann's syndrome; Korsakoff's syndrome) and normal controls, and to reliably detect persons instructed to feign total anosmia. In Experiment 4, the test-retest reliability was established (6-month interval; r = 0.918, p less than 0.001), and in Experiment 5 the test was shown to correlate thresholds with odor detection (r = -0.794, p less than 0.001). This self-administratered test now makes it possible to rapidly and accurately assess general olfactory function in the laboratory, clinic, or through the mail without complex equipment or space-consuming stores of chemicals.

9613727|t|Clinical assessment of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
9613727|a|We used two simple tasks to test the capacities of patients with Parkinson's disease to discriminate and identify olfactory stimuli. The patients presented defective odor identification abilities whereas their capacity to discriminate between odors was apparently unaffected. This raises a question about the nature of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Further clinical data is required for analysis of this dysfunction. We therefore propose simple and rapid tests appropriate for clinical use with Parkinson's disease patients.

9855521|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Guamanian ALS, parkinsonism, and dementia.
9855521|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess whether olfactory deficits are present in the general Guamanian Chamorro population and to evaluate olfaction in each of the four neurodegenerative disease syndromes of Guam: ALS, pure parkinsonism, pure dementia, and the combined parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC). BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction was previously reported in patients with PDC of Guam. METHODS: We developed a culturally adjusted olfactory test battery, derived from the original University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), and administered this to Chamorro residents with ALS (n=9), pure parkinsonism (n=9), pure dementia (n=11), PDC (n=31), and 53 neurologically normal Chamorro and 25 North American control subjects. RESULTS: Similar, marked olfactory dysfunction was found in all four syndromes of Guamanian neurodegenerative disease. This correlated poorly with measures of parkinsonism and cognition. In the neurologically normal Chamorro control group, six subjects (11%) had very low olfactory scores; these were less than the lowest North American score, raising a question of subclinical neurodegenerative disease. CONCLUSIONS: Marked olfactory deficits are common to all four Guamanian neurodegenerative syndromes, and suggest the possibility of similar central neuropathologic substrates. The deficit in the Guamanian ALS group contrasts with idiopathic ALS, in which olfactory function has been reported to be only slightly compromised.

10078723|t|Abnormal performance on the PD test battery by asymptomatic first-degree relatives.
10078723|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a sensitive and specific battery of tests (PD Battery) could identify a subset of asymptomatic first-degree relatives (FDRs) of PD patients who were significantly more impaired than age-matched normal control (NC) subjects. The PD Battery incorporates tests of motor function, olfaction, and mood. In previous studies, it has shown high specificity and sensitivity in distinguishing mildly affected PD patients from NC subjects. METHODS: The PD Battery and regression analysis-derived scoring equations were applied to asymptomatic FDRs. RESULTS: Eighty FDRs and 100 NC subjects were tested. Of the FDRs, 22.5% scored in the abnormal range, and 9% of NC subjects had abnormal scores. This difference was statistically significant. Further analysis demonstrated that FDRs with abnormal scores on the PD Battery differed on all three components of the test battery from FDRs who had normal scores. Among the sons and daughters whose scores were abnormal, there was a much higher prevalence of the affected parent being the father. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of FDRs who demonstrated abnormal performance on the PD Battery was greater than that of NC subjects. Thus, the PD Battery may detect the asymptomatic carrier state or risk for PD. Sons and daughters whose scores were in the abnormal range were more likely to have fathers with PD.

12876469|t|Olfactory dysfunction in hereditary ataxia and basal ganglia disorders.
12876469|a|In the present study the olfactory system of hereditary ataxia patients was tested using the smell identification test. Two previous findings suggested a possible olfactory impairment in these patients. First, an olfactory dysfunction has been found in different neurodegenerative diseases, and second, human functional imaging has shown cerebellar activation during olfaction. As an initial approach to determine if cerebellar ataxia impairs the olfactory process, cerebellar ataxia patients, along with basal ganglia patients, were tested. The results show an olfactory deficit in both basal ganglia and hereditary ataxia patients. Further exploration of the olfactory capacities in hereditary ataxia is necessary to elucidate the specific nature of the deficits.

15023103|t|Odour identification as a marker for postoperative cognitive dysfunction: a pilot study.
15023103|a|The onset of postoperative cognitive dysfunction is delayed in some elderly surgical patients and the condition may persist. Increasing age is a risk factor for both postoperative cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Major surgery may unmask an underlying dementia; we report findings of a pilot study designed to inform this hypothesis. Impaired odour identification ability is a characteristic of the preclinical phase of some neuro-degenerative diseases. This pilot study was designed to establish whether odour identification deficit is a marker for postoperative cognitive dysfunction, particularly in elderly patients genetically predisposed to develop late-onset Alzheimer's disease. We found no association between odour identification ability and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in 53 patients aged 62-86, undergoing major non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Our pilot study showed that a high number of patients genetically predisposed to develop Alzheimer's disease is required to test the utility of odour identification as a marker for postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

15044757|t|The flavor of aging.
15044757|a|The ability to smell and taste breaks down with age, diminishing quality of life and impeding good nutrition. Researchers are beginning to understand why these senses falter.

15079034|a|The authors studied whether olfactory dysfunction is present in parkin disease using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The mean UPSIT score in parkin patients was 27.3 (95% CI 24.4 to 30.2). This did not differ from the normal group mean of 29.4 (95% CI 28.0 to 30.7; p = 0.22) but was higher than the Parkinson disease group (mean 14.3; 95% CI 12.2 to 19.5; p < 0.0001) and the parkin-negative group (mean 17.1; 95% CI 14.8 to 16.3; p < 0.0001) values. Parkin disease may be a distinct and separate entity from Parkinson disease.

15181375|t|Olfactory response in the temporal cortex of the elderly measured with near-infrared spectroscopy: a preliminary feasibility study.
15181375|a|The pathway for the olfactory response may be affected at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Measurement of the olfactory response in the elderly is therefore of particular interest. In this feasibility study, near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure the olfactory response in 21 patients aged 56 to 79 years. Eight subjects had no memory complaints whereas 13 had subjective memory complaints, mild cognitive impairment, or very mild Alzheimer's disease. The optodes were placed over the temporal lobe, with the emitting optode over the pole and the receiving optode over the superior gyrus. The response to vanilla (1% in sterile H2O) in a test tube held immediately beneath the nostrils was compared to the response to sterile H2O only. Four control subjects had a clearly definable response with increased oxyhemoglobin and decreased deoxyhemoglobin bilaterally. The response was measured as the sum of the deviation of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin from baseline mean. With a cut-off determined after examination of responses to vanilla and sham stimulus, group difference was significant for response to vanilla (chi2 test, P = 0.03). Response amplitudes to vanilla in the patient group were within the range of those to sham stimuli.

15390014|t|Detection of presymptomatic Parkinson's disease: combining smell tests, transcranial sonography, and SPECT.
15390014|a|Olfactory loss is among the early signs of Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated whether "idiopathic" olfactory dysfunction might relate to signs of nigral degeneration. Olfactory tests were combined with transcranial sonography of the substantia nigra and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Thirty patients diagnosed with idiopathic olfactory loss participated. Eleven of these patients exhibited an increased echogenicity of the SN in the transcranial sonography. In 10 of these 11 patients, SPECT scans with (123)I-FP-CIT were performed. Median uptake ratios in the basal ganglia were pathological in 5 patients, 2 patients exhibited borderline findings, and 3 patients had normal results. Considering patients with idiopathic olfactory dysfunction, noninvasive transcranial sonography seems to be helpful in identifying patients potentially at risk to develop PD. Longitudinal follow-up studies are necessary to estimate the ratio of patients with dopaminergic cell loss in the basal ganglia who will develop PD in the future.

17017547|t|Detection of preclinical Parkinson's disease along the olfactory trac(t).
17017547|a|The association of Parkinson's disease (PD) with an impaired sense of smell was first reported about thirty years ago. Since then, it has become quite firmly established that olfactory dysfunction is one of the first and most prevalent clinical manifestations of this disorder. Recent data from an ongoing prospective study indicate that otherwise unexplained hyposmia in first degree relatives of patients with sporadic PD is associated with an increased risk of developing clinical PD of at least 13%. In particular, a combination of impaired olfactory function and reduced striatal [123I]beta-CIT binding on a baseline SPECT scan appears to be a strong predictor of a subsequent diagnosis of PD. Pathological studies support these observations by demonstrating that the anterior olfactory structures may be one of the induction sites of PD pathology. Considering that there is a doubling rather than a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb in PD patients, the pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD is far from being elucidated. Studying prodromal manifestations of PD, such as olfactory dysfunction, and their underlying pathophysiology may greatly contribute to the development of treatment strategies that focus on preclinical detection and slowing down disease progression.

17681839|t|The premotor phase of Parkinson's disease.
17681839|a|There is growing evidence that a variety of symptoms can precede the classical motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The period when these symptoms arise can be referred to as the premotor phase of the disease. Well-documented premotor symptoms in PD include constipation, loss of smell, sleep disturbances such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and mood disturbances like depression. Diagnostic and therapeutic implications linked to improved identification of these premotor features are discussed.

17854836|t|Variability in the clinical expression of Parkinson's disease.
17854836|a|Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by bradykinesia, hypo-/akinesia, muscular rigidity, and resting tremor, mainly caused by Parkinson's disease (PD). Symptoms of PD are due to a progressive loss of nigral neurons causing striatal dopaminergic denervation. However, nigral degeneration is only a part of the underlying synucleinopathy, and clinical symptoms go far beyond motor parkinsonism. Olfactory disturbances, fatigue, pain, autonomic dysfunction, sleep fragmentation, depression, and dementia with or without psychosis are frequently seen. The variability in the expression of these signs and symptoms, as discussed in this paper, might be explained by the specific topographical sequence of the pathology, depending on the extent and progression of the degenerative process at defined sites. Better insight in the clinicopathological correlations of this disease may help to further develop early diagnosis and adequate therapeutic strategies.

17960810|t|Parkinson's disease and aging: same or different process?
17960810|a|Parkinson's disease (PD), which probably commences in the olfactory bulb and nuclei of IX and X, may represent accelerated normal aging or a disease specific process. The olfactory and motor disorders are associated in PD, so that smell loss should reflect the underlying disease course. Information on age-associated decline can be obtained by single measurement from cross-sectional analysis of patients and controls of different ages, because the observed between-subject picture may reflect a similar within-subject pattern. University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) scores were examined for aging effects in 263 controls and 266 PD patients. Three models were applied that are (a) simple linear regression and (b) quadratic term in age: (i) assuming two parallel curves and (ii) allowing for two separate curves. Both groups declined with age. All three models were fitted successfully to the cross-sectional data and none suggested that the lower mean UPSIT score in patients compared to controls was a premature ageing effect. The mean PD-UPSIT score even at the age of 40, was lower than the control mean at the upper life-span limit, implied that the decline in olfaction in PD is faster than simple aging. Extrapolation back in time suggested onset before birth, which is unlikely and implies that at some point there is a more rapid decline than observed in this sample. On the basis of olfactory measurement, our data are consistent with the proposal that PD starts as an acute event, followed by further disease progression more rapid than simple aging.

18267240|t|Olfaction in Parkinson's disease.
18267240|a|It has become increasingly apparent that Parkinson's disease (PD) can no longer be considered purely a motor disease, as numerous sensory alterations accompany this disorder either before or early in its clinical progression. Most notable among such disturbances are decrements in smell function. Such anomalies have been documented in approximately 90% of patients with early-stage sporadic PD and appear to progress little, if at all, with the development of the more classic PD-related motor symptoms. In this paper, I briefly review the nature of the olfactory dysfunction observed in PD and current theories as to its pathological basis.

18304749|t|Acquisition of conditioned taste aversion is impaired in the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
18304749|a|Research into the underlying mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has relied traditionally on tasks such as the water maze which evaluate spatial learning and memory. Since non-spatial forms of memory are also disrupted by AD, it is critical to establish other paradigms capable of investigating these deficits. Utilizing a non-spatial learning task, acquisition of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) was evaluated in a mouse model of AD. This line of transgenic mice encode a mutated allele of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) genes and exhibit extensive amyloid plaque deposition in the brain by 6-7 mo of age. Compared with wild-type mice, 10-17 month old APP/PS1 mice failed to acquire CTA to saccharin. Mice that only possessed one of the two mutations were able to acquire CTA to the saccharin. In 2-5 month old APP/PS1 mice acquisition of CTA was disrupted despite the lack of extensive plaque deposition. However, further analysis indicated a potential gender difference in both the CTA deficit and onset of plaque deposition with females showing greater conditioned aversion.

18718805|t|A clinical, neuropsychological and olfactory evaluation of a large family with LRRK2 mutations.
18718805|a|We evaluated the neurological and neuropsychological profiles and olfaction as presymptomatic markers in a large family with Parkinson disease (PD) caused by the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. Five affected family members, 14 asymptomatic mutation carriers and 15 non-carriers were compared. Patients had typical dopa-responsive PD, frequently associated with cognitive impairment. Asymptomatic carriers and non-carriers could not be distinguished because of their neuropsychological status, the presence of depression or olfactory impairment. We were therefore unable to identify a presymptomatic marker of LRRK2-related PD.

18759359|t|The prodromal phase of sporadic Parkinson's disease: does it exist and if so how long is it?
18759359|a|It is frequently assumed that idiopathic Parkinson's disease starts with several nonmotor symptoms and signs, but the evidence for this stage in the disease process is of variable quality. This review evaluates the more robust prospective or pathologically confirmed publications to establish whether there is a premotor period and if so what is its duration. The most informative studies are considered to be those concerned with olfaction, dysautonomia, and sleep disorder. Estimates for the duration of the prodromal phase vary from months to decades. It is concluded that there probably is an early phase in the disease where a variety of nonmotor features develop, but the sequence and time of onset of such features is not well established.

18787880|t|Early Parkinson's disease and non-motor issues.
18787880|a|Non motor symptoms (NMS) of PD are a key determinant of health, quality of life and societal cost of PD. Contrary to common perception, many NMS of PD occur early in PD and some may even predate the diagnosis of PD which is based on motor signs. These include olfactory deficit, sleep problems such as REM behaviour disorder, contipation and the more recently described male erectile dysfunction. The non motor quesionnaire (NMSQuest) and the recently validated NMS scale allow falgging and quantification of NMS of PD and therefore are important tools to comprehensively assess symptom load in PD.

18838952|t|Neuroimaging of nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease.
18838952|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms that respond to dopaminergic therapy. However, there is increasing interest in nonmotor PD features such as hyposmia, sleep disorders, dementia, depression, and psychoses. We review neuroimaging studies in nonmotor symptoms of PD and the use of dopaminergic imaging to support screening of nonmotor symptoms for early PD. Neuroimaging data document nonmotor pathophysiologic involvement of systems beyond the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. These neuroimaging studies support a broader view of PD with early involvement in time and wider involvement of monoamine and cortical systems that may provide targets for novel therapies for nonmotor symptoms.

19201246|t|Olfactory dysfunction in pure autonomic failure: Implications for the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases.
19201246|a|BACKGROUND: Pure autonomic failure (PAF) and Parkinson disease (PD) both are Lewy body diseases, and both entail substantia nigra dopaminergic, locus ceruleus noradrenergic, and cardiac sympathetic denervation. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a non-Lewy body disease in which alpha-synuclein accumulates in glial cells, with central catecholamine deficiency but preserved cardiac sympathetic innervation in most patients. PD is associated with more severe and consistent olfactory dysfunction than in MSA; whether PAF entails olfactory dysfunction has been unknown. In this study we assessed olfactory function in PAF in comparison with the two other synucleinopathies and whether olfactory dysfunction correlates with neuroimaging evidence of cardiac noradrenergic or nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. METHOD: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was administered to 8 patients with PAF, 23 with PD, and 20 with MSA. 6-[(18)F]Fluorodopamine positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning was used to indicate cardiac noradrenergic innervation and the putamen:occipital cortex (PUT:OCC) and substantia nigra (SN):OCC ratios of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa-derived radioactivity to indicate nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation. RESULTS: The PAF group had a low mean UPSIT score (22+/-3), similar to that in PD (20+/-2) and lower than in MSA (31+/-2, p=0.004). Individual UPSIT scores correlated positively with cardiac 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity (r=0.63 in the septum, p<0.0001; r=0.64 in the free wall, p<0.0001) but not with PUT:OCC or SN:OCC ratios of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa-derived radioactivity. DISCUSSION: In synucleinopathies, olfactory dysfunction is related to Lewy body pathology and cardiac sympathetic denervation, independently of parkinsonism or striatal dopamine deficiency.

19221310|t|Can we image premotor Parkinson disease?
19221310|a|Pathology and imaging studies have shown that patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have a prolonged period of uncertain duration when vulnerable neuronal populations are degenerating, but typical motor symptoms have not yet developed. This provides both an opportunity-it may be best to test new medications and, ultimately, treat PD patients during this early phase of disease--and a challenge--how to find these premotor PD subjects? Imaging biomarkers targeting the premotor period are critical to elucidate both the onset and progression of premotor PD. Widespread data have demonstrated that dopaminergic imaging can detect PD subjects at the motor symptom threshold. Novel strategies combining dopaminergic imaging with known genetic mutations for PD or early clinical signs and PD-associated symptoms, such as olfactory loss and sleep disturbances like REM behavior disorder, have begun to be used to identify individuals at risk for PD before motor symptoms become manifest. Early studies also have used imaging targeting norepinephrine, serotonin, cholinergic, or other neuronal systems to focus on early cardiac, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Imaging of nondopaminergic targets such as inflammation or alpha-synuclein deposition may provide further insight into the etiology of PD. Given the multiple genetic etiologies for PD already identified, the marked variability in the loss of dopaminergic markers measured by imaging at motor symptom onset, and the clear heterogeneity of clinical symptoms at PD onset, it is certain that many imaging biomarkers with a focus ranging from clinical symptoms to PD pathobiology to molecular genetic mechanisms, will be necessary to fully map PD risk.

19433741|t|Hyposmia in pure autonomic failure.
19433741|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and pure autonomic failure (PAF) all present with varying degrees of dysautonomia and are pathologically characterized by accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Hyposmia and olfactory pathway pathology are found in PD and MSA. We tested odor identification in 16 patients with PAF and compared the results with those found in patients with PD, patients with MSA, and control subjects. METHODS: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was used to evaluate the sense of smell in 16 patients with PAF, 14 patients with MSA, 191 patients with PD, and 145 control subjects. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of the diseases on the mean UPSIT score when adjusted for age, sex, and smoking habit. RESULTS: The mean UPSIT score was higher in the controls than in patients with PAF (p < 0.001) or MSA (p < 0.001); it was lower in patients with PD than in patients with PAF (p = 0.005) or patients with MSA (p = 0.006); and no difference was found between patients with MSA and patients with PAF (p = 0.9) when adjusted for age, gender, and smoking habits. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia may be a feature of pure autonomic failure (PAF), but to a lesser degree than that found in Parkinson disease. Further research into the olfactory pathways in patients with PAF is warranted.

19686207|t|Olfaction in aging and Alzheimer's disease: event-related potentials to a cross-modal odor-recognition memory task discriminate ApoE epsilon4+ and ApoE epsilon 4- individuals.
19686207|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that affects more than 5 million Americans. Currently, a definitive and unequivocal diagnosis of AD can only be confirmed histopathogically via postmortem autopsy, demonstrating the need for objective measures of cognitive functioning for those at risk for AD. The single most important genetic risk factor of AD is the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele. The present study investigated olfactory and cognitive processing deficits in ApoE epsilon4(+) individuals using a cross-modal recognition memory task and an objective electrophysiological measure, the event-related potential (ERP). Ten epsilon4(+) individuals (5 M, 5 F, mean [M]= 75.1 years) and 10 age- and gender-matched epsilon4(-) individuals (5 M, 5 F, M = 71 years) sequentially encoded a set of 16 olfactory stimuli and were subsequently shown names of odors previously presented (targets) or not (foils). EEG activity was recorded from 19 electrodes as participants distinguished targets from foils using a two-button mouse. P3 latencies were significantly longer in epsilon4(+) individuals, and intraclass correlations demonstrated differential activity between the two groups. These findings are consistent with a compensatory hypothesis, which posits that nondemented epsilon4(+) individuals will expend greater effort in cognitive processing or engage in alternative strategies and therefore require greater activation of neural tissue or recruitment of different neural populations. The findings also suggest that cross-modal ERP studies of recognition memory discriminate early neurocognitive changes in ApoE epsilon4(+) and ApoE epsilon4(-) individuals and may contribute to identifying the phenotype of persons who will develop Alzheimer's disease.

19951136|t|Olfactory dysfunction as a diagnostic marker for Parkinson's disease.
19951136|a|There is evidence from numerous studies, using both psychophysical and electrophysiological approaches, that impairment of olfaction is a characteristic and early feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Deficits in the sense of smell may precede clinical motor symptoms by years and can be used to assess risk for developing PD in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Recent data indicate that over 95% of patients with PD present with significant olfactory loss. Thus, olfactory dysfunction should be considered a reliable marker of the disease. This review summarizes the available information about olfactory function in PD, indicating the advantageous use of olfactory probes in early and differential diagnosis.

20007465|t|Olfactory impairment predicts brain atrophy in Parkinson's disease.
20007465|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent nonmotor symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and may be considered as an early clinical feature of the disease preceding motor symptoms by years. According to recent neuropathological staging concepts, impaired olfaction is assumed to indicate an early pathological process and might be associated with structural changes in the brain. A morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance images [voxel-based morphometry (VBM)] was used to investigate gray matter atrophy related to psychophysically measured scores of olfactory function in early PD patients (n = 15, median Hoehn and Yahr stage 1.5), moderately advanced PD patients (n = 12, median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 17). In PD patients, but not in controls, cortical atrophy in olfactory-related brain regions correlated specifically with olfactory dysfunction. Positive correlations between olfactory performance and gray matter volume were observed in the right piriform cortex in early PD patients and in the right amygdala in moderately advanced patients. The results provided first evidence that olfactory dysfunction in PD is related to atrophy in olfactory-eloquent regions of the limbic and paralimbic cortex. In addition, olfactory-correlated atrophy in these brain regions is consistent with the assumption that olfactory impairment as an early symptom of PD is likely to be associated with extranigral pathology.

20082967|t|Predicting Parkinson's disease - why, when, and how?
20082967|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder with a presymptomatic interval; that is, there is a period during which the pathologic process has begun, but motor signs required for the clinical diagnosis are absent. There is considerable interest in discovering markers to diagnose this preclinical stage. Current predictive marker development stems mainly from two principles; first, that pathologic processes occur in lower brainstem regions before substantia nigra involvement and second, that redundancy and compensatory responses cause symptoms to emerge only after advanced degeneration. Decreased olfaction has recently been demonstrated to predict PD in prospective pathologic studies, although the lead time may be relatively short and the positive predictive value and specificity are low. Screening patients for depression and personality changes, autonomic symptoms, subtle motor dysfunction on quantitative testing, sleepiness and insomnia are other potential simple markers. More invasive measures such as detailed autonomic testing, cardiac MIBG-scintigraphy, transcranial ultrasound, and dopaminergic functional imaging may be especially useful in those at high risk or for further defining risk in those identified through primary screening. Despite intriguing leads, direct testing of preclinical markers has been limited, mainly because there is no reliable way to identify preclinical disease. Idiopathic RBD is characterized by loss of normal atonia with REM sleep. Approximately 50% of affected individuals will develop PD or dementia within 10 years. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to test potential predictive markers before clinical disease onset. The results of marker testing in idiopathic RBD with its implications for disease prediction will be detailed.

20187248|t|Parkinson's at risk syndrome: can Parkinson's disease be predicted?
20187248|a|The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) has revolved around pharmacologic interventions that primarily treat the cardinal (dopaminergic) manifestations of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia; yet, we now know that the pathology of PD is widespread, accounting for more disabling symptoms such as cognitive impairment, autonomic problems, and postural instability. Further, attempts at modifying PD may be hampered as much by the imperfection of therapeutic interventions as by the extent of neuronal damage that exists even in early PD, when most putative neuroprotective agents are tried. Our approach to PD must therefore evolve and include strategies for detecting PD earlier in its course and, eventually, intervening when the disease process is in its nascent stages. Parkinson's associated risk syndrome (PARS) is the term we have coined to describe patients at risk for developing PD. These patients may have genetic risk factors or may have subtle, early non-motor symptoms including abnormalities in olfaction, gastrointestinal function, cardiac imaging, vision, behavior, and cognition. Changes in neuroimaging modalities can predict the emergence of neurologic signs and symptoms within several years. The PARS study is now underway to determine the feasibility of screening a large cohort of subjects to identify those at highest risk for developing PD. If successful, we will have the tools to identify cohorts for clinical trials of PD prevention or, at the very least, delay of disease onset, and long-term disability. Further, our concept of PD risk will change the nosology of PD as those now considered "at-risk" may ultimately be considered to already have the disease.

20438207|t|Semantic networks for odors and colors in Alzheimer's disease.
20438207|a|OBJECTIVE: Impairment in odor-naming ability and in verbal and visual semantic networks raised the hypothesis of a breakdown in the semantic network for odors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study addressed this hypothesis. METHOD: Twenty-four individuals, half patients with probable AD and half control participants, performed triadic-similarity judgments for odors and colors, separately, which, utilizing the multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique of individual difference scaling analysis (INDSCAL), generated two-dimensional configurations of similarity. The abilities to match odors and colors with written name labels were assessed to investigate disease-related differences in ability to identify and conceptualize the stimuli. In addition, responses on attribute-sorting tasks, requiring the odor and color perceptions to be categorized as one polarity of a certain dimension, were obtained to allow for objective interpretation of the MDS spatial maps. RESULTS: Whereas comparison subjects generated spatial maps based predominantly on relatively abstract characteristics, patients with AD classified odors on perceptual characteristics. The maps for patients with AD also showed disorganized groupings and loose associations between odors. Their normal configurations for colors imply that the patients were able to comprehend the task per se. The data for label matching and for attribute sorting provide further evidence for a disturbance in semantic odor memory in AD. The patients performed poorer than controls on both these odor tasks, implying that the ability to identify and/or conceptualize odors is impaired in AD. CONCLUSION: The results provide clear evidence for deterioration of the structure of semantic knowledge for odors in AD.

20464295|t|Olfactory function and Parkinson's disease in Southern Brazil.
20464295|a|UNLABELLED: The idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) is traditionally diagnosed by motor signs, but non-motor symptoms and signs are frequent and may help in the clinical diagnosis. PURPOSE: To evaluate the olfactory function in Brazilian healthy subjects, patients with early-onset PD (EOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD) using the Sniffin' Sticks odor-identification test (SST). METHOD: We studied 70 patients with IPD (19 EOPD and 51 LOPD) and 70 controls matched for gender, age and years of schooling. Subjects with dementia and loss of smell for other reasons were excluded. RESULTS: The SST showed a significant difference (p<0.001) between groups: control groups (12.0 + or - 0.3), EOPD (8.3 + or - 0.7), and LOPD (6.7 + or - 0.4) when the groups were adjusted for gender, age, disease duration, and years of schooling. CONCLUSION: Both groups of IPD patients presented olfactory impairments, but those whose symptoms started before 45 years-old (EOPD) had better sense of smell than the LOPD patients.

20724290|t|Disruption of odour quality coding in piriform cortex mediates olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
20724290|a|Patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease exhibit perceptual deficits in odour identification, often before the appearance of overt memory loss. This impairment coincides with the initial accumulation of pathological lesions in limbic olfactory brain regions. Although these data imply that odour stimuli may be effectively used as biological probes of limbic dysfunction, the precise neural mechanisms underlying the olfactory deficits in early Alzheimer's disease remain poorly understood. In the current study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with an olfactory cross-adaptation paradigm to test the hypothesis that perceptual codes of odour quality in posterior piriform cortex are degraded in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In elderly control subjects, sequential presentation of qualitatively similar (versus qualitatively different) odourant pairs elicited cross-adapting responses in posterior piriform cortex, in accord with the pattern observed in healthy young adults. However, this profile was significantly blunted in patients with Alzheimer's disease, reflecting a functional disruption of odour quality coding in this olfactory brain area. These results highlight the potential of olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging as a non-invasive bioassay of limbic functional integrity, and suggest that such an index could possibly aid in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, as a putative lesion model of odour quality processing in the human brain, our study suggests a causal role of posterior piriform cortex in differentiating olfactory objects.

20870956|t|Olfactory performance in AD, aMCI, and healthy ageing: a unirhinal approach.
20870956|a|Olfactory dysfunction constitutes one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been shown in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Whether the severity of olfactory impairments in aMCI patients parallels those in AD has not been clearly established. In addition, given reports of asymmetries in neuropathological burden in early AD, functional asymmetries in olfactory performance may enhance early detection if olfactory function is assessed unirhinally. We compared AD, aMCI, and healthy participants on olfactory identification and memory assessed unirhinally. Olfactory identification was most proficient in the healthy participants and least proficient in AD, although this disparity did not depend on nostril side. Nevertheless, when only the worst nostril of each participant was included in the analysis, aMCI patients outperformed their AD counterparts. In contrast, when only the best nostril of each participant was included in the analysis--often regarded as an estimate of birhinal performance--this difference between aMCI and AD dissipated. Olfactory memory did not differ significantly across the groups, perhaps reflecting a floor effect. The findings support the hypothesis that unirhinal olfactory assessment may assist in differentiating between demented and nondemented individuals.

21055449|t|Inducible dopaminergic glutathione depletion in an alpha-synuclein transgenic mouse model results in age-related olfactory dysfunction.
21055449|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) involves both motor and non-motor disturbances. Non-motor features include alterations in sensory olfactory function which may constitute a viable biomarker for the disorder. It is not clear what causes olfactory dysfunction but it appears to coincide with the development of synucleopathy within the olfactory bulb (OB). Elevation in alpha-synuclein (a-syn) is indeed a risk factor for development of the sporadic disorder. The multifactorial nature of the idiopathic disease combined with variability in its presentation suggests that it is likely to be influenced by several factors and that in vivo models that explore the synergistic effect of alpha-synuclein elevation with other potential contributing factors are likely to be of importance in understanding the disease etiology. Using a dual transgenic (DTg) mouse model of dopaminergic alpha-synuclein overexpression coupled with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible glutathione (GSH) depletion in these same cells, we demonstrate an age-related loss in behavioral olfactory function coupled with a significant neurodegeneration of glomerular dopaminergic neurons. This is accompanied by increase in alpha-synuclein levels in non-dopaminergic cells in the granule cell layer (GCL). In addition, isolated olfactory bulb synaptosomes from dual transgenic lines with Dox consistently showed a slight but significant reduction in maximum mitochondrial respiration compared to controls. These results suggest that in the presence of increased oxidative stress, increased alpha-synuclein expression within dopaminergic OB neurons results in neurodegeneration in the glomerular layer (GL) and increased alpha-synuclein levels in the granular cell layer which coincide with olfactory dysfunction.

21367642|t|Clinical correlates of olfactory dysfunction in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.
21367642|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a very common and early sign in neurodegenerative disorders, but few data are already available in hereditary ataxias. Our aim was to evaluate the sense of smell in patients with molecular-proven spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Forty-one patients with SCA3 and 46 control subjects were studied. The sense of smell was tested using the Sniffin's Sticks (SS-16). We also evaluated Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and non-cerebellar symptoms, such as parkinsonism, dystonia, and restless legs syndrome (RLS). The SCA3 group had significantly lower SS-16 scores than controls (11.5 +- 2.4 vs 12.8 +- 1.5, p = 0.003). Multiple linear regression analyses, controlling for age, sex, education, cigarette smoking, and MMSE scores, showed that SCA3 (p = 0.021), sex (p = 0.003) and MMSE scores (p = 0.002) had significant regression coefficients. All the variables taken together were significantly associated with the SS-16 scores (p <= 0.001). Although MMSE scores and female sex were stronger predictors of the SS-16 scores than SCA3, subjects with SCA3 had lower scores on the SS-16, regardless of sex or MMSE scores. Additionally, MMSE scores, sex and presence of RLS were the best predictors of SS-16 scores. Overall, our results strengthen that the sense of smell is significantly reduced in patients with SCA3 and that sex, MMSE scores and RLS also influence the SS-16 scores.

21658728|t|Neuropsychological correlates of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
21658728|a|Olfactory impairment is a common early non-motor manifestation in Parkinson's disease that has garnered interest as a clinical biomarker for early "pre-motor" diagnosis and prediction of associated clinical phenotypes. Whether olfactory impairment correlates well with motor symptoms is not yet clear, and recent interest has focused on the relationship between hyposmia and other non-motor symptoms. In this paper, we will review emerging evidence for a relationship between hyposmia and neuropsychiatric manifestations, discussing the potential pathophysiology together with challenges and opportunities for future research.

21753159|t|Olfactory dysfunction in LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers.
21753159|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is an established nonmotor feature of idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD), which may precede disease onset. Olfaction is likely disturbed in patients with PD with leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) G2019S mutations, although the degree of impairment is debated. It is also unclear whether mutation carriers who have not yet manifested with PD have olfactory disturbances. METHODS: Thirty-one subjects with LRRK2 G2019S mutation-related PD (PD-manifesting carriers [PD-MC]), 30 subjects with PD without mutations (PD noncarriers [PD-NC]), 28 mutation carrier family members (nonmanifesting carriers [NMC]), and 46 controls completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Generalized estimating equations were applied to determine whether olfactory score was associated with PD and LRRK2 mutation status. RESULTS: As expected, having PD was associated with impaired olfaction regardless of LRRK2 mutation status. More importantly, however, impaired olfaction was increased overall in LRRK2 carriers both with and without PD, though the impairment was only present in a subset of NMCs. Compared to controls, the mean score was lower among NMC (difference = -3.518, p = 0.006), MC (difference = -7.677, p < 0.0001), and idiopathic PD (PD-NC) (difference = -13.810, p < 0.0001). Olfaction was better among MC (PD-MC) than non-LRRK2 PD (PD-NC) (difference = 6.13, p = 0.0012). Group differences from the continuous analysis were maintained in dichotomous analysis stratifying at 15th percentile for age and gender. CONCLUSION: Olfaction is impaired in LRRK2 G2019S-mutation related PD, although less overall than other PD. Further, olfaction is impaired in a subset of LRRK2 NMC, suggesting that olfaction may be a marker for development of PD in this group, and that longitudinal studies are warranted.

22102296|t|Functional connectivity during recognition memory in individuals genetically at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
22102296|a|The medial temporal lobes (MTL) and frontal cortex have been shown to subserve memory processes. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), disrupt the neuronal networks that underlie memory processing. The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is a genetic risk factor for AD and is associated with decrements in memory and in olfactory function. The present study utilized EQS, a structural equation modeling software program, to examine differences in the neuronal networks between non-demented epsilon4 carriers and epsilon4 noncarriers during a cross-modal olfactory recognition memory paradigm. Prior to fMRI scanning, participants were presented with 16 odors. During two scans, participants discriminated between names of odors presented before scanning (targets) or not presented (foils). The results indicate significant connections between bilateral frontal lobes and MTL for epsilon4 carriers when they misidentified a foil as a target. When epsilon4 noncarriers correctly identified a target, there were greater associations between the amygdala, MTL, and right frontal lobe; these associations also modeled the brain's response when epsilon4 noncarriers misidentified a foil as a target. During memory retrieval, affective cues may facilitate retrieval in epsilon4 noncarriers relative to epsilon4 carriers. Last, no model was found that best represented the functional network used by epsilon4 carriers when they correctly identified a target, which may reflect variability of neuronal recruitment within this population.

22362921|t|Value of combined midbrain sonography, olfactory and motor function assessment in the differential diagnosis of early Parkinson's disease.
22362921|a|OBJECTIVE: Characteristic features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are asymmetric parkinsonian motor signs, hyposmia and substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity on transcranial ultrasound. However, each of these features has limited diagnostic value as they may be present, albeit less frequently, in other parkinsonian disorders. Here, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of combined assessment of these three features are evaluated. METHODS: 632 patients with parkinsonism (PD, vascular parkinsonism, atypical parkinsonian syndromes, essential tremor and major depressive disorder with motor slowing) were assessed on the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale for motor asymmetry (right-left score difference >=2), the 12 item Sniffin' Sticks test (SS-12) and transcranial ultrasound. The derivation (validation) cohort consisted of 517 (115) subjects (193 (35) women; age 65.4+-9.6 (62.3+-10.3) years) of whom 385 (68) had PD and 132 (47) non-PD parkinsonism; another 21 (6) subjects were not included due to missing transcranial insonability. Of the validation cohort, all patients had a disease duration <=2 years and observers were blind to diagnoses. RESULTS: The optimum cut-off values for discrimination of PD were SS-12 score <8 (hyposmia) and SN echogenic size >=0.24 cm(2) (SN hyperechogenicity). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values for the diagnosis of PD were as follows, for the derivation cohort: motor asymmetry 88%, 54% and 85%; hyposmia 75%, 70% and 88%; SN hyperechogenicity 90%, 63% and 88%; two features present 96%, 72% and 91%; three features present 57%, 94% and 97%; and for the validation cohort: two features present 91%, 77% and 85%; three features present 49%, 98% and 97%. CONCLUSION: The combined assessment of motor asymmetry, hyposmia and SN hyperechogenicity improves diagnostic specificity and allows early diagnosis of PD.

22843227|t|Comparison study of olfactory function and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder, Parkinson's disease and normal control.
22843227|a|Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a preclinical feature of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD).This study aimed to investigate the presence of potential early manifestations of parkinsonism, such as olfactory dysfunction and substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, in idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients, PD patients and normal controls. We performed an olfactory function test using the cross-cultural smell identification test (CC-SIT) and midbrain transcranial sonography (TCS) in 15 patients with iRBD as confirmed by polysomnography, 30 patients with PD, and 30 normal controls. The CC-SIT scores of the iRBD patients and PD patients were significantly lower than those of the normal controls and similar between iRBD and PD (mean +- SD, 7.1 +- 2.2 and 7.6 +- 2.4 vs. 10.4 +- 1.2, respectively, p < 0.01). The sum of bilateral SN echosignals in the iRBD patients was greater than that of the normal controls but lower than that of the PD patients (0.29 +- 0.47, 0.11 +- 0.17 and 0.72 +- 0.41 cm(2), respectively, p < 0.01). In conclusion, we found that the concomitant abnormality of olfaction and increased SN echogenicity was more frequent in iRBD compared with normal control. Olfactory dysfunction and SN hyperechogenicity could be preclinical manifestations of parkinsonism in iRBD patients.

23042214|t|Evidence for early cognitive impairment related to frontal cortex in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
23042214|a|The frontal cortex is a brain structure that plays an important role in cognition and is known to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. Over the past years, transgenic mouse models have been generated to recapitulate the main features of this disease, including cognitive impairments. This study investigates frontal cortex dependent learning abilities in one of the most early-onset transgenic murine model of AD, the 5XFAD mice. We compared frontal performance of 2-, 4-, and 6-month-old 5XFAD mice with their wild-type littermates using a newly developed automated device, the olfactory H-maze, in which mice have to discover three different rules consecutively according to the delayed reaction paradigm. We report early cognitive deficits related to frontal cortex appearing in 4-month-old 5XFAD mice before hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment, in relation with neuropathologic processes such as strong gliosis and emerging amyloid plaques. The present results demonstrate that the olfactory H-maze is a very sensitive and simple experimental paradigm that allows assessment of frontal functions in transgenic mice and should be useful to test pre-clinical therapeutic approaches to alter the course of AD.

23881622|t|Parkinson disease and sleep: sleep-wake changes in the premotor stage of Parkinson disease; impaired olfaction and other prodromal features.
23881622|a|Parkinson disease (PD) has a premotor stage where neurodegeneration occurs before parkinsonism becomes apparent. Identification of individuals at this stage provides an opportunity to study early disease progression and test disease-modifying interventions. Hyposmia, constipation, depression and hypersomnia are part of this premotor phase and predictive of future development of PD. However, these features are common in the general population, and they are most often the result of causes other than incipient PD. In contrast, most individuals with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) eventually develop PD and other synucleinopathies. IRBD individuals with hyposmia, substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, and abnormal striatal dopamine transporter imaging findings have increased short-term risk of developing a synucleinopathy. IRBD is an optimal target to test disease-modifying agents in the PD prodromal phase. Serial dopamine transporter imaging, but not olfactory tests, may serve to monitor the disease process in future disease-modifying trials in IRBD.

23939442|t|MRI diffusion in Parkinson's disease: using the technique's inherent directional information to study the olfactory bulb and substantia nigra.
23939442|a|Pathological studies have shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) at early stages affects the olfactory bulb (OB) followed by an involvement of substantia nigra (SN) and other brain regions. Emerging imaging methodologies detect alterations in certain brain regions of living PD patients, which may support proper diagnosis and monitor disease progression. Here we used a novel approach of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), taking advantage of the technique's inherent diffusion directional information, for region of interest (ROI) placement and diffusion measurements in the OB and SN. 16 healthy individuals and 18 early-moderate patients with PD, supported by reduced 123I-Ioflupane putaminal binding, were examined with two identical DTI series. Olfaction was assessed with the 40-item UPSIT and Parkinsonian severity with UPDRS and Hoehn&Yahr. DTI measurements showed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) for SN in the PD group in both DTI series. In OBs there was reduced FA in the PD group in the first series, but not in the second. As OBs are located in an area susceptible to artifacts, the coefficient of variation between the two DTI series was higher than for other brain regions. The UPSIT scores were much lower in the PD group than in healthy individuals. In conclusion, we describe a novel approach for more objective ROI placement in DTI, which enabled us to detect altered diffusion in the SN and OBs in PD. These data provides further support that diffusion MRI can be of high clinical utility as a biomarker to facilitate diagnosis and follow disease progression in PD.

23948901|t|Expression of Alzheimer-like pathological human tau induces a behavioral motor and olfactory learning deficit in Drosophila melanogaster.
23948901|a|A key characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies is the progressive accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. In the present study, we use transgenic Drosophila melanogaster as a model to analyze in vivo the effect of expressing pseudophosphorylated tau (S199E/T212E/T231E/S262E tau) on pathological human tau (PH-tau) and on the FTDP-17 mutant R406W (PH-tauR406W). We used two different inducers that produced different levels of tau expression. The expression of these forms of tau did not significantly affect the lifespan of the flies. Flies expressing PH-tau displayed a clear locomotor dysfunction compared to those expressing normal tau regardless of the level of expression. At lower level of expression, this pathological phenotype was found to be age-dependent. At 35 days old, PH-tau flies showed the strongest locomotor impairment compare to flies expressing human tau or control flies (46%, 18% and 18% of flies remained on the bottom of the vials, respectively). At higher levels of expression, PH-tau flies showed these defects at seven days of age and the dysfunction also became significant for flies expressing tauR406W and PH-tauR406W. Whole brain immunochemistry analysis revealed that PH-tau as well as PH-tauR406W appeared to have abnormal mushroom body structures, critical structures involved in olfactory learning and memory in Drosophila. Severe olfactory learning deficits were induced by the expression of PH-tau. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PH-tau induced a toxic effect in Drosophila, as flies develop both an abnormal motor deficit, associated with disruption of the mushroom body neurons, and impaired olfactory learning.

23985416|t|Therapeutic effect of exogenous hsp70 in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
23985416|a|Brain deterioration resulting from "protein folding" diseases, such as the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the aging human population. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) constitute the major cellular quality control system for proteins that mitigates the pathological burden of neurotoxic protein fibrils and aggregates. However, the therapeutic effect of Hsps has not been tested in a relevant setting. Here we report the dramatic neuroprotective effect of recombinant human Hsp70 in the bilateral olfactory bulbectomy model (OBX mice) and 5XFAD mouse models of neurodegeneration. We show that intranasally-administered Hsp70 rapidly enters the afflicted brain regions and mitigates multiple AD-like morphological and cognitive abnormalities observed in model animals. In particular, in both cases it normalizes the density of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex which correlates with the diminished accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and, in the case of 5XFAD mice, reduces Abeta plaque formation. Consistently, Hsp70 treatment also protects spatial memory in OBX and 5XFAD mice. These studies demonstrate that exogenous Hsp70 may be a practical therapeutic agent for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal protein biogenesis and cognitive disturbances, such as AD, for which neuroprotective therapy is urgently needed.

24262869|t|Olfactory performance acts as a cognitive reserve in non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease.
24262869|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore whether olfactory performance acts as a cognitive reserve in non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Patients with non-demented PD (n = 119) underwent T1-weighted MRI and olfactory identification tests. According to their olfactory performance, PD patients were subdivided into three groups of high score (PD-H, n = 38), middle score (PD-M, n = 48), and low score (PD-L, n = 33). We investigated the pattern of gray matter (GM) density according to olfactory performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and analyzed the correlation between GM density and olfactory performance. RESULTS: No significant differences in demographic characteristics were observed among the groups. A neuropsychological test showed that cognitive deficits in verbal memory function were more severe in the PD-L group than in the PD-H group. However, a VBM analysis revealed that patients in the PD-H group possessed significantly decreased GM density in the bilateral temporal areas, orbitofrontal areas, mesiofrontal areas extending into the cingulate gyrus, and prefrontal areas, compared with patients in the PD-L group. No areas exhibiting a significant difference in GM density were observed between the PD-H and PD-M groups. Olfactory performance in patients with PD was negatively correlated with both the brain GM volume and intracerebral volume; in particular, GM density in the caudate nucleus and putamen exhibited a negative correlation with olfactory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that a high olfactory performance may compensate GM volume loss in order to minimize the exhibition of cognitive impairment and thus may act as a cognitive reserve in non-demented patients with PD.

24291850|t|[Non-motor symptoms in premotor phase of Parkinson disease].
24291850|a|Non-motor symptoms are common in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD), and some even predate the emergence of the classic motor features. The premotor phase of PD is characterized by several important non-motor features, including constipation, olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, etc. The basis of this prodromal stage is that the pathological process related to Lewy bodies, may start outside of the substantia nigra. We investigated 469 Japanese PD patients in our multicenter study, using the Japanese version of the RBD screening questionnaire. Probable RBD was detected in 146 patients (31%) and the RBD symptoms of 53 patients preceded the onset of PD motor symptoms. With the probable exception of RBD, non-motor clinical markers can be sensitive for an impending diagnosis of PD, but these features are common and non-specific. The combination of non-motor clinical markers and more specific markers (e.g., imaging or genetic markers) may achieve sufficient utility in PD diagnosis and prediction in future. Being able to diagnose that a patient has PD at an earlier time point than is currently possible, would be allowed to introduce potential disease-modifying therapies at a time when it could have fundamental and long-lasting effects.

24796234|t|Application of the University Of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (traditional Chinese version) for detecting olfactory deficits in early Parkinson's disease in a Taiwanese cohort.
24796234|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a non-motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that appears at an early stage. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is the most widely used test for olfactory dysfunction, with multiple language versions available, including one in Traditional Chinese (UPSIT-TC). However, the UPSIT-TC has rarely been applied to the elderly population or patients with PD in Taiwan. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to establish normative data in a Taiwanese cohort and evaluate the efficacy of the UPSIT-TC for detecting olfactory deficits in early PD. METHODS: The UPSIT-TC was administered to 161 healthy Taiwanese subjects divided into four age groups: 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years. Furthermore, 30 patients with PD with less than 2 years disease duration were examined with the UPSIT-TC. RESULTS: The normative data from this cohort were lower than expected, deviating from North American norms by 2.5 to 5 points. The deviation was more prominent with advanced age. The PD group had a significantly lower mean UPSIT-TC score than the age- and gender-matched control group (p < 0.0001). With a cutoff score of 29.5, the sensitivity and specificity of the UPSIT-TC for the diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction in early PD was 86% and 70%, respectively. The subjects with PD, advanced age, and shorter education had significantly lower UPSIT-TC scores (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The UPSIT-TC effectively detected hyposmia in early PD in the Taiwanese cohort. Despite the modification of UPSIT-TC items, a discrepancy was found between the Taiwanese and North American norms.

25040401|t|Amyloid-abeta Peptide in olfactory mucosa and mesenchymal stromal cells of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients.
25040401|a|Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) might develop olfactory dysfunction that correlates with progression of disease. Alteration of olfactory neuroepithelium associated with MCI may be useful as predictor of cognitive decline. Biomarkers with higher sensitivity and specificity would allow to understand the biological progression of the pathology in association with the clinical course of the disease. In this study, magnetic resonance images, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) load, Olfactory Connecticut test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) indices were obtained from noncognitive impaired (NCI), MCI and AD patients. We established a culture of patient-derived olfactory stromal cells from biopsies of olfactory mucosa (OM) to test whether biological properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are concurrent with MCI and AD psychophysical pathology. We determined the expression of amyloid Abeta peptides in the neuroepithelium of tissue sections from MCI and AD, as well as in cultured cells of OM. Reduced migration and proliferation of stromal (CD90(+) ) cells in MCI and AD with respect to NCI patients was determined. A higher proportion of anosmic MCI and AD cases were concurrent with the ApoE epsilon4 allele. In summary, dysmetabolism of amyloid was concurrent with migration and proliferation impairment of patient-derived stem cells.

25298306|t|Imaging prodromal Parkinson disease: the Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome Study.
25298306|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative risk of abnormal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging for subjects with and without hyposmia and the feasibility of acquiring a large, community-based, 2-tiered biomarker assessment strategy to detect prodromal Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: In this observational study, individuals without a diagnosis of PD, recruited through 16 movement disorder clinics, underwent tier 1 assessments (olfactory testing, questionnaires). Tier 2 assessments (neurologic examination, DAT imaging, and other biomarker assessments) were completed by 303 subjects. The main outcome of the study is to compare age-expected [(123)I]beta-CIT striatal binding ratio in hyposmic and normosmic subjects. RESULTS: Tier 1 assessments were mailed to 9,398 eligible subjects and returned by 4,999; 669 were hyposmic. Three hundred three subjects (203 hyposmic, 100 normosmic) completed baseline evaluations. DAT deficit was present in 11% of hyposmic subjects compared with 1% of normosmic subjects. Multiple logistic regression demonstrates hyposmia (odds ratio [OR] 12.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6, 96.1), male sex (OR 5.5; 95% CI 1.7, 17.2), and constipation (OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.6, 11.6) as factors predictive of DAT deficit. Combining multiple factors (hyposmia, male sex, and constipation) increased the percentage of subjects with a DAT deficit to >40%. CONCLUSION: Subjects with DAT deficit who do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of PD can be identified by olfactory testing. Sequential biomarker assessment may identify those at risk of PD. Selecting hyposmic individuals enriches the population for DAT deficit, and combining hyposmia with other potential risk factors (male sex, constipation) increases the percentage of subjects with a DAT deficit compatible with prodromal PD.

25449044|t|The onset of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (the ONSET PD study).
25449044|a|Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) can precede onset of motor symptoms. Relationship between premotor symptoms onset and motor features is limited. Our aim is to describe the presence and perceived onset of NMS in PD as well as their possible association with motor phenotype. Presence and onset of NMS were assessed by a custom-made questionnaire in 109 newly diagnosed untreated PD patients and 107 controls from 11 Spanish and Austrian centers. Seventeen of thirty-one NMS were more common in patients than controls (P < 0.05). They were usually mild and frequently reported to occur at different time-spans before motor symptoms. Anhedonia, apathy, memory complaints, and inattention occurred more frequently during the 2-year premotor period. Those reported more frequently in the 2- to 10-year premotor period were smell loss, mood disturbances, taste loss, excessive sweating, fatigue, and pain. Constipation, dream-enacting behavior, excessive daytime sleepiness, and postprandial fullness were frequently perceived more than 10 years before motor symptoms. No correlation between NMS burden and motor severity, age, or gender was observed. NMS associated in four clusters: rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder symptoms-constipation, cognition-related, mood-related, and sensory clusters. No cluster was associated with a specific motor phenotype or severity. NMS are common in early unmedicated PD and frequently reported to occur in the premotor period. They are generally mild, but a patient subgroup showed high NMS burden mainly resulting from cognition-related symptoms. Certain NMS when present at the time of assessment or in the premotor stage, either alone or in combination, allowed discriminating PD from controls.

25571305|t|Parkinson's disease detection using olfactory loss and REM sleep disorder features.
25571305|a|In Parkinson's disease, there exists a prodromal or a premotor phase characterized by symptoms like olfactory loss and sleep disorders, which may last for years or even decades before the onset of motor clinical symptoms. Diagnostic tools based on machine learning using these features can be very useful as they have the potential in early diagnosis of the disease. In the paper, we use olfactory loss feature from 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and Sleep behavior disorder feature from Rapid eye movement sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) database, to develop automated diagnostic models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and classification tree methods. The advantage of using UPSIT and RBDSQ is that they are quick, cheap, and can be self-administered. Results show that the models performed with high accuracy and sensitivity, and that they have the potential to aid in early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

25787809|t|Transcranial sonography and the pocket smell test in the differential diagnosis between parkinson's disease and essential tremor.
25787809|a|The aim of this study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of transcranial sonography (TCS) and the Pocket Smell Test (PST) in differing Parkinson's disease from essential tremor. The results were compared with the dopamin transporter scan (DaTSCAN) findings. Based on the DaTSCAN finding we formed a group of patients with essential tremor (51 patients) and a group with the Parkinson's disease (59 patients). The control group consisted of 26 healthy one. To evaluate the olfactory dysfunction the PST was used, whereas by TCS the substantia nigra hyperechogenicity was marked. The sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic method was statistically calculated. In confirming Parkinson's disease the specificity of TCS was 88.2 % and the sensitivity 94.9 %. The specificity of PST was 80.4 % whereas the sensitivity was 74.6 %. TCS and PST should be performed to evaluate which patients need to be examined by DaTSCAN.

25925983|t|Potential sex differences in nonmotor symptoms in early drug-naive Parkinson disease.
25925983|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine potential sex differences in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) among drug-naive patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and to identify NMS that can best differentiate patients with early PD from controls. METHODS: Our cross-sectional analysis included 414 newly diagnosed, untreated patients with PD (269 men and 145 women) and 188 healthy controls (121 men and 67 women) in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Study. NMS were measured using well-validated instruments covering sleep, olfactory, neurobehavioral, autonomic, and neuropsychological domains. RESULTS: Male and female patients with PD were fairly comparable on motor presentations but differed on several nonmotor features. Male patients with PD had significantly more pronounced deficits in olfaction (p = 0.02) and in certain cognitive measurements (all p < 0.01) than female patients, whereas female cases experienced higher trait anxiety (p = 0.02). Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the combination of NMS measures-University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT), and state anxiety from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-effectively differentiated patients with PD from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.94). UPSIT, MoCA, and SCOPA-AUT were the most predictive NMS measurements in men (AUC = 0.919; 95% CI: 0.89-0.95) as compared to UPSIT, MoCA, and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire in women (AUC = 0.903; 95% CI: 0.86-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed notable sex differences in several nonmotor features of patients with de novo PD. Furthermore, we found a parsimonious NMS combination that could effectively differentiate de novo cases from healthy controls.

26096632|t|Olfactory Dysfunction Evaluation Is Not Affected by Comorbid Depression in Parkinson's Disease.
26096632|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory function assessment is an important screening tool for Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis. It is debated whether olfaction is affected by comorbid depression. We assessed the relationship between depression and olfaction in PD and determined whether depression may limit the usefulness of olfactory testing for PD diagnosis. METHODS: Olfaction was evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks test and the Hyposmia Rating Scale in four groups of subjects: PD patients without depression (n = 30); PD patients with major depression (PDD; n = 30); major depressive disorder (MDD) patients (n = 29); and healthy controls (HCs; n = 30). RESULTS: No differences were found between PD and PDD patients for total Sniffin' Sticks test, threshold, discrimination or identification scores, or in Hyposmia Rating Scale, although both groups differed from HCs and MDD patients (P < 0.05), which, in turn, showed similar olfactory scores. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of differences in olfactory impairment between PD and PDD suggest that depression may not contribute to olfactory dysfunction in PD.

26224038|t|Early Parkinson's disease patients on rasagiline present with better odor discrimination.
26224038|a|The effects of rasagiline on olfaction in animal studies are convincing. However, apart from various anecdotal patient reports, they could not be reproduced in prospective studies in humans. Cross-sectional data of large patient groups are still missing. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the olfactory function in a broad heterogeneous Parkinson's disease (PD) population with and without rasagiline intake. In this single-center, cross-sectional study 224 PD patients with and without rasagiline (1 mg/day) participated. Seventy-four of them received rasagiline as mono, or adjunct therapy. One-hundred fifty patients were untreated or received PD medication other than rasagiline. Comprehensive olfactory testing was performed for phenyl-ethyl alcohol odor thresholds, odor discrimination, and odor identification. Olfactory function did not differ between the two treatment groups with disease duration up to 29 years. Rasagiline-treated patients with disease duration of less than 8 years, however, presented with significant better odor discrimination abilities compared to PD patients without rasagiline treatment. This effect was no longer evident in patients with longer disease duration and proofed to be independent of age, sex, and medication. Our results may suggest that rasagiline treatment has a positive effect on the processing of olfactory information in early PD.

26627940|t|From sweet to sweat: Hedonic olfactory range is impaired in Parkinson's disease.
26627940|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction and neuropsychological symptoms like depression and anhedonia are common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The assessment of both functional domains includes clinical examination, olfactory testing, and standardized questionnaires. While olfaction is readily assessed by functional tests, the distinction of anhedonia as a separate symptom from other depressive symptoms is challenging. Thus, a test focusing on the assessment of hedonic olfaction may be helpful in the assessment of neuropsychological symptoms in PD. METHODS: We examined anhedonia by evaluating the perception of pleasantness of odors in PD patients (n = 57) and healthy controls (n = 46). Pleasantness of odors was registered on a visual 9-point scale. For the assessment of anhedonia we used the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Depression was evaluated with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory II. RESULTS: PD patients showed a substantial reduction in hedonic olfaction compared to controls (hedonic score: 1.5 vs. 2.2). Hyposmia, one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in PD, was a confounding factor. However, even normosmic PD patients showed a reduced hedonic olfaction compared to controls (hedonic score: 1.6 vs. 2.2). Furthermore, we observed a correlation between hedonic olfaction and the SHAPS-score for PD patients even though positive SHAPS-rating was observed in 9% of PD patients only, while no correlation to depression was present. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that reduced hedonic olfaction might be an additional neuropsychological feature, probably giving insights into changes in hedonic tone complementary to hyposmia and depression in PD.

27003780|t|Variation in Recent Onset Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Prodromal Detection.
27003780|a|BACKGROUND: The detection of prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) is desirable to test drugs with neuroprotective potential, but will be affected by known disease variations. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of four key non-motor prodromal PD markers, and evaluate the sensitivity of case detection when non-motor screening tools for prodromal PD are implemented in an early clinical PD cohort. METHODS: Hyposmia (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test <=15th centile or Sniffin' Sticks at or <=10th centile corrected for age and sex), rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD questionnaire >4), constipation (<1 daily spontaneous bowel motion) and depression (Leeds >6) were recorded in recent onset PD cases, and proposed non-motor screening criteria applied. RESULTS: In 1,719 PD cases, mean age 68.6 years (SD 8.1), 65.5% male, mean disease duration 1.3 years (SD 0.9), 72.2% were hyposmic, 43.3% had RBD, 22.1% depression, and 21.5% constipation. 11.6% of cases had no key non-motor features, 38.8% one, 32.1% two, 15.5% three, and 2.0% all four. Increasing numbers of non-motor features were associated with younger age (p = 0.019), higher motor scores (p < 0.001), more postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) (p < 0.001), greater cognitive impairment (p < 0.001) and higher total non-motor burden (p < 0.001). Cases with hyposmia alone were younger (p < 0.001), had less severe cognitive (p = 0.006) and other non-motor features (p < 0.001). All screening criteria selected younger patients (p = 0.001, p < 0.001), three of four greater overall non-motor burden (p = 0.005, p < 0.001), and inclusion of RBD more cognitive impairment (p = 0.003, p = 0.001) and PIGD (p = 0.004, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Varying sensitivity levels, and age and phenotype selectivity, are found when different non-motor screening methods to detect prodromal PD are applied to an early clinical PD cohort.

27678208|t|New test of odor pleasantness in Parkinson's disease.
27678208|a|The New Test of Odor Pleasantness (NTOP) evaluates the hedonicity of olfactory stimulants. The aim of this study was to compare results of the NTOP, the Sniffin' Sticks test, and the Odorized Marker Test (OMT) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study sample comprised 30 PD patients (mean age 71+-7.36 years) and the control group made up of 31 non-PD subjects (mean age 68+-12.39 years). Sociodemographic data, medical history and tests of cognitive function were investigated. Olfaction was evaluated using the NTOP, Sniffin' Sticks test and OMT. The PD patients, compared with the control group, recorded significantly lower scores on all three tests: NTOP (p=0.00), Sniffin' Sticks (p=0.02), OMT (p=0.00). The NTOP was the test preferred by 55% of the subjects. This preference was more marked in the PD group. This study shows that the NTOP is a valuable method within the complex array of olfactory screening tools used in PD.

28004533|t|New olfactometric findings in Parkinson's disease.
28004533|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate in Parkinson's disease-affected patients a correlation between hyposmia and gastrointestinal dysfunction and their possible identical etiopathogenesis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: ENT and neurology departments (Gemelli Hospital, Rome, Italy). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 78 patients with diagnosis of PD according to the UK Brain Bank criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: informed consent and olfactory testing executed; exclusion criteria: signs of dementia according to the DSM-IV criteria; Mini Mental State Examination score <=26; head trauma; central neurological disorders, nasal or systemic diseases potentially affecting olfactory function. Motor condition was assessed by means of Hoehn and Yahr staging and by section III of the Unified PD Rating Scale, performed off and on medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patients underwent olfactory evaluation (TDI score), after rhinomanometry with nasal decongestion. A total of 25 non-motor symptoms were evaluated through an interview. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction was objectively found in 91.0% of patients, a percentage higher than the subjective hyposmia reported (55.1%) P = 0.0001. Seven patients (9.0%) were normosmic, 49 (62.8%) hyposmic and 22 (28.2%) anosmic. Subjective hyposmia, constipation, bloating and dyspepsia differed across groups, being higher in anosmic and hyposmic ones than in the normosmic group. P value was <=0.05 for each symptom. Despite the original results, this study has the limitation of being based on subjective ratings by a relatively limited group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia and gastrointestinal symptoms are correlated, and this would support a possible common origin; the CNS could be reached through two different pathways, both starting in the peripheral nervous system.

28039314|t|Olfaction and risk of dementia in a biracial cohort of older adults.
28039314|a|OBJECTIVE: Prior studies indicate that olfactory function may be an early marker for cognitive impairment, but the body of evidence has been largely restricted to white populations. METHODS: We studied 2,428 community-dwelling black and white older adults (baseline age 70-79 years) without dementia enrolled in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. Olfaction was measured as odor identification (OI) with the 12-item Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test in year 3. We defined incident dementia over 12 years on the basis of hospitalization records, prescription for dementia medication, or 1.5-SD decline in race-stratified global cognition score. We assessed dementia risk associated with OI score (by tertile) using Cox proportional hazards models. All analyses were stratified by race. RESULTS: Poorer OI in older adults without dementia was associated with increased risk of dementia. After adjustment for demographics, medical comorbidities, and lifestyle characteristics, white participants in the poor or moderate OI tertile had greater risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45-4.54; and HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.33-2.54, respectively) compared to those in the good tertile of function. Among blacks, worse OI was associated with an increased risk of dementia, but the magnitude of the effect was weaker (p for interaction = 0.04) for the poor OI tertile (adjusted HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.44-2.84) and for the moderate tertile (adjusted HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.97-2.10). There was no interaction between OI and APOE epsilon4 and risk of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: While the magnitude of the association was stronger in whites, we found that poor OI was associated with increased risk of dementia among both black and white older adults.

28734065|t|FDG PET, dopamine transporter SPECT, and olfaction: Combining biomarkers in REM sleep behavior disorder.
28734065|a|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder is a prodromal stage of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Hyposmia, reduced dopamine transporter binding, and expression of the brain metabolic PD-related pattern were each associated with increased risk of conversion to PD. The objective of this study was to study the relationship between the PD-related pattern, dopamine transporter binding, and olfaction in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 21 idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder subjects underwent 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, dopamine transporter imaging, and olfactory testing. For reference, we included 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET data of 19 controls, 20 PD patients, and 22 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. PD-related pattern expression z-scores were computed from all PET scans. RESULTS: PD-related pattern expression was higher in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder subjects compared with controls (P = 0.048), but lower compared with PD (P = 0.001) and dementia with Lewy bodies (P < 0.0001). PD-related pattern expression was higher in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder subjects with hyposmia and in subjects with an abnormal dopamine transporter scan (P < 0.05, uncorrected). CONCLUSION: PD-related pattern expression, dopamine transporter binding, and olfaction may provide complementary information for predicting phenoconversion.   2017 The Authors.

28776303|t|Premotor Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.
28776303|a|Typical Parkinsonian symptoms consist of bradykinesia plus rigidity and/or resting tremor. Some time later postural instability occurs. Pre-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, constipation, REM sleep behavior disorder and depression may antecede these motor symptoms for years. It would be ideal, if we had a biomarker which would allow to predict who with one or two of these pre-motor symptoms will develop the movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, it is interesting to learn that biopsies of the submandibular gland or colon biopsies may be a means to predict PD, if there is a high amout of abnormally folded alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. This would be of relevance if we would have available means to stop the propagation of abnormal alpha-synuclein which is otherwise one of the reasons of this spreading disease PD.

28802920|t|Neuropathology of Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease.
28802920|a|Parkinson's disease (PD), a multiorgan neurodegenerative disorder associated with alpha-synuclein deposits throughout the nervous system and many organs, is clinically characterized by motor and nonmotor features, many of the latter antedating motor dysfunctions by 20 or more years. The causes of the nonmotor manifestations such as olfactory, autonomic, sensory, neuropsychiatric, visuospatial, sleep, and other disorders are unlikely to be related to single lesions. They are mediated by the involvement of both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic systems, and diverse structures outside the nigrostriatal system that is mainly responsible for the motor features of PD. The nonmotor alterations appear in early/prodromal stages of the disease and its further progression, suggesting a topographical and chronological spread of the lesions. This lends further support for the notion that PD is a multiorgan proteinopathy, although the exact relationship between presymptomatic and later developing nonmotor features of PD and neuropathology awaits further elucidation.

29017573|t|Gad67 haploinsufficiency reduces amyloid pathology and rescues olfactory memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
29017573|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. Although dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitter systems including cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems has been associated with AD progression the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We and others have recently found that GABA content is elevated in AD brains and linked to cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. The glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) is the major enzyme converting glutamate into GABA and has been implied in a number of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. However, whether Gad67 is involved in AD pathology has not been well studied. Here, we investigate the functional role of GAD67 in an AD mouse model with Gad67 haploinsufficiency that is caused by replacing one allele of Gad67 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene during generation of GAD67-GFP mice. METHODS: To genetically reduce GAD67 in AD mouse brains, we crossed the Gad67 haploinsufficient mice (GAD67-GFP+/-) with 5xFAD mice (harboring 5 human familial AD mutations in APP and PS1 genes) to generate a new line of bigenic mice. Immunostaining, ELISA, electrophysiology and behavior test were applied to compare the difference between groups. RESULTS: We found that reduction of GAD67 resulted in a significant decrease of amyloid beta production in 5xFAD mice. Concurrently, the abnormal astrocytic GABA and tonic GABA currents, as well as the microglial reactivity were significantly reduced in the 5xFAD mice with Gad67 haploinsufficiency. Importantly, the olfactory memory deficit of 5xFAD mice was rescued by Gad67 haploinsufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that GAD67 plays an important role in AD pathology, suggesting that GAD67 may be a potential drug target for modulating the progress of AD.

29082509|t|Combining olfactory test and motion analysis sensors in Parkinson's disease preclinical diagnosis: a pilot study.
29082509|a|OBJECTIVES: Preclinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is nowadays a topic of interest as the neuropathological process could begin years before the appearance of motor symptoms. Several symptoms, among them hyposmia, could precede motor features in PD. In the preclinical phase of PD, a subclinical reduction in motor skills is highly likely. In this pilot study, we investigate a step-by-step method to achieve preclinical PD diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the IOIT (Italian Olfactory Identification Test) to screen a population of healthy subjects. We identified 20 subjects with idiopathic hyposmia. Hyposmic subjects underwent an evaluation of motor skills, at baseline and after 1 year, using motion analysis sensors previously created by us. RESULTS: One subject showed significant worsening in motor measurements. In this subject, we further conducted a dopaminergic challenge test monitored with the same sensors and, finally, he underwent [123 I]-FP/CIT (DaTscan) SPECT brain imaging. The results show that he is probably affected by preclinical PD. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that the combined use of an olfactory test and motor sensors for motion analysis could be useful for a screening of healthy subjects to identify those at a high risk of developing PD.

29922950|t|Olfactory Function in SCA10.
29922950|a|Although the main clinical manifestations of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) result from damage of the cerebellum, other systems may also be involved. Olfactory deficits have been reported in other types of ataxias, especially in SCA3; however, there are no studies on olfactory deficits in SCA type 10 (SCA10). To analyze olfactory function of SCA10 patients compared with that of SCA3, Parkinson's, and healthy controls. Olfactory identification was tested in three groups of 30 patients (SCA10, SCA3, and Parkinson's disease (PD)) and 44 healthy controls using the Sniffin' Sticks (SS16) test. Mean SS16 score was 11.9 +- 2.9 for the SCA10 group, 12.3 +- 1.9 for the SCA3 group, 6.6 +- 2.8 for the PD group, and 12.1 +- 2.0 for the control group. Mean SS16 score for the SCA10 group was not significantly different from the scores for the SCA3 and control groups but was significantly higher than the score for the PD group (p < 0.001) when adjusted for age, gender, and history of smoking. There was no association between SS16 scores and disease duration in the SCA10 or SCA3 groups or number of repeat expansions. SS16 and Mini Mental State Examination scores were correlated in the three groups: SCA10 group (r = 0.59, p = 0.001), SCA3 group (r = 0.50, p = 0.005), and control group (r = 0.40, p = 0.007). We found no significant olfactory deficits in SCA10 in this large series.

30452411|t|Impact of Olfactory Priming on Food Intake in an Alzheimer's Disease Unit.
30452411|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often associated with feeding difficulties and changes in eating behavior with may lead to malnutrition. In French nursing homes, AD patients may live in special care units that better meet dementia residents' needs. However, meals are often delivered to AD patients by using meal trays coming from central kitchens. This led to the disappearance of cues that could help residents to foresee mealtime, such as the smell of food odors. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of odorizing the dining room of AD Units with a meat odor before lunch on subsequent food intake and eating behavior. Thirty-two residents (>75 years old) from three AD Units were included in the study. They participated in two control lunches and two primed lunches, for which a meat odor was diffused in the dining room 15 minutes before the arrival of the meal tray (olfactory priming). Results of the first replication showed a significant effect of olfactory priming, with a 25% increase in meat and vegetable consumption compared to the control condition. Behavioral measurements also showed a significant increase of resident's interest toward the meal in the primed lunch. However, this effect was no longer observed when the priming session was replicated two weeks later with the same priming odor and the same menu. Although further research is needed to understand why this priming effect cannot be replicated, our experiment is one of the very first to investigate the effect of food odor priming on subsequent food intake in AD patients in a real-life setting.

30945913|t|Awareness of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
30945913|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory impairment is a very common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, individuals often overestimate their ability to smell. Hyposmia and metacognitive errors are also related to aging, depression, male gender and cognitive impairment. The current study investigated the awareness of olfactory functioning in PD and the influence of additional factors. METHOD: A sample of 124 nondemented PD patients and 154 elderly controls was assessed with the Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test (OIT) and the Subjective Olfactory Capability (SOC) domain of the Assessment of Self-Reported Olfactory Functioning and Olfaction-Related Quality of Life, additional to measures of depressive symptoms, verbal memory and executive functioning. Olfactory awareness groups were formed by means of the cut-offs of the OIT and the SOC. RESULTS: Significant correlations between the OIT and the SOC were moderate in participants with PD and small in controls. Of all PD patients, 52% overrated their sense of smell while 27% correctly identified themselves as being hyposmic, as opposed to corresponding 6% and 1% of healthy elderly. Overrating and aware of being hyposmic participants with PD showed worse executive functions than PD patients who were objectively and subjectively normosmic. CONCLUSIONS: The findings imply that, although people with PD are aware of hyposmia to some extent, the majority is affected by overestimation of the ability to smell, making self-reported functioning an unreliable source of information. Moreover, reduced odor identification and impaired executive functioning might underlie the same pathological changes within the brain and could serve as a marker for cognitive impairment in PD.

31407692|t|[Approaches to early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease].
31407692|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a long period of 'latent' course of the neurodegenerative process. Non-motor symptoms, including behavioral dysfunction in the REM sleep phase, hyposmia, constipation, depression, may be detected in patients before the development of movement disorders. The combination of these manifestations can be used to identify the risk group for the subsequent development of PD. These patients can be further investigated using biomarkers. Dopamine receptor agonists are the first-choice drugs at the onset of disease, providing correction of not only motor, but also non-motor symptoms.

31451911|t|Specific intranasal and central trigeminal electrophysiological responses in Parkinson's disease.
31451911|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent early non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). There is evidence that with regard to trigeminal perception, PD-related olfactory dysfunction is different from other olfactory disorders. More specifically, trigeminal sensitivity, when measured behaviorally, was unimpaired in PD patients as opposed to patients with non-Parkinsonian olfactory dysfunction (NPOD). We sought to investigate the trigeminal pathway by measuring electrophysiological recordings from the nasal epithelium and EEG-derived event-related potentials in response to a specific trigeminal stimulus in 21 PD patients and compare them to 23 patients with NPOD and 25 controls (C). The peripheral trigeminal response, as measured by the negative-mucosa potential, showed no difference between patients with PD and controls whereas PD patients showed faster responses than patients with NPOD, the latter having shown slower and larger responses than controls (18 PD, 14 NPOD, 20 C). The central trigeminal response, as measured by event-related potentials, revealed larger early component response in PD patients compared to patients with NPOD (15 PD, 21 NPOD, 23 C). As expected, psychophysical olfactory testing showed impaired olfactory function in both groups of patients as opposed to controls. Discriminant analysis revealed a model that could predict group membership for 80% of participants based on the negative-mucosa potential latency, olfactory threshold and discrimination tests. These results provide novel insights into the pattern of trigeminal activation in PD which will help to differentiate PD-related olfactory loss from NPOD, a crucial step towards establishing early screening batteries for PD including smell tests.

31515655|t|Hyposmia as a marker of (non-)motor disease severity in Parkinson's disease.
31515655|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of hyposmia in Parkinson's disease (PD) with other motor and non-motor symptoms and with the degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic cell loss. A total of 295 patients with a diagnosis of PD were included. Olfactory function was measured using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Motor symptoms were rated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscale (UPDRS III). To evaluate other non-motor symptoms, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a measure of global cognitive function and validated questionnaires to assess sleep disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, and autonomic dysfunction. A linear regression model was used to calculate correlation coefficients between UPSIT score and motor and non-motor variables [for psychiatric symptoms a Poisson regression was performed]. In a subgroup of patients (n = 155) with a dopamine transporter (DaT) SPECT scan, a similar statistical analysis was performed, now including striatal DaT binding. In the regression models with correction for age, sex, disease duration, and multiple testing, all motor and non-motor symptoms were associated with UPSIT scores. In the subgroup of patients with a DaT-SPECT scan, there was a strong association between olfactory test scores and DaT binding in both putamen and caudate nucleus. Hyposmia in PD is associated with various motor and non-motor symptoms, like cognition, depression, anxiety, autonomic dysfunction and sleep disturbances, and with the degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic cell loss. This finding adds further confirmation that hyposmia holds significant promise as a marker of disease progression.

31734542|t|The prospective role of mesenchymal stem cells exosomes on circumvallate taste buds in induced Alzheimer's disease of ovariectomized albino rats: (Light and transmission electron microscopic study).
31734542|a|OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effect of Alzheimer's disease on the structure of circumvallate papilla taste buds and the possible role of exosomes on the taste buds in Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Forty two ovariectomized female adult albino rats were utilized and divided into: Group I: received vehicle. Group II: received aluminum chloride to induce Alzheimer's disease. Group III: after the induction of Alzheimer's disease, each rat received single dose of exosomes then left for 4 weeks. The circumvallate papillae were prepared for examination by light and transmission electron microscope. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: histomorphometric data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Histological examination of circumvallate papilla in Group I showed normal histological features. Group II revealed distorted features. Group III illustrated nearly normal histological features of circumvallate. Silver impregnation results showed apparently great number of heavily impregnated glossopharyngeal nerve fibers in both Groups I & III but markedly decreased in Group II. Synaptophysin-immunoreactivity was strong in Group I, mild in Group II and moderate in Group III. The ultra-structural examination of taste bud cells revealed normal features in Group I, distorted features in Group II and almost normal features in Group III. Statistically highest mean of Synaptophysin-immunoreactivity area% was for Group I, followed by Group III, and the least value was for Group II. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's disease has degenerative effects. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC)-derived exosomes have the ability to improve the destructive changes induced by Alzheimer's disease.

31946823|t|Wearable Sensors for Prodromal Motor Assessment of Parkinson's Disease using Supervised Learning.
31946823|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by disabling motor and non-motor symptoms. Idiopathic hyposmia (IH), a reduced olfactory sensitivity, is a preclinical marker for the pathology and affects >95% of PD patients. In this paper, SensHand V1 and SensFoot V2, two inertial wearable sensors for upper and lower limbs, were developed to acquire motion data in ten tasks of the MDS-UPDRS III. Fifteen healthy subjects of control, 15 IH people, and 15 PD patients were enrolled. Seventy-one parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis, and the most significant were selected to distinguish among the different classes. Performances of supervised learning algorithms (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) were compared on two-group and three-group classification and considering upper and lower limbs separately or together as a full system. Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (accuracy 1.00 for RF, and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including IH subjects (0.92 F-measure with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, the best performances were obtained using the full system with an RF classifier. The system is, thus, suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Furthermore, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, people at risk for PD can be appropriately analyzed, and subtle changes in motor performance that characterize the prodromal phase and the early PD onset can be identified.

32059086|t|Rhythm disturbances as a potential early marker of Parkinson's disease in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.
32059086|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify timing distortions in production and perception of rhythmic events in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) as early markers of Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Rhythmic skills, clinical characteristics, dysautonomia, depression, and olfaction were compared in 97 participants, including 21 participants with iRBD, 38 patients with PD, and 38 controls, matched for age, gender, and education level. Rhythmic disturbances can be easily detected with dedicated motor tasks via a tablet application. Rhythm production was tested in two conditions: to examine the ability to generate a spontaneous endogenous rhythm, tapping rate and variability in a finger tapping task without external stimulation was measured, while the ability to synchronize to an external rhythm was tested with finger tapping to external auditory cues. Rhythm perception was measured with a task, in which the participants had to detect a deviation from a regular rhythm. Participants with iRBD had dopamine transporter imaging. RESULTS: Participants with iRBD and PD revealed impaired spontaneous rhythm production and poor rhythm perception compared to controls. Impaired rhythm production was correlated with olfaction deficits, dysautonomia, impaired non-motor aspects of daily living, and dopamine uptake measures. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with iRBD show impaired rhythm production and perception; this impairment is correlated with other early markers for PD. Testing rhythmic skills with short and inexpensive tests may be promising for screening for potential future PD in iRBD patients.

32157274|t|Effects of Olfactory Stimulation on Past and Future Thinking in Alzheimer's Disease.
32157274|a|Several studies have demonstrated that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated not only with difficulty in remembering past events but also with a compromised ability to imagine future ones. Recent empirical research has also demonstrated that odor is an effective cue to alleviate difficulty in remembering past events in AD. We investigated whether odor exposure would help AD patients to imagine future events. To this end, we invited AD patients and control participants to evoke past and future events after odor exposure or without odor. Analysis showed that AD patients and control participants produced more specific and more emotional past and future events after odor exposure than without odor. However, odor exposure did not improve the retrieval time for future thinking in AD participants. This study is the first to demonstrate positive effects of odor exposure on the ability of AD patients to project themselves into the future.

32522622|t|Intact olfactory memory in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease from 3 to 15 months of age.
32522622|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that causes profound cognitive dysfunction. Deficits in olfactory memory occur in early stages of AD and may be useful in AD diagnosis. The 5xFAD mouse is a commonly used model of AD, as it develops neuropathology, cognitive and sensori-motor dysfunctions similar to those seen in AD. However, olfactory memory dysfunction has not been studied adequately or in detail in 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, despite sex differences in AD prevalence and symptom presentation, few studies using 5xFAD mice have examined sex differences in learning and memory. Therefore, we tested olfactory memory in male and female 5xFAD mice from 3 to 15 months of age using a conditioned odour preference task. Olfactory memory was not impaired in male or female 5xFAD mice at any age tested, nor were there any sex differences. Because early-onset impairments in very long-term (remote) memory have been reported in 5xFAD mice, we trained a group of mice at 3 months of age and tested olfactory memory 90 days later. Very long-term olfactory memory in 5xFAD mice was not impaired, nor was their ability to perform the discrimination task with new odourants. Examination of brains from 5xFAD mice confirmed extensive Abeta-plaque deposition spanning the olfactory memory system, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, amygdala and piriform cortex. Overall this study indicates that male and female 5xFAD mice do not develop olfactory memory deficits, despite extensive Abeta deposition within the olfactory-memory regions of the brain.

32583050|t|Olfactory testing does not predict beta-amyloid, MRI measures of neurodegeneration or vascular pathology in the British 1946 birth cohort.
32583050|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of olfactory identification deficits as a predictor of cerebral beta-amyloid status and other markers of brain health in cognitively normal adults aged ~ 70 years. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational cohort study. 389 largely healthy and cognitively normal older adults were recruited from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (1946 British Birth cohort) and investigated for olfactory identification deficits, as measured by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Outcome measures were imaging markers of brain health derived from 3 T MRI scanning (cortical thickness, entorhinal cortex thickness, white matter hyperintensity volumes); 18F florbetapir amyloid-PET scanning; and cognitive testing results. Participants were assessed at a single centre between March 2015 and January 2018. RESULTS: Mean (+- SD) age was 70.6 (+- 0.7) years, 50.8% were female. 64.5% had hyposmia and 2.6% anosmia. Olfaction showed no association with beta-amyloid status, hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, AD signature cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity volume, or cognition. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In the early 70s, olfactory function is not a reliable predictor of a range of imaging and cognitive measures of preclinical AD. Olfactory identification deficits are not likely to be a useful means of identifying asymptomatic amyloidosis. Further studies are required to assess if change in olfaction may be a proximity marker for the development of cognitive impairment.

32686370|t|Clinical Perspectives of Parkinson's Disease for Ophthalmologists, Otorhinolaryngologists, Cardiologists, Dentists, Gastroenterologists, Urologists, Physiatrists, and Psychiatrists.
32686370|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystemic disorder characterized by various non-motor symptoms (NMS) in addition to motor dysfunction. NMS include sleep, ocular, olfactory, throat, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or musculoskeletal disorders. A range of NMS, particularly hyposmia, sleep disturbances, constipation, and depression, can even appear prior to the motor symptoms of PD. Because NMS can affect multiple organs and result in major disabilities, the recognition and multidisciplinary and collaborative management of NMS by physicians is essential for patients with PD. Therefore, the aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the organs that are affected by NMS in PD together with a brief review of pathophysiology and treatment options.

32925101|t|Self-Reported Versus Objectively Assessed Olfaction and Parkinson's Disease Risk.
32925101|a|BACKGROUND: Poor olfaction is a prodromal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, self-reported sense of smell is often dismissed as unreliable. OBJECTIVE: To assess self-reported and objectively assessed sense of smell, independently and jointly, in relation to future risk for PD. METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis using data from 2,424 participants, ages 71-82 at baseline, from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. Exposures were self-reported poor sense of smell or taste and the objectively measured 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test score. The outcome was incident PD, analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, race, and cognitive function. RESULTS: After approximately 10 years of follow-up, both self-reported and objectively tested poor sense of smell were independently associated with a higher risk of developing PD: the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 2.8 (1.3, 5.9) and 4.0 (2.1, 7.5), respectively. When analyzed jointly, compared with participants who reported and tested normal, the hazard ratio was 2.2 (1.0, 4.6) for those reported poor sense of smell but tested normal, 3.6 (1.9, 6.9) for reported normal but tested poor, and 7.8 (3.2, 19.4) for both reported and tested poor. We did not find significant interactions between self-reported and objectively tested sense of smell in predicting PD risk. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that self-reported poor sense of smell or taste should not be simply dismissed as useless in predicting risk of PD. Future studies should confirm our finding and evaluate whether structured questionnaires may further improve the predictability.

33646149|t|Sensory Cueing of Autobiographical Memories in Normal Aging and Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparison Between Visual, Auditory, and Olfactory Information.
33646149|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease resulting in a progressive decline of autobiographical memories (AMs) which favors the development of psycho-behavioral disorders. One of the most popular psychosocial interventions in dementia care, Reminiscence Therapy, commonly uses sensory cueing to stimulate AMs retrieval. However, few empirical studies have investigated the impact of sensory stimulation on AMs retrieval in AD. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine the most relevant cue for AMs retrieval in patients with early to mild AD when comparing odors, sounds and pictures. METHODS: Sixty AD patients, 60 healthy older adults (OA), and 60 healthy young adults (YA) participated in our study. Participants were presented with either 4 odors, 4 sounds, or 4 pictures. For each stimulus, they were asked to retrieve a personal memory, to rate it across 3 dimensions (emotionality, vividness, rarity) and then to date it. RESULTS: Overall, results showed no clear dominance of one sensory modality over the others in evoking higher-quality AMs. However, they show that using pictures is the better way to stimulate AD patients' AM, as it helps to retrieve a higher number of memories that are also less frequently retrieved, followed by odors. By contrast, auditory cueing with environmental sounds presented no true advantage. CONCLUSION: Our data should help dementia care professionals to increase the efficiency of Reminiscence Therapy using sensory elicitors. Other clinical implications and future directions are also discussed.

36184786|t|Altered functional connectivity of nucleus accumbens subregions associates with non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
36184786|a|AIMS: This study aimed to identify the functional connectivity (FC) changes of nucleus accumbens (NAc) subregions and characterize the association of network changes and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We enrolled 129 PD patients and 106 healthy controls from our center and the PPMI (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) database. The FC of the bilateral core and shell of the NAc were measured and compared between the two groups. We further used partial least squares correlation to reveal the relationships between altered FC of NAc subregions and manifestations of NMS of PD. RESULTS: The subregions of left core, left shell, and right core had reduced FC with extensive brain regions in PD patients compared with healthy controls. These three subregions were commonly associated with depression, anxiety, apathy, and cognitive impairment. Moreover, the left core and left shell were associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, whereas the right core was associated with olfactory impairment and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. CONCLUSION: This study for the first time identified the neural network changes of NAc subregions in PD and the associations between network changes and phenotypes of NMS. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of NMS in PD.

36207740|t|Mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated Bifidobacterium attenuates brain Abeta burden and improves olfactory dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice by nasal delivery.
36207740|a|BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis or imbalance of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), whereas exogenous SCFAs supplementation exacerbates brain Abeta burden in APP/PS1 mice. Bifidobacterium is the main producer of SCFAs in the gut flora, but oral administration of Bifidobacterium is ineffective due to strong acids and bile salts in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, regulating the levels of SCFAs in the gut is of great significance for AD treatment. METHODS: We investigated the feasibility of intranasal delivery of MSNs-Bifidobacterium (MSNs-Bi) to the gut and their effect on behavior and brain pathology in APP/PS1 mice. RESULTS: Mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) were efficiently immobilized on the surface of Bifidobacterium. After intranasal administration, fluorescence imaging of MSNs-Bi in the abdominal cavity and gastrointestinal tract revealed that intranasally delivered MSNs-Bi could be transported through the brain to the peripheral intestine. Intranasal administration of MSNs-Bi not only inhibited intestinal inflammation and reduced brain Abeta burden but also improved olfactory sensitivity in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that restoring the balance of the gut microbiome contributes to ameliorating cognitive impairment in AD, and that intranasal administration of MSNs-Bi may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention of AD and intestinal disease.

36596700|t|alpha-Synuclein Pathology and Reduced Neurogenesis in the Olfactory System Affect Olfaction in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.
36596700|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by multiple symptoms including olfactory dysfunction, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we explored pathologic changes in the olfactory pathway of transgenic (Tg) mice of both sexes expressing the human A30P mutant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn; alpha-syn-Tg mice) at 6-7 and 12-14 months of age, representing early and late-stages of motor progression, respectively. alpha-Syn-Tg mice at late stages exhibited olfactory behavioral deficits, which correlated with severe alpha-syn pathology in projection neurons (PNs) of the olfactory pathway. In parallel, olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis in alpha-syn-Tg mice was reduced in the OB granule cells at six to seven months and OB periglomerular cells at 12-14 months, respectively, both of which could contribute to olfactory dysfunction. Proteomic analyses showed a disruption in endocytic and exocytic pathways in the OB during the early stages which appeared exacerbated at the synaptic terminals when the mice developed olfactory deficits at 12-14 months. Our data suggest that (1) the alpha-syn-Tg mice recapitulate the olfactory functional deficits seen in PD; (2) olfactory structures exhibit spatiotemporal disparities for vulnerability to alpha-syn pathology; (3) alpha-syn pathology is restricted to projection neurons in the olfactory pathway; (4) neurogenesis in adult alpha-syn-Tg mice is reduced in the OB; and (5) synaptic endocytosis and exocytosis defects in the OB may further explain olfactory deficits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Olfactory dysfunction is a characteristic symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Using the human A30P mutant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn)-expressing mouse model, we demonstrated the appearance of olfactory deficits at late stages of the disease, which was accompanied by the accumulation of alpha-syn pathology in projection neurons (PNs) of the olfactory system. This dysfunction included a reduction in olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis as well as changes in synaptic vesicular transport affecting synaptic function, both of which are likely contributing to olfactory behavioral deficits.

36939310|t|Olfactory dysfunction in patients with Wilson's Disease.
36939310|a|INTRODUCTION: Many neurodegenerative disorders are associated with olfactory dysfunction (OD), but little is known about OD in Wilson's Disease (WD). We evaluated olfactory function in patients with WD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: OD was examined in 68 patients with WD and 70 sex- and age-matched healthy controls using subjective testing with 'Sniffin Sticks'. Threshold discrimination identification (TDI) score and its three components (odour detection threshold, discrimination, and identification) were assessed. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with WD had a significantly weaker sense of smell in terms of TDI (p < 0.01), odour discrimination (p < 0.01), and identification (p < 0.01), but not in terms of odour detection threshold (p = 0.27). Patients with predominantly neurological symptoms were characterised by greater OD by TDI (p < 0.01), odour detection threshold (p = 0.01), and discrimination (p = 0.03). The presence of pathological lesions (p = 0.04) in brain magnetic resonance imaging and generalised brain atrophy (p = 0.02) predisposed to worse TDI. In the WD group, weak inverse correlations between age and TDI score (r = -0.27), odour detection threshold (r = -0.3), and discrimination (r = -0.3) were found. Male gender was a risk factor for abnormal TDI in both WD and controls (both p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WD, particularly older individuals, more frequently had OD than healthy volunteers. Predominantly neurological symptoms, and the presence of typical brain MRI changes, predisposed patients with WD to smell disorders.

38427259|t|Neurobehavioral Analysis to Assess Olfactory and Motor Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.
38427259|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition, primarily affecting dopaminergic neurons. It is defined by motor impairments, such as bradykinesia, stiffness, resting tremor, and postural instability. The striatum, a structure essential for motor control, is impaired in function due to the significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the development of Lewy bodies in the surviving nigral dopaminergic neurons. Olfactory impairment is one of the earliest indications of neurodegenerative disorders like PD that appear years before motor symptoms and cognitive decline development. Olfactory dysfunction is the most common nonmotor PD sign in at least 90% of cases, frequently occurring 5-10 years before motor disturbances. Surprisingly, even though olfactory impairment is intimately linked to PD and is thought to be a potential biomarker, little is known about the brain process underlying this failure. Exposure to environmental toxins has been linked to olfactory dysfunction, leading to nigral neurodegeneration and loss of motor functions. Behavioral neuroscience plays a significant role in identifying and characterizing these olfactory and motor symptoms. In preclinical research, novel treatment approaches are being evaluated in rodent models by behavioral phenotyping to ensure their efficacy. This chapter describes neurobehavioral analysis to assess olfactory and motor dysfunction in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.

38565088|t|Predictors of the rapid progression in prodromal Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal follow-up study.
38565088|a|INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a prodromal phase preceding the onset of classic motor symptoms. The duration and clinical manifestations of prodromal PD vary widely, indicating underlying heterogeneity within this stage. This discrepancy prompts the question of whether specific factors contribute to the divergent rates of progression in prodromal PD. METHODS: This study included prodromal PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. They were followed up to assess the disease progression. The data collected during the follow-up period were analyzed to identify potential predictors of rapid disease progression in prodromal PD. RESULTS: In this study, 61 individuals with prodromal PD were enrolled. Among them, 43 patients presented with both RBD and hyposmia, 17 had hyposmia alone, and 1 had RBD alone at baseline. 13 (21.3%) prodromal PD participants exhibited rapid disease progression, with two of these cases advancing to non-neurological diseases. Significant differences were observed between the rapid progression group and no rapid progression group in terms of MDS-UPDRS II score and UPSIT score. Longitudinal analysis showed a significant increase in the MDS-UPDRS III score and MDS-UPDRS total score in the rapid progression group. Regression analyses identified the MDS-UPDRS II score and UPSIT score as predictors of rapid disease progression in prodromal PD. CONCLUSION: Our study findings suggest that the MDS-UPDRS II score and UPSIT score may serve as clinical markers associated with rapid disease progression. Further research and development of precise biomarkers and advanced assessment methods are needed to enhance our understanding of prodromal PD and its progression patterns.

38702902|t|The effect of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele and olfactory function on odor identification networks.
38702902|a|INTRODUCTION: The combination of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE epsilon4) status, odor identification, and odor familiarity predicts conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: To further understand olfactory disturbances and AD risk, ApoE epsilon4 carrier (mean age 76.38 +- 5.21) and epsilon4 non-carrier (mean age 76.8 +- 3.35) adults were given odor familiarity and identification tests and performed an odor identification task during fMRI scanning. Five task-related functional networks were detected using independent components analysis. Main and interaction effects of mean odor familiarity ratings, odor identification scores, and epsilon4 status on network activation and task-modulation of network functional connectivity (FC) during correct and incorrect odor identification (hits and misses), controlling for age and sex, were explored using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Findings suggested that sensory-olfactory network activation was positively associated with odor identification scores in epsilon4 carriers with intact odor familiarity. The FC of sensory-olfactory, multisensory-semantic integration, and occipitoparietal networks was altered in epsilon4 carriers with poorer odor familiarity and identification. In epsilon4 carriers with poorer familiarity, connectivity between superior frontal areas and the sensory-olfactory network was negatively associated with odor identification scores. CONCLUSIONS: The results contribute to the clarification of the neurocognitive structure of odor identification processing and suggest that poorer odor familiarity and identification in epsilon4 carriers may signal multi-network dysfunction. Odor familiarity and identification assessment in epsilon4 carriers may contribute to the predictive value of risk for MCI and AD due to the breakdown of sensory-cognitive network integration. Additional research on olfactory processing in those at risk for AD is warranted.

38844444|t|Tau propagation in the brain olfactory circuits is associated with smell perception changes in aging.
38844444|a|The direct access of olfactory afferents to memory-related cortical systems has inspired theories about the role of the olfactory pathways in the development of cortical neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used baseline olfactory identification measures with longitudinal flortaucipir and PiB PET, diffusion MRI of 89 cognitively normal older adults (73.82 +- 8.44 years; 56% females), and a transcriptomic data atlas to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading and genetic vulnerabilities of AD-related pathology aggregates in the olfactory system. We find that odor identification deficits are predominantly associated with tau accumulation in key areas of the olfactory pathway, with a particularly strong predictive power for longitudinal tau progression. We observe that tau spreads from the medial temporal lobe structures toward the olfactory system, not the reverse. Moreover, we observed a genetic background of odor perception-related genes that might confer vulnerability to tau accumulation along the olfactory system.

39284050|t|Olfactory deficit and gastrointestinal dysfunction precede motor abnormalities in alpha-Synuclein G51D knock-in mice.
39284050|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically a sporadic late-onset disorder, which has made it difficult to model in mice. Several transgenic mouse models bearing mutations in SNCA, which encodes alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), have been made, but these lines do not express SNCA in a physiologically accurate spatiotemporal pattern, which limits the ability of the mice to recapitulate the features of human PD. Here, we generated knock-in mice bearing the G51D SNCA mutation. After establishing that their motor symptoms begin at 9 mo of age, we then sought earlier pathologies. We assessed the phosphorylation at Serine 129 of alpha-Syn in different tissues and detected phospho-alpha-Syn in the olfactory bulb and enteric nervous system at 3 mo of age. Olfactory deficit and impaired gut transit followed at 6 mo, preceding motor symptoms. The SncaG51D mice thus parallel the progression of human PD and will enable us to study PD pathogenesis and test future therapies.

2919866|t|The olfactory and cognitive deficits of Parkinson's disease: evidence for independence.
2919866|a|In the present study we sought to determine whether the olfactory deficits of parkinsonism are related to the cognitive and perceptual-motor manifestations of the disease. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed among a number of olfactory, neurological, and neuropsychological measures obtained from 58 Parkinson's disease patients, including the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, a modified Randt memory test, a reaction time test, a finger-tapping test, ratings of motor and neurological function, and selected verbal and performance subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised. Data from 38 patients with Parkinson's disease who received odor detection threshold testing were also evaluated. The intercorrelation matrix was subjected to a principal components factor analysis which yielded six clear-cut factors: cognitive/memory, gross motor, oral motor, fine motor, olfactory, and tremor. The olfactory factor received strong and nearly exclusive loadings from the olfactory measures (which did not evidence meaningful loadings on any of the other factors). A ten-trial jackknife procedure revealed the factor structure to be stable. Further support of the independence of the olfactory variables from the other measures was provided by multiple regression and canonical correlation analyses. Overall, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that the olfactory disorder of parkinsonism is independent of the cognitive, perceptual-motor, and memory manifestations of the disease.

8309571|t|Olfactory function in Parkinson's disease subtypes.
8309571|a|Decreased olfactory function commonly occurs in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), regardless of stage, treatment, or duration of disease. In the present study, we sought to determine whether different subtypes of PD, categorized according to well-defined clinical criteria, evidence different degrees of olfactory dysfunction. Significantly different scores on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) were present between patients with benign PD and malignant PD (respective means [SD] = 22.51 [8.50] and 17.38 [6.29]) and between tremor-predominant PD and postural instability-gait disorder (PIGD)-predominant PD (23.43 [8.18] versus 17.35 [6.00]). No statistically significant differences in UPSIT scores were observed between young-onset and older-onset PD patients. Women outperformed men in most subtypes examined.

8838785|t|Evaluation of olfactory function by topographic EEG analysis in patients with Parkinson's disease.
8838785|a|Olfactory function impairment has been observed in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) using psychophysical procedures. In this study, an electrophysiological technique based on spectral analysis and topographic EEG mapping was used to evaluate EEG arousal response to olfactory stimulation in ten normal subjects and ten PD patients in stage II according to Hoehn and Yahr's scale, all of whom had akinetic-rigid syndrome and were receiving chronic L-Dopa therapy. Olfactory function was stimulated using diluted benzaldehyde by means of an apparatus set up in our laboratory. Spontaneous and post-olfactory stimulus EEGs were recorded from 20 electrodes placed upon the scalp according to the Int. 10-20 System. Total EEG power (from 0.5 to 19.5 Hz) was evaluated over 10 sec. artefact-free epochs. An olfactory arousal reaction was detected in nine of the ten PD patients and was characterised by a significant decrease in total power similar to that observed in all of the 10 normal subjects; these variations in EEG were found in all but the anterior regions of the scalp. The use of this technique does not seem to reveal any clear alteration in the olfactory function of PD patients.

9375222|t|Sensory- and memory-mediated olfactory dysfunction in Huntington's disease.
9375222|a|Neuropathology in Huntington's disease (HD) known to project to areas that process olfactory information raises the questions of which olfactory function, if any, is most affected in HD, and how to explain such dysfunction in terms of olfactory sensitivity and cognition. These questions were studied by comparing HD patients and controls (matched for age, gender, and education) on absolute detection, intensity discrimination, quality discrimination, short-term recognition memory, and lexical- and picture-based identification for odor. Taste or vision were used as comparison modalities. The results suggest that whereas odor-recognition memory is not affected in patients with HD, these patients have impaired olfactory functioning with respect to absolute detection, intensity discrimination, quality discrimination, and identification. The three latter impairments were significantly explained by poor detection sensitivity. Odor identification was the function most affected.

11456307|t|Subclinical dopaminergic dysfunction in asymptomatic Parkinson's disease patients' relatives with a decreased sense of smell.
11456307|a|By the time a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is made, a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons has already occurred. Identifying patients in the period between the presumed onset of dopaminergic cell loss and the appearance of clinical parkinsonism may be of major importance in the development of effective neuroprotective treatment strategies. In an effort to develop a feasible strategy to detect preclinical PD, a combination of olfactory processing tasks, including odor detection, odor identification, and odor discrimination was used to select groups of hyposmic and normosmic individuals from a total of 250 relatives (parents, siblings, or children) of subjects with PD. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]beta-CIT as a dopamine transporter ligand was used to assess nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in 25 hyposmic and 23 normosmic relatives of PD patients. An abnormal reduction in striatal dopamine transporter binding was found in 4 out of 25 hyposmic relatives of PD patients, two of whom subsequently developed clinical parkinsonism, and in none of the 23 normosmic relatives. These observations demonstrate that subclinical reductions in dopamine transporter binding can be detected in asymptomatic relatives of sporadic PD patients by means of [123I]beta-CIT and SPECT. The results further indicate that olfactory deficits may precede clinical motor signs in PD.

12522572|t|Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
12522572|a|In idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) approximately 60 % of the nigrostriatal neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) are degenerated before neurologists can establish the diagnosis according to the widely accepted clinical diagnostic criteria. It is conceivable that neuroprotective therapy starting at such an 'advanced stage' of the disease will fail to stop the degenerative process. Therefore, the identification of patients at risk and at earlier stages of the disease appears to be essential for any successful neuroprotection. The discovery of several genetic mutations associated with IPD raises the possibility that these, or other biomarkers, of the disease may help to identify persons at risk of IPD. Transcranial ultrasound have shown susceptibility factors for IPD related to an increased iron load of the substantia nigra. In the early clinical phase, a number of motor and particularly non-motor signs emerge, which can be identified by the patients and physicians years before the diagnosis is made, notably olfactory dysfunction, depression, or 'soft' motor signs such as changes in handwriting, speech or reduced ambulatory arm motion. These signs of the early, prediagnostic phase of IPD can be detected by inexpensive and easy-to-administer tests. As one single instrument will not be sensitive enough, a battery of tests has to be composed measuring independent parameters of the incipient disease. Subjects with abnormal findings in this test battery should than be submitted to nuclear medicine examinations to quantify the extent of dopaminergic injury and to reach the goal of a reliable, early diagnosis.

12885574|t|3-Nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in olfactory receptor neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease: implications for impaired odor sensitivity.
12885574|a|Olfactory sensory function is impaired in patients with the diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to elderly controls, and the olfactory epithelium (OE) of AD patients exhibits several pathological changes characteristic of the AD brain. To confirm that the populations from whom our postmortem tissues are obtained exhibit similar decrements in sensory function, threshold testing was performed; probable AD patients had significantly higher olfactory thresholds than controls. To determine if oxidative stress contributes to decreased olfactory function in AD, we localized 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) immunoreactivity in OE obtained postmortem from patients with neuropathologically confirmed AD and age-matched controls with brains free of significant neurodegenerative pathology. In AD patients, immunoreactivity was localized in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), including dendritic knobs where ion channels that participate in sensory transduction are located, suggesting a direct mechanism for olfactory impairment. In controls, immunoreactivity occurred in blood vessel endothelium, suggesting age-related vascular dysfunction. Immunohistochemistry for CD68, a macrophage scavenger receptor, demonstrated activated macrophages, a source of free radicals contributing to 3-NT formation, in the OE of AD patients but not controls. These results demonstrate increased oxidative stress and modification of ORN proteins that may contribute directly to olfactory impairment in AD patients.

15370375|t|The effect of the ApoE epsilon4 allele on recognition memory for olfactory and visual stimuli in patients with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease, probable Alzheimer's disease, and healthy elderly controls.
15370375|a|Episodic recognition memory for odors, faces, and unfamiliar symbols was assessed in apolipoprotein episilon4 positive and epsilon4 negative individuals with pathologically-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD), individuals diagnosed with probable AD, and healthy age- and gender-matched controls. The analyses revealed significant differences in performance between the AD patients and nondemented elderly controls based on the presence of the epsilon4 allele and the modality of the stimulus to be remembered. Measures of hits did not discriminate among groups but an analysis of false positive errors revealed significant differences, particularly for olfactory stimuli. Nondemented epsilon4 positive controls committed fewer false positive errors for olfactory stimuli compared to all other groups. In contrast, nondemented epsilon4 positive controls committed false positive errors for olfactory stimuli at rates similar to the AD patients. The performance of epsilon4 positive and epsilon4 negative controls was indistinguishable on the visual recognition memory tasks suggesting the particular vulnerability of olfactory memory to the early neuropathology of AD resulting in false positive errors in recognition memory for olfactory stimuli. The results of the present study offer new insight into how recognition memory is affected by AD, the epsilon4 allele, and the modality of the stimulus to be remembered.

There was a significant positive correlation between cardiac MIBG uptake and the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification (CCSI) score in patients with PD (r = 0.56; P = 0.003) independent of the disease duration or clinical rating of motor status. However, patients with MSA did not show a significant correlation between cardiac MIBG uptake and the CCSI score. Our findings suggest that the functional losses of the olfactory and cardiac sympathetic systems are closely coupled in PD.

17126861|t|Disgust and Huntington's disease.
17126861|a|The disproportionate impairment for the recognition of facial expressions of disgust in patients with Huntington's disease (HD) forms a double dissociation with the impaired recognition of fear that has been reported in amygdala patients. The dissociation has generated discussion regarding the potential existence of neural substrates dedicated to the recognition of facial signals of specific emotions. The aim of this study was to establish whether the impairment for disgust in HD was restricted solely to the domain of facial perception, or whether HD patients also demonstrate impairment in other kinds of disgust. Fourteen HD patients and fourteen age and education matched healthy controls participated in seven disparate emotion processing tasks. (1) A measure of knowledge for the situational determinants of distinct emotions; (2) recognition of emotion expressed in nonverbal vocalisations; (3) recognition of the emotional content of explicit lexical stimuli; (4) recognition of emotional content in pictures of emotion scenes; (5) a disgust experience questionnaire; (6) a measure of olfactory hedonic responsiveness; (7) a measure of gustatory perception. While verbal aspects of disgust processing were preserved, parallel impairments were revealed for olfactory disgust, vocal disgust expressions, the classification of disgusting pictures, and declarative knowledge of disgust elicitors. The finding of impaired perception of disgust signalled through different input domains suggests that the inability to recognise the facial expression in this population reflects a fundamental problem with disgust processing.

17349813|t|Non-motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
17349813|a|In the field of neurology, Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly perceived to be a disorder affecting only the (extrapyramidal) motor system, characteristically manifesting as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. Although non-motor symptoms such as behavioural abnormalities, dysautonomia, sleep disturbances and sensory dysfunctions are also common and quite disabling manifestations of the disease, they are often not formally assessed and thus are frequently misdiagnosed and/or under diagnosed. For this reason, in this review we have concentrated on the pathophysiological and clinical basis of non-motor involvement such as olfactory dysfunction, depression, dementia, dysautonomia and sleep disorders in PD. The early recognition of these symptoms may well perhaps lead to an earlier diagnosis of PD, but in any case should lead to more prompt and effective treatment of the relatively unrecognized non-motor problems associated with PD.

17594326|t|Classical Parkinson disease versus Parkinson complex--reflections against staging and in favour of heterogeneity.
17594326|a|Pathological studies have prompted the idea that Parkinson disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder, which starts far away from the nigrostriatal dopamine system and it goes through a long pre-clinical period. Evidence from epidemiological research, functional imaging, olfaction and sleep studies provides support to this hypothesis. Accordingly, PD is seen as an homogeneous disease which sequentially affects different neural structures leading to a well-defined clinical picture. This concept, recently named PD complex, has deep theoretical and practical implications which raise some concerns. This report shows the concept of classical PD as opposed to PD complex. Although the relevance of the central argument concerning the PD complex concept is admitted, it needs to be fully proved before premature conclusions are drawn. In contrast, the notion of classical and clinically significant PD can explain many of the well-characterized pathological and clinical features of the disease and it gives support to the idea that the magic word in PD is variability.

17954785|t|Beating a dead horse: dopamine and Parkinson disease.
17954785|a|Our collective thinking about Parkinson disease (PD) has been heavily influenced by the dramatic response to dopamine replacement therapy. For progress to continue, however, we need to take a broad view of this disorder, which includes recognition of the following. First, substantial evidence now indicates that dopamine oxidation is unlikely to substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Second, levodopa therapy is not associated with neurotoxicity. Third, the first neurons affected in PD are nondopaminergic; the substantia nigra and other dopaminergic nuclei are affected only later in the course. Thus, PD is much more than degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system. Fourth, in the current era, most of the disability of advancing PD is from involvement of nondopaminergic systems, including levodopa-refractory motor symptoms, dementia, and dysautonomia. Motor complications associated with levodopa therapy can be problematic, but they can be controlled in most, using available medications and deep brain stimulation surgery. We have reached the point of diminishing therapeutic returns with drugs acting on dopamine systems; more dopaminergic medications will provide only modest incremental benefit over current therapies. Finally, the benefits from transplantation surgeries aimed at restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission will be limited because later-stage PD disability comes from nondopaminergic substrates. Scale.

17961138|t|Parkinson's disease: a dual-hit hypothesis.
17961138|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that sporadic Parkinson's disease has a long prodromal period during which several non-motor features develop, in particular, impairment of olfaction, vagal dysfunction and sleep disorder. Early sites of Lewy pathology are the olfactory bulb and enteric plexus of the stomach. We propose that a neurotropic pathogen, probably viral, enters the brain via two routes: (i) nasal, with anterograde progression into the temporal lobe; and (ii) gastric, secondary to swallowing of nasal secretions in saliva. These secretions might contain a neurotropic pathogen that, after penetration of the epithelial lining, could enter axons of the Meissner's plexus and, via transsynaptic transmission, reach the preganglionic parasympathetic motor neurones of the vagus nerve. This would allow retrograde transport into the medulla and, from here, into the pons and midbrain until the substantia nigra is reached and typical aspects of disease commence. Evidence for this theory from the perspective of olfactory and autonomic dysfunction is reviewed, and the possible routes of pathogenic invasion are considered. It is concluded that the most parsimonious explanation for the initial events of sporadic Parkinson's disease is pathogenic access to the brain through the stomach and nose - hence the term 'dual-hit'.

18250955|t|[(123)I]-FP-CIT SPECT and olfaction test in patients with combined postural and rest tremor.
18250955|a|Mixed-type tremors pose a clinical diagnostic challenge. The aim of the study was to better characterize patients with combined postural and rest tremor. Patients were categorized into four groups: essential tremor (ET) (n = 7), combined rest + postural tremor (n = 17), PD (n = 17), and control subjects (n = 9). All underwent the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The mixed-tremor group was also evaluated with SPECT imaging using the dopamine transporter (DaT) ligand (123)I-labeled FP-CIT. There was no significant difference in olfaction scores between the mixed tremor and essential tremor groups (23.2 +/- 6.6 vs 21.7 +/- 4.9) or between these groups and controls (27.2 +/- 5.0). The patients with PD had significantly lower scores than all the other groups (13.7 +/- 5.4, p < 0.001). Of the 12 patients with mixed tremor evaluated by SPECT, 9 had normal findings. This study suggests that rest tremor is part of the spectrum of ET, even in patients with long-standing disease. However, in a minority of patients, there might be transformation of ET-PD.

18477840|t|Effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on olfactory function in Parkinson's disease patients.
18477840|a|OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on olfaction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: 15 patients suffering from sporadic PD-related dysosmia were implanted with bilateral electrodes aimed at the STN. One week before the surgery, odor detection threshold (DT) and identification threshold (IT) were evaluated in all patients using the 'five odor olfactory detection arrays' in both medication-off and medication-on conditions. 15 healthy age-matched controls also received the same olfactory evaluation. Patient evaluations were repeated at 6 and 12 months postoperatively in a medication-off/stimulator-on or medication-off/stimulator-off condition. Odor DT and IT scores were compared pre- and postoperatively, as well as between the medication-off/stimulator-on or -off conditions. RESULTS: The motor symptoms of all 15 PD patients, including rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability, and gait were significantly improved after stimulator implantation. The UPDRS motor (UPDRS III) scores decreased significantly in the medication-off/stimulator-on condition (p < 0.01). The odor DT and IT scores of PD patients were higher than those of healthy controls (p < 0.01). In the medication-off/stimulator-off condition, there was no significant difference in the odor DT and IT scores in PD patients pre- vs. postoperatively (p > 0.05). Notably, there were no significant alterations to DT scores in the stimulator-on and -off conditions at the 6- and 12-month follow-up (p > 0.05), whereas IT scores were significantly improved in the stimulation-on relative to the stimulation-off condition at the 6- and 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: STN DBS can significantly improve olfactory cognitive function in PD patients. The possible mechanisms include an improvement in striatal metabolism and neuronal activity in the orbitofrontal cortex mediated by STN DBS, as well as increased glucose metabolism in the striatum, midbrain, cingulate gyrus, and motor and higher-order somatosensory association cortices.

18513119|t|Altered ingestive behavior, weight changes, and intact olfactory sense in an APP overexpression model.
18513119|a|Transgenic APP23 mice were generated to model Alzheimer's disease. The APP23 model develops pathological features, learning deficits, and memory deficits analogous to dementing patients. In this report, transgenic mice exhibited several behavioral disturbances indicating the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Aiming to verify whether the model also develops other behavioral problems, the authors investigated ingestive behavior in APP23 males of 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition, body weights of a naive male group were longitudinally monitored starting at weaning. Olfactory acuity was evaluated in mice of different age groups. Although olfactory functioning of APP23 mice appeared intact, they drank more and took more food pellets compared with wild-type littermates during a 1-week registration period. From the age of 4.5 weeks onward, APP23 males weighed significantly less than their control littermates, whereas this difference became more prominent with increasing age. Our results suggest the presence of a hypermetabolic state in this model. This is the first report, evidencing the presence of changes in eating and drinking behavior in a single transgenic Alzheimer mouse model.

18555528|t|Olfaction: a potential cognitive marker of psychiatric disorders.
18555528|a|Cognitive deficits are well documented in psychiatric disorders, particularly in schizophrenia and depression. Cognitive activity roots in perceptions. However, research on sensorial alterations in psychiatric conditions has mainly focused on visual or auditory processes and less on olfaction. Here, we examine data on olfactory deficits in psychiatric patients using a systematic review of recent publications. Schizophrenic patients are mainly characterized by no reliable change in odour sensitivity and by a deficit in odour identification, recognition and discrimination. Depressed patients principally exhibit a deficit in the hedonic aspects of this perception, even if, in some case, alterations in sensitivity or identification are also found. Changes in odour perception are also found in dementia and in some neurodegenerative disease, but in this case alterations concern all aspects of the sensorial experience (detection threshold, identification and recognition). Taken together, these data indicate that olfactory abnormalities might be a marker of psychiatric conditions, with a specific pattern for each disease.

18709686|t|Manifestations of Parkinson disease differ in association with REM sleep behavior disorder.
18709686|a|REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is commonly associated with Parkinson disease (PD), but it is unclear whether this association has implications for disease manifestations. We evaluated 36 PD patients for the presence of RBD by polysomnography. Patients underwent an extensive evaluation by a movement disorders specialist blinded to polysomnography results. Severity of motor manifestations, autonomic, visual, psychiatric, and olfactory dysfunctions and quality of life (QOL) were assessed, and compared using regression analysis that adjusted for disease duration, age and sex. Severity of motor manifestations did not differ between groups. However, the presence of RBD in PD was strongly associated with symptoms and signs of orthostatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure lying to standing = -25.7 +/- 13.0 mmHg vs. -4.9 +/-14.1, P < 0.001); and orthostatic symptom prevalence = 71% vs. 27%, P = 0.0076). There was no association between RBD and other autonomic symptoms. Color vision was worse in patients with RBD, but olfactory dysfunction did not differ between groups. The prevalence of depression, hallucinations, paranoia, and impulse disorders did not differ between groups. Emotional functioning and general health QOL measures were lower in those with RBD, but there were no differences between groups on disease-specific indices or on measures of overall physical QOL. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of RBD and nonmotor manifestations of PD, particularly autonomic dysfunction, are linked.

18785265|t|The use of smell identification tests in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in Brazil.
18785265|a|Smell identification tests may be of routine clinical value in the differential diagnosis of PD but are subject to cultural variation and have not been systematically evaluated in the Brazilian population. We have applied culturally adapted translations of the University of Pennsylvania 40-item smell identification test (UPSIT-40) and the 16-item identification test from Sniffin' Sticks (SS-16) to nondemented Brazilian PD patients and controls. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the test scores was 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.81, n = 204, P < 0.001). To calculate reliability measures for each test we used the diagnosis (either PD or control) as outcome variable for separate logistic regression analyses using the score in the UPSIT-40 or the SS-16 as a covariate. The SS-16 specificity was 89.0% with a sensitivity of 81.1% (106 PD and 118 controls). The UPSIT-40 specificity was 83.5% and its sensitivity 82.1% (95 PD and 109 controls). Regression curves were used to associate an individual's smell test score with the probability of belonging to the PD, as opposed to the control group. Our data provide support for the use of the UPSIT-40 and SS-16 to help distinguish early PD from controls.

19221308|t|Diagnosis and the premotor phase of Parkinson disease.
19221308|a|Clinical, neuroimaging, and pathologic studies have provided data suggesting that a variety of nonmotor symptoms can precede the classic motor features of Parkinson disease (PD) by years and, perhaps, even decades. The period when these symptoms arise can be referred to as the "premotor phase" of the disease. Here, we review the evidence supporting the occurrence of olfactory dysfunction, dysautonomia, and mood and sleep disorders, in this premotor phase of PD. These symptoms are well known in established PD and when presenting early, in the premotor phase, should be potentially considered as an integral part of the disease process. Even though information on the premotor phase of PD is rapidly accumulating, the diagnosis of premotor PD remains elusive at this time. Should a safe and effective treatment with disease-modifying or neuroprotective potential in PD become available, identifying individuals in the premotor phase will become a serious priority.

19353591|t|Hyposmia and executive dysfunction as predictors of future Parkinson's disease: a prospective study.
19353591|a|Olfactory deficits and executive dysfunction are early and common symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have shown that hyposmia can be a first sign of PD. The aim of the present study was to determine which of three olfactory tests and two selected tests of executive function would be the best predictor of future PD over a 5 year period. In a cohort of 361 nonparkinsonian, nondemented first-degree relatives of PD patients, in whom alternative causes of olfactory dysfunction were excluded, we measured baseline performance on three olfactory and two executive function tasks. Five years from baseline, clinical neurological evaluation and/or a screening questionnaire, sensitive to the presence of Parkinsonism, were used to detect individuals developing clinical PD. Our results show that in first degree relatives of PD patients worse performance on each of three olfactory processing tasks was associated with an increased risk of developing PD within 5 years, whereas performance on selected tests of executive dysfunction was not associated with an increased risk of developing PD. Interestingly, impaired odor discrimination was the best predictor for future PD.

19412948|t|Adapting the Sniffin' Sticks to diagnose Parkinson's disease in Sri Lanka.
19412948|a|Tests of odor identification might help differentiate Parkinson's disease (PD) from other causes of tremor, but they are culture and language specific and are not currently available for the population of Sri Lanka. We created a Sinhala adaptation of the 16-item identification test from Sniffin' Sticks (SS-16) and applied it to 89 nondemented Sri Lankan PD patients and 100 controls. Twelve of the SS-16 items were correctly identified by at least 50% of the control subjects and were included in a battery, which we called as Colombo SS-12. We used the diagnosis (PD or control) as outcome variable for a logistic regression using age, gender, smoking status and the SS-12 as covariates, and found only the last two were significant covariates. The Colombo SS-12 specificity was 93.0% with a sensitivity of 91.0%, indicating it could be a helpful tool in the diagnosis of PD in Sri Lanka.

19692193|t|Voxel-based analysis of diffusion tensor indices in the brain in patients with Parkinson's disease.
19692193|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the abnormal diffusion in cerebral white matter and its relationship with the olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging of the cerebrum was performed in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease and 25 control subjects matched for age and sex. Differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between these two groups were studied by voxel-based analysis of the DTI data. Correlations between diffusion indices and the olfactory function in PD patients were evaluated using the multiple regression model after controlling for the duration of the disease, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Sale (UPDRS), and age. RESULTS: The damaged white and gray matter showed decreased FA or increased MD, localized bilaterally in the cerebellar and orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, in PD patients there was a positive correlation between FA values in the white matter of the left cerebellum and the thresholds of olfactory identification (TOI) and a negative correlation between MD values in the white matter of right cerebellum and the TOI. CONCLUSION: In patients with PD, there was disruption in the cerebellar white matter which may play an important role in the olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease.

19843648|t|Markers of neurodegeneration in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease.
19843648|a|Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is an important risk factor in the development of Parkinson's disease. Numerous potential predictive markers of Parkinson's disease may present before motor symptoms emerge, but testing of these markers in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has been performed only in small studies. There has been no comparison of markers between patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease, and between men and women. We evaluated an array of potential Parkinson's disease predictive markers in 159 patients; including 68 with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 36 controls, 34 Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 21 Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Compared with controls, patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrated substantial olfactory loss (P < 0.001). Olfaction was more impaired in Parkinson's disease than idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and did not differ between Parkinson's patients with, or without, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Numerous measures of motor function including the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale alternate tap, Purdue Peg Board and Timed 'Up and Go' were impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.01). All of these motor measures were worse with Parkinson's disease than with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, regardless of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status. Autonomic symptoms and systolic blood pressure drop were impaired in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P = 0.003). Orthostatic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease were found in the group with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). However, Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder were not different than controls and had less impairment than those with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P = 0.004) and Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). Colour vision was impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.001). However, only Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder had abnormalities significantly different than controls (P < 0.001), and there were significant differences between Parkinson's patients with or without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.04). Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder patients had slightly increased harm avoidance scores on personality testing (P = 0.04). Other than slightly better performances among women in the Purdue Peg Board, there was no difference in any measure between men and women, suggesting similar pathogenic processes underlying rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrate abnormalities in numerous potential markers of neurodegenerative disease--these markers are heterogeneous, generally correlate with each other and occur equally in men and women. Although these abnormalities are usually intermediate between control values and Parkinson's patients, autonomic dysfunction and colour vision appear to be more linked to rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status than Parkinson's disease, suggesting a unique pathophysiology of these abnormalities.

19965851|t|Olfactory testing combined with dopamine transporter imaging as a method to detect prodromal Parkinson's disease.
19965851|a|Objective Olfactory dysfunction is an early and common symptom in Parkinson disease (PD). Previously, the authors demonstrated that idiopathic olfactory dysfunction in first-degree relatives of PD patients is associated with an increased risk of developing PD within 2 years. The aim of the present study was to determine the value of combined olfactory testing and SPECT scanning in predicting future PD in the same population of relatives over a 5-year period. Methods In a cohort of 361 non-parkinsonian, non-demented first-degree relatives of PD patients, a combination of olfactory processing tasks was used to select groups of hyposmic (n=40) and normosmic (n=38) individuals for a 5-year clinical follow-up evaluation and sequential SPECT scanning, using a dopamine transporter ligand to assess nigrostriatal dopaminergic function at baseline and 5 years from baseline. A validated questionnaire, sensitive to the presence of parkinsonism, was used in the follow-up of the remaining 283 relatives. Results Five years from baseline, five out of the 40 hyposmic relatives fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for PD. None of the other 349 relatives available for follow-up developed PD. All hyposmic individuals developing PD had an abnormal baseline SPECT scan. Discussion In conclusion, idiopathic hyposmia in first-degree relatives of PD patients is associated with an increased risk of developing clinical PD of 12.5% over a 5-year period. The present data suggest that a two-step approach using olfactory testing followed by SPECT scanning in hyposmic individuals has a very high sensitivity and specificity in detecting PD. The usefulness of this two-step approach needs to be confirmed in larger populations.

20030239|t|[Pathophysiological process underlying Parkinson's disease: motor & non-motor symptoms].
20030239|a|It is proposed that alpha-synucleinopathy initially affects the medulla oblongata and then progresses to more rostral brain areas ("Braak hypothesis"). According to this hypothesis, substantia nigra is affected in the later stages of PD. Another region affected in the earlier stages was reported to be olfactory bulb, although the following processes were not described in detail. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that non-motor symptoms including constipation, depression, REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and hyposmia may be prodromal symptoms in PD. The pathological staging postulated by the Braak hypothesis is in good agreement with the fact that these non-motor symptoms precede motor symptoms in PD, because affected brain areas in the early stages, such as dorsal vagal nucleus, locus ceruleus and olfactory bulb, are related to these non-motor features. Recently, it was reported that although half of brains corresponded to the Braak hypothesis, there were a high proportion of cases which did not fit the Braak's staging system and majority of the latter demonstrated amygdale-predominant alpha-synucleinopathy. It was also demonstrated that the Lewy pathology in olfactory bulb was closely related to the presence of alpha-synuclein pathology in amygdala. The amygdala is one of the main systems in odor perception and in PD, cortical neurons in corticomedial complex of amygdale, which have major olfactory connections, are selectively affected even in the early stages of the disease. We recently obtained the data suggesting that metabolic changes in the amygdala were associated with low scores in odor identification test. These data suggest that not only the olfactory bulb, but also the amygdala is also responsible for hyposmia in PD and that there may be another pathological process, which starts from the olfactory bulb and involves the amygdala.

20083001|t|Diagnosing premotor Parkinson's disease using a two-step approach combining olfactory testing and DAT SPECT imaging.
20083001|a|Extranigral neuropathological changes may precede the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones in Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, non-motor disturbances are an interesting target for the development of tests aimed at identifying individuals with premotor PD. An impaired sense of smell occurs with high prevalence in the clinical motor stages of PD patients and has also been reported in first-degree relatives of PD patients. In a prospective study in 361 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of PD patients, we studied the value of a two-step approach, combining olfactory testing and dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging, in detecting patients in the premotor phase of PD. Unexplained hyposmia alone was associated with a 12.5% risk of developing PD within a five year period. Cox regression analysis revealed that odour discrimination performance was most strongly correlated with the risk of future PD. Furthermore, all relatives that later developed PD had both hyposmia and abnormally reduced striatal DAT binding at baseline. The results of our studies provide the proof-of-principle that a two-step approach of olfactory testing and DAT SPECT imaging may serve to diagnose PD in its premotor phase. Yet, the low positive predictive value of hyposmia indicates that a wider application of this approach for screening purposes would require too many DAT SPECT scans in healthy individuals. Therefore, future studies in larger populations are necessary to further characterize premotor PD and identify additional genetic and/or clinical susceptibility markers to be used in conjunction with olfactory testing as additional screening steps toward diagnosing PD in its earliest stages.

20119648|t|Olfactory dysfunction and cardiovascular dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease.
20119648|a|Several studies have reported that olfactory dysfunction is an early neuropathological manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reduced cardiac meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) uptake may be one of the earliest signs of PD. We studied the relation of olfactory dysfunction to cardiovascular dysautonomia in patients with PD. The study group comprised 66 patients with PD (70.5 years) and 26 controls (70.3 years) for olfactory assessment, 21 controls (72.1 years) for cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy and heart rate variability (HRV), assessed using the coefficient of variation for RR intervals (HRV), and 23 controls (69.2 years) for orthostatic blood pressure response. Olfactory function was assessed by the odor stick identification test Japan (OSIT-J), and cardiovascular autonomic function was evaluated by (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy of the heart, the fall in orthostatic blood pressure, and HRV. Patients with PD had a significantly lower OSIT-J score than did the controls (4.1 +/- 3.0 vs. 9.9 +/- 1.7, p = 0.001). The OSIT-J score was unrelated to variables other than gender, including age, disease duration, motor score on the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, score on the mini-mental state examination, motor phenotype, visual hallucinations, and dopaminergic medication on multiple regression and logistic regression analyses. The OSIT-J score was related to the heart/mediastinum ratio of cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake, the fall in orthostatic blood pressure, and HRV, after adjustment for other clinical variables. Olfactory dysfunction in PD was, thus, significantly related to both cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, as well as vascular sympathetic dysfunction. As non-motor symptoms of PD, olfactory dysfunction and autonomic network failure appear to be closely related in PD.

20182024|t|Effects of caffeine in Parkinson's disease: from neuroprotection to the management of motor and non-motor symptoms.
20182024|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 60 years. Classically, PD is considered to be a motor system disease and its diagnosis is based on the presence of a set of cardinal motor signs (rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor) that are consequence of a pronounced death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Nowadays there is considerable evidence showing that non-dopaminergic degeneration also occurs in other brain areas which seems to be responsible for the deficits in olfactory, emotional and memory functions that precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. The present review attempts to examine results reported in epidemiological, clinical and animal studies to provide a comprehensive picture of the antiparkinsonian potential of caffeine. Convergent epidemiological and pre-clinical data suggest that caffeine may confer neuroprotection against the underlying dopaminergic neuron degeneration, and influence the onset and progression of PD. The available data also suggest that caffeine can improve the motor deficits of PD and that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists such as istradefylline reduces OFF time and dyskinesia associated with standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments. Finally, recent experimental findings have indicated the potential of caffeine in the management of non-motor symptoms of PD, which do not improve with the current dopaminergic drugs. Altogether, the studies reviewed provide strong evidence that caffeine may represent a promising therapeutic tool in PD, thus being the first compound to restore both motor and non-motor early symptoms of PD together with its neuroprotective potential.

20187234|t|The nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease--an overview.
20187234|a|Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are very common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may result in significant disability. The increased focus on these important clinical features represents a major advance in the care of PD patients. In this article, we provide an overview of recent developments in the field.

20198714|t|Discriminative power of different nonmotor signs in early Parkinson's disease. A case-control study.
20198714|a|The objective of this study was to evaluate the discriminative power of different nonmotor signs for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty patients with PD with <or=3 years of disease duration were compared with 30 healthy controls. Six deficit domains (DD) were defined: hyposmia, sleep abnormalities, dysautonomia, visual deficits, executive dysfunction, and depression. Plotting of Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and exact conditional logistic modeling, followed by manual stepwise descending procedure were used to identify a model for nonmotor signs that detects early PD. Patients with PD and controls did not differ in terms of age, gender, and educational level. Several DD discriminated patients with PD from healthy controls. Visual deficits showed the largest area under the ROC curve (0.83), followed by hyposmia (0.81) and dysautonomia (0.80). When combining the DD visual deficits and dysautonomia, the best residual model was obtained; it maximized both sensitivity and specificity for PD at a level of 0.77. At an early disease stage, several nonmotor domains were already able to discriminate patients with PD from healthy controls. Visual deficits had the best discriminatory power. Being brief and inexpensive, visual tests should be further investigated in larger cohorts as potential screening tool for early PD.

20586740|t|Are dysautonomic and sensory symptoms present in early Parkinson's disease?
20586740|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs with an annual incidence of 13/100.000, is slightly more frequent in men and is characterized by the motor symptoms tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. In addition, non-motor symptoms have been increasingly connected to the disease although already described in James Parkinson's 'Essay on the shaking palsy' from 1817. The motor symptoms in PD are related to the degeneration of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra (SN). These symptoms respond well to dopaminergic substitution. It is much more unclear whether non-motor symptoms like dysautonomia, insomnia, day-time sleepiness, fatigue, pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms respond to levodopa. Autonomic symptoms include dizziness because of orthostatic hypotension, constipation, nausea, voiding symptoms and increased sweating. Such symptoms as well as sensory symptoms like hyposmia and pain are very frequently reported in PD and seem to occur early in the disease process. Braak proposed a sequential model of neuropathology in PD starting with affection of the olfactory bulb and the autonomic innervation of the heart and gut. Affection of SN is seen from Braak stage 3, and limbic and cortical structures are affected in the later stages of the disease. Currently, the evidence for sensory and autonomic involvement in PD is reviewed with special focus on the early phase of the disease.

20635186|t|The status of olfactory function and the striatal dopaminergic system in drug-induced parkinsonism.
20635186|a|Olfactory impairment has been reported in drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP), but the relationship between dopaminergic dysfunction and smell deficits in DIP patients has not been characterized. To this end, we studied 16 DIP patients and 13 patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) using the "Sniffin' Sticks" test and [(123)I] FP-CIT SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography). DIP patients were divided based on normal (n = 9) and abnormal (n = 7) putamen dopamine transporter binding. Nineteen healthy age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls of smell function. Patients with DIP and pathological putamen uptake had abnormal olfactory function. In this group of patients, olfactory TDI scores (odor threshold, discrimination and identification) correlated significantly with putamen uptake values, as observed in PD patients. By contrast, DIP patients with normal putamen uptake showed odor functions-with the exception of the threshold subtest-similar to control subjects. In this group of patients, no significant correlation was observed between olfactory TDI scores and putamen uptake values. The results of our study suggest that the presence of smell deficits in DIP patients might be more associated with dopaminergic loss rather than with a drug-mediated dopamine receptor blockade. These preliminary results might have prognostic and therapeutic implications, as abnormalities in these individuals may be suggestive of an underlying PD-like neurodegenerative process.

20642073|t|Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: diagnosis and management.
20642073|a|BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) are a key determinant of health, quality of life (QoL) and societal cost of PD. They are often less appreciated than motor symptoms but are important sources of disability for many PD patients. METHODS: Literature search was performed using the reference databases Medline, Science Citation Index and EMBASE. The keywords used were 'non-motor symptoms', Parkinson's disease, olfaction and constipation. Papers discovered by this search were reviewed, as were references cited therein. RESULTS: Contrary to common perception, many NMS of PD occur early in PD and some may even predate the diagnosis of PD that is based on motor signs. These include olfactory deficit, sleep problems such as rapid eye movement behaviour disorder, constipation and the more recently described male erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSION: There is compelling evidence that non-motor symptoms of PD play a dominant role in the QoL and disability of PD patients and the QoL of their 'informal' carers. Effective clinical management of PD therefore demands that these symptoms be identified and to the extent possible treated.

20887883|t|The challenge of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
20887883|a|The non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) are often poorly recognized and inadequately treated in contrast to motor symptoms and a modern holistic approach to treatment of PD should, therefore, include recognition and assessment of NMS. Certain aspects of the NMS complex of PD can be improved with currently available treatments, both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic, but other features may be more refractory illustrating the importance of research into more effective drug therapies for the future. The American Academy of Neurology has recently published the first task force guidelines in relation to treatment of NMS of PD.

21705022|t|Motor and non-motor correlates of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
21705022|a|Hyposmia is highly prevalent in the motor phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is an established pre-motor sign of PD that may precede the onset of motor symptoms by as long as 5 years. The data presented here are part of an ongoing study to determine the relationship of the olfactory deficit in PD with both motor and non-motor features of the disease. The study population so far includes 96 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD (UK PD Society Brain Bank criteria; mean age 64.9 years; mean disease duration 4.8 years). Olfactory testing was performed using the 40-item UPSIT. We analyzed the relationship between UPSIT scores and measures of motor (disease duration, stage and severity) and non-motor (cognitive function, depression, anxiety and sleep) function. In 60 PD patients, [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT scans were available to assess the relationship between UPSIT scores and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding. Preliminary analyses revealed correlations of the olfactory deficit in PD with both motor and non-motor features, as well as with striatal DAT binding. These data suggest that the olfactory deficit in PD is not stationary by the time the motor phase is entered, but continues to progress over time. Hyposmia may therefore be useful as a marker of disease progression, at least in the early disease stages.

22050951|t|Parkinson's disease: acquired frailty of archaic neural networks?
22050951|a|In Parkinson's disease (PD) many motor and non-motor symptoms are difficult to explain in terms of a purely ascending degeneration process as described by Braak. This essay proposes phylogenetic considerations for consolidating the multidimensional elements of PD. Subtle clinical analysis paired with ethological comparisons as well as patho-anatomical data suggests that disrupted automatic gait control, olfactory deficits, selected visual deficits, impaired emotional face recognition, and REM sleep behavior disorder could be due to dysfunction of phylogenetically ancient networks. Neuroanatomical and behavioral findings lead to a reconsideration of the basal ganglia, to be viewed as the nuclear core of a widely distributed neural network that arborizes throughout the primordial core of the neuraxis, including the brainstem. Fragility of the resulting multiple, closed, ancillary loops that link brainstem and forebrain components of the basal ganglia may be a nodal point, pivotal to the pathogenesis of PD. Other primitive neural networks, such as those located at cardiac or gastro-intestinal levels, may share the same vulnerability. Such a network-based hypothesis overrides the need of a fixed temporal ordering of symptoms based on putative caudal-cephalic propagation patterns of pathological lesions. It also creates testable, secondary hypotheses such as differential gene expression in different neural networks, potential early epigenetic influences, concepts of "overuse" or maladaptation of primitive networks to the constraints of adult life, and system frailty due to irreparable mitochondrial "exhaustion" in highly energy consuming postmitotic cells.

22343138|t|Olfactory deficits and cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
22343138|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits and executive dysfunction have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the association between these deficits has not been thoroughly examined. METHODS: We studied 44 PD subjects and 17 age-matched controls. In PD subjects, symptoms were assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Cognition in both groups was assessed by a neuropsychological battery. Olfactory identification and sensitivity was evaluated with the Sniffin' Sticks  test and olfactory detection threshold, respectively. RESULTS: PD subjects showed significant deficits in olfactory function and working memory, executive function, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills and phonological verbal fluency tests when compared with the control group. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between olfactory sensory deficits and executive dysfunction. In PD patients with up to 12 months of motor symptoms, results were equivalent. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest a significant association between olfactory deficits and impairments of executive functions in PD.

22442429|t|Cognitive performance of GBA mutation carriers with early-onset PD: the CORE-PD study.
22442429|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the cognitive phenotype of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutation carriers with early-onset Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: We administered a neuropsychological battery and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) to participants in the CORE-PD study who were tested for mutations in PARKIN, LRRK2, and GBA. Participants included 33 GBA mutation carriers and 60 noncarriers of any genetic mutation. Primary analyses were performed on 26 GBA heterozygous mutation carriers without additional mutations and 39 age- and PD duration-matched noncarriers. Five cognitive domains, psychomotor speed, attention, memory, visuospatial function, and executive function, were created from transformed z scores of individual neuropsychological tests. Clinical diagnoses (normal, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], dementia) were assigned blind to genotype based on neuropsychological performance and functional impairment as assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. The association between GBA mutation status and neuropsychological performance, CDR, and clinical diagnoses was assessed. RESULTS: Demographics, UPSIT, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III performance did not differ between GBA carriers and noncarriers. GBA mutation carriers performed more poorly than noncarriers on the Mini-Mental State Examination (p = 0.035), and on the memory (p = 0.017) and visuospatial (p = 0.028) domains. The most prominent differences were observed in nonverbal memory performance (p < 0.001). Carriers were more likely to receive scores of 0.5 or higher on the CDR (p < 0.001), and a clinical diagnosis of either MCI or dementia (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: GBA mutation status may be an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment in patients with PD.

22921250|t|[Imaging non motor signs in Parkinson's disease].
22921250|a|Parkinson's disease is mainly considered as a motor disorder defined by a motor triad. However, various non-motor manifestations may be encountered in Parkinson's disease, including hyposmia, pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, cognitive and behavioral disorders. The pathophysiology of these signs is complex, not univocal and remains poorly understood. Functional imaging techniques either by positron emission tomography, single photon emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging provide an invaluable opportunity to better understand the pathophysiology of these signs. In this paper, we present a review of the recent advances provided by functional imaging in this area.

23279440|t|EFNS/MDS-ES/ENS [corrected] recommendations for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
23279440|a|BACKGROUND: A Task Force was convened by the EFNS/MDS-ES Scientist Panel on Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders to systemically review relevant publications on the diagnosis of PD. METHODS: Following the EFNS instruction for the preparation of neurological diagnostic guidelines, recommendation levels have been generated for diagnostic criteria and investigations. RESULTS: For the clinical diagnosis, we recommend the use of the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria (Level B). Genetic testing for specific mutations is recommended on an individual basis (Level B), taking into account specific features (i.e. family history and age of onset). We recommend olfactory testing to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian disorders including recessive forms (Level A). Screening for pre-motor PD with olfactory testing requires additional tests due to limited specificity. Drug challenge tests are not recommended for the diagnosis in de novo parkinsonian patients. There is an insufficient evidence to support their role in the differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. We recommend an assessment of cognition and a screening for REM sleep behaviour disorder, psychotic manifestations and severe depression in the initial evaluation of suspected PD cases (Level A). Transcranial sonography is recommended for the differentiation of PD from atypical and secondary parkinsonian disorders (Level A), for the early diagnosis of PD and in the detection of subjects at risk for PD (Level A), although the technique is so far not universally used and requires some expertise. Because specificity of TCS for the development of PD is limited, TCS should be used in conjunction with other screening tests. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging at 1.5 T are recommended as neuroimaging tools that can support a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy versus PD on the basis of regional atrophy and signal change as well as diffusivity patterns (Level A). DaTscan SPECT is registered in Europe and the United States for the differential diagnosis between degenerative parkinsonisms and essential tremor (Level A). More specifically, DaTscan is indicated in the presence of significant diagnostic uncertainty such as parkinsonism associated with neuroleptic exposure and atypical tremor manifestations such as isolated unilateral postural tremor. Studies of [(123) I]MIBG/SPECT cardiac uptake may be used to identify patients with PD versus controls and MSA patients (Level A). All other SPECT imaging studies do not fulfil registration standards and cannot be recommended for routine clinical use. At the moment, no conclusion can be drawn as to diagnostic efficacy of autonomic function tests, neurophysiological tests and positron emission tomography imaging in PD. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of PD is still largely based on the correct identification of its clinical features. Selected investigations (genetic, olfactory, and neuroimaging studies) have an ancillary role in confirming the diagnosis, and some of them could be possibly used in the near future to identify subjects in a pre-symptomatic phase of the disease.

23696904|t|Diagnostic value of the impairment of olfaction in Parkinson's disease.
23696904|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory impairment is increasingly recognized as an early symptom in the development of Parkinson's disease. Testing olfactory function is a non-invasive method but can be time-consuming which restricts its application in clinical settings and epidemiological studies. Here, we investigate odor identification as a supportive diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease and estimate the performance of odor subsets to allow a more rapid testing of olfactory impairment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Odor identification was assessed with 16 Sniffin' sticks in 148 Parkinson patients and 148 healthy controls. Risks of olfactory impairment were estimated with proportional odds models. Random forests were applied to classify Parkinson and non-Parkinson patients. Parkinson patients were rarely normosmic (identification of more than 12 odors; 16.8%) and identified on average seven odors whereas the reference group identified 12 odors and showed a higher prevalence of normosmy (31.1%). Parkinson patients with rigidity dominance had a twofold greater prevalence of olfactory impairment. Disease severity was associated with impairment of odor identification (per score point of the Hoehn and Yahr rating OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.26-2.77). Age-related impairment of olfaction showed a steeper gradient in Parkinson patients. Coffee, peppermint, and anise showed the largest difference in odor identification between Parkinson patients and controls. Random forests estimated a misclassification rate of 22.4% when comparing Parkinson patients with healthy controls using all 16 odors. A similar rate (23.8%) was observed when only the three aforementioned odors were applied. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that testing odor identification can be a supportive diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease. The application of only three odors performed well in discriminating Parkinson patients from controls, which can facilitate a wider application of this method as a point-of-care test.

23697298|t|[A review of the oro-dento-facial characteristics of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III (familial dysautonomia)].
23697298|a|The oro-dento-facial features and dysfunction of children with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type Ill, known as familial dysautonomia or Riley-Day syndrome, was first described in the scientific literature in 1949. They include dental trauma; dental and soft tissue self-mutilation; normal dental age; normal sequence and timing of eruption and exfoliation of teeth; smaller tooth size; different and disproportional tooth components; normal alveolar bone height; small jaws, mild crowding, and malocclusions. These persons have craniofacial morphology that is different from accepted norms but they resemble norms of their ethnic origin. The subjects can have gray, pale, shiny faces with an asymmetric suffering expression; frontal bossing, with eventual hypertelorism and narrow lips; a low caries rate; drooling, and hypersalivation. They can have changes in salivary composition and content, which influences plaque and calculus and increases the risk of gingival and periodontal diseases. They also have difficulty in controlling oral muscles; a progressive decrease in number of tongue fungiform papillae, accompanied by lack of taste buds; and specific dysgeusia, but a normal sense of smell.

23937295|t|Olfactory dysfunction in sporadic Parkinson's Disease and LRRK2 carriers.
23937295|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the sense of smell in LRRK2 mutation carriers and in patients with sporadic PD (sPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 343 individuals were included: 275 sPD of whom 90 were de novo patients with sPD, 17 LRRK2 PD, 36 healthy LRRK2 mutation carriers, and 15 healthy family members without mutation. All subjects underwent neurologic examination and olfactory sense testing with B-SIT (a 12-item test). Linear regression analysis was applied to build different models with B-SIT as dependent variable. RESULTS: Sporadic PD had significantly lower scores in olfaction compared with LRRK2 PD (P < 0.001). B-SIT scores were lowest in medicated sPD, and higher scores were found in de novo patients. LRRK2 PD had similar sense of smell to healthy LRRK2 mutation carriers and to healthy family members without mutation when adjusting for age. CONCLUSION: Hyposmia was pronounced already at time of diagnosis in the sPD cases but was not present in healthy LRRK2 mutation carriers and less pronounced in LRRK2 PD compared with sporadic cases. Smell testing may be a preclinical marker in sporadic PD but does not seem applicable in LRRK2 cases.

23938227|t|Prevalence and clinical course of olfactory hallucinations in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
23938227|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory hallucinations are known to occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) but are much less well-described than visual hallucinations. OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence, clinical features, response to treatment and prognosis of olfactory hallucinations in IPD. METHODS: 205 consecutively reviewed IPD patients and 205 non-IPD control patients attending the local hospital were surveyed for the presence of olfactory hallucinations by specific questioning; the IPD patients were followed up for at least three years. RESULTS: Of 188 patients who had a clinical course remaining consistent with IPD, four were initially found to have olfactory hallucinations, yielding a prevalence of 2.1% (95% confidence interval 0.4-5.4%). Two further patients developed such hallucinations later during the study. Olfactory hallucinations were not always accompanied by other hallucination modalities. The patients had a long duration of disease treated with dopaminergic medication, loss of sense of smell typical for IPD, no dementia or features suggestive of non-idiopathic PD after three years follow-up, a lack of insight into their hallucinations with consequent failure to report them spontaneously, and a good and lasting response to modest doses of atypical antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the significant prevalence of olfactory hallucinations, describes their clinical features and indicates that they may occur in isolation and not predict other psychotic or dementing features. The nuisance that such hallucinations cause, their ease of treatment and their failure to be volunteered as a symptom means that specific questioning for their presence should be included in routine assessment of patients with IPD.

23979248|t|[Classification of reduced sense of smell in women with Parkinson's disease].
23979248|a|AIM: It is well known that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) prominently experience difficulty in smelling, a nonmotor symptom, without any signs or symptoms from an early stage. However, no study on the classification of the reduced sense of smell has been performed. We compared the classification of reduced sense of smell (bromine) between PD patients and healthy subjects to clarify the disorder profile. METHODS: The subjects were 14 female neurology outpatients clinically diagnosed with PD (mean age: 71.6 +- 6.1 years) and 11 female elderly healthy subjects without any psychiatric or neurological disorders (mean age: 68.9 +- 6.9 years). In this study, the Japanese odor stick identification test was used. RESULTS: Both the PD patients and the healthy subjects showed a reduced sense of smell for the bromine of lumber, orange, and domestic gas. The PD patients preserved a sense of smell for perfume, but they showed a significantly lower sense of smell than the healthy subjects for the bromine of China ink, menthol, curry, rose, cypress, sweaty socks, and condensed milk; this indicates that bromine can be a supportive diagnostic index for PD. CONCLUSION: It was considered important to evaluate the reduced sense of smell in PD patients to avoid hazards in their daily lives and to conduct an effective rehabilitation program.

24629799|t|Olfactory performance in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 patients.
24629799|a|A large body of evidence has shown olfactory deficits in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the nature of the olfactory impairment remains poorly understood partly because the majority of studies have only explored smell identification capabilities. The purpose of the present study was twofold. First we wanted to test if patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and visual loss, also have olfactory deficits. Secondly, we wanted to test the nature of the olfactory deficits by testing not only the identification level but also olfactory threshold and discrimination. Based on the olfactory dysfunction found in different neurodegenerative diseases and functional neuroimaging data showing cerebellar activation during olfaction, we hypothesized that SCA7 patients would show an olfactory impairment. To test this hypothesis we studied twenty-eight genetically confirmed SCA7 patients and twenty-seven matched controls using the Sniffing Sticks Test and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The results show that SCA7 patients' ability to discriminate and identify odors is significantly impaired, although their odor detection thresholds were at normal levels. These results suggest that SCA7 neurological damage affects olfactory perception but spares the patients' olfactory sensory capabilities.

24978368|t|Premotor and nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease.
24978368|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights recent advances in premotor and nonmotor features in Parkinson's disease, focusing on these issues in the context of prodromal and early-stage Parkinson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Although Parkinson's disease patients experience a wide range of nonmotor symptoms throughout the disease course, studies demonstrate that nonmotor features are not solely a late manifestation. Indeed, disturbances of smell, sleep, mood, and gastrointestinal function may herald Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies and precede these neurodegenerative conditions by 5 or more years. In addition, other nonmotor symptoms such as cognitive impairment are now recognized in incident or de-novo Parkinson's disease cohorts. Many of these nonmotor features reflect disturbances in nondopaminergic systems and early involvement of peripheral and central nervous systems, including olfactory, enteric, and brainstem neurons as in Braak's proposed pathological staging of Parkinson's disease. Current research focuses on identifying potential biomarkers that may detect persons at risk for Parkinson's disease and permit early intervention with neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapeutics. SUMMARY: Recent studies provide new insights into the frequency, pathophysiology, and importance of nonmotor features in Parkinson's disease as well as the recognition that these nonmotor symptoms occur in premotor, early, and later phases of Parkinson's disease.

25280862|t|Taste in Parkinson's disease.
25280862|a|Parkinson's disease is now considered a complex systemic disease also characterized by the occurrence of a variety of non-motor symptoms. Among them, a chemosensory impairment defined as a deficient olfactory performance is now acknowledged to be one of the prevalent symptoms since the early stages of the disease. Less clear are the incidence, extent and pathophysiology of taste function. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the state of the art in taste literature. To provide a better understanding of the available results, we will also discuss the different methods for taste evaluation and the other potential confounders to be addressed by future research.

25330404|t|Nonmotor symptoms in LRRK2 G2019S associated Parkinson's disease.
25330404|a|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and LRRK2-associated PD (LRRK2-PD) might be expected to differ clinically since the neuropathological substrate of LRRK2-PD is heterogeneous. The range and severity of extra-nigral nonmotor features associated with LRRK2 mutations is also not well-defined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and time of onset of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in LRRK2-PD patients. METHODS: The presence of hyposmia and of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic and sleep disturbances was assessed in 33 LRRK2-G2019S-PD patients by standardized questionnaires and validated scales. Thirty-three IPD patients, matched for age, gender, duration of parkinsonism and disease severity and 33 healthy subjects were also evaluated. RESULTS: University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) scores in LRRK2-G2019S-PD were higher than those in IPD (23.5+-6.8 vs 18.4+-6.0; p = 0.002), and hyposmia was less frequent in G2019S carriers than in IPD (39.4% vs 75.8%; p = 0.01). UPSIT scores were significantly higher in females than in males in LRRK2-PD patients (26.9+-4.7 vs 19.4+-6.8; p<0.01). The frequency of sleep and neuropsychiatric disturbances and of dysautonomic symptoms in LRRK2-G2019S-PD was not significantly different from that in IPD. Hyposmia, depression, constipation and excessive daytime sleepiness, were reported to occur before the onset of classical motor symptoms in more than 40% of LRRK2-PD patients in whom these symptoms were present at the time of examination. CONCLUSION: Neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic and sleep disturbances occur as frequently in patients with LRRK2-G2019S-PD as in IPD but smell loss was less frequent in LRRK2-PD. Like in IPD, disturbances such as hyposmia, depression, constipation and excessive daytime sleepiness may antedate the onset of classical motor symptoms in LRRK2-G2019S-PD.

25515307|t|Olfactory function in elderly people and patients with Alzheimer's disease.
25515307|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory function is an important sensory perception function that helps us detect the smell of spoiled food, dirty clothing, and gas leaks. If ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are accompanied by a decline in olfactory function, this might reduce the ability to sense danger, placing the safety and hygiene of elderly people at risk. METHODS: Subjects in this study included 113 healthy subjects aged 20-89 years and 12 persons with AD aged 62-85 years. The healthy subjects were divided into three groups according to age: young-adult group (20-43 years), middle-adult group (45-69 years), and old-adult group (70-89 years). The Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised score of AD subjects ranged from 15 to 26. We developed and implemented an odour identification ability test and a situational judgement test using an odour stick to examine the impact of ageing and AD on olfactory function from the perspective of sensing danger. To examine the impact of mild AD on the olfactory function, we compared the scores between the AD group and the age-matched control group. RESULTS: The scores for the situational judgement and odour identification ability tests were significantly lower in an old-adult group than in the young-adult and middle-adult groups. A significant correlation was found between age and scores for both tests in the control group. The AD group exhibited significantly lower total scores on both tests compared with the age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ageing and mild AD may reduce the ability to identify odours and judge situations based on odours.

25546094|t|A population-based study on combined markers for early Parkinson's disease.
25546094|a|The prerequisite for an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) are markers that are both sensitive and specific for clinically definite PD and its prediagnosic phases. Promising candidates include enlarged hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (SN+) on transcranial sonography (TCS) and hyposmia. However, despite good sensitivity and specificity, both markers have yet failed to yield reliable predictions. We pursue the possibility of combined use in an ongoing population-based cohort. Subjects were recruited from 10,000 inhabitants of Luebeck/Germany aged 50 to 79 years and additional PD patients from our outpatient clinic. After neurological examination, 715 subjects were grouped into clinically definite PD (n = 106), possible prediagnostic PD (ppPD; n = 73), and a control group subdivided into healthy individuals (n = 283) and controls with diseases other than PD (n = 253). Subjects underwent TCS and smell testing. Sensitivity and specificity of SN+ and hyposmia were good for PD; however, positive predictive values (PPV) of both SN+ (5.2%) and olfaction (2.5%) were low. At least one positive/both positive markers were present in 33%/1% of healthy controls, 33%/2% of diseased controls, 62%/7% of ppPD, and 94%/51% of PD. When combining SN+ and hyposmia, PPV increased to 17.6%, with a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 98%. Both SN+ and hyposmia offer good enrichment towards PD and ppPD, are stable against other diseases, and the combination of markers highly increases specificity. However, if the combination of SN+ and hyposmia were used as criterion for PD diagnosis, almost half of clinically definite PD and more than 90% of ppPD would have been missed.

25850354|t|Influences of hormone replacement therapy on olfactory and cognitive function in postmenopausal women.
25850354|a|Olfactory dysfunction can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease. Since hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may protect against Alzheimer's disease in postmenopausal women, the question arises as to whether it also protects against olfactory dysfunction in such women. A total of three olfactory and 12 neurocognitive tests were administered to 432 healthy postmenopausal women with varied HRT histories. Serum levels of reproductive hormones were obtained for all subjects; APOE-epsilon4 haplotype was determined for 77 women. National Adult Reading Test and Odor Memory/Discrimination Test scores were positively influenced by HRT. Odor Identification and Odor Memory/Discrimination Test scores were lower for women who scored poorly on a delayed recall test, a surrogate for mild cognitive impairment. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Revised, as a Neuropsychological Instrument Spatial Span Backwards Test scores were higher in women receiving estrogen and progestin HRT and directly correlated with serum testosterone levels, the latter implying a positive effect of testosterone on spatial memory. APOE-epsilon4 was associated with poorer odor threshold test scores. These data suggest that HRT positively influences a limited number of olfactory and cognitive measures during menopause.

26482690|t|Olfactory Function, Eating Ability, and Visceral Obesity Associated with MMSE Three Years after Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis.
26482690|a|OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether risk factors for poor nutrition are associated with global cognitive function three years after confirmed Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis. DESIGN: The follow-up investigations for this prospective community-based study were conducted three years after PD diagnosis. SETTING: The study participants lived in Vasterbotten County, a region in northern Sweden with 142,000 inhabitants. PARTICIPANTS: This study population consisted of 118 PD outpatients from the study of Newly Diagnosed PD in Umea (NYPUM). MEASUREMENTS: Global cognition was assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline and at follow-up. Anthropometry, nutrition (Mini Nutritional Assessment, MNA, 3-day food registration, 3-FDR), olfactory function (Brief Smell Identification Test, B-SIT), and swallowing, cutting food, and salivation (single questions from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS) were used as markers for nutritional status. RESULTS: The MMSE score decreased over three years (-1.06+-3.38, p=0.001). Olfactory function at baseline was associated to MMSE at three years (B=0.365, p=0.004). Changes in waist/hip ratio (B=113.29, p=0.017), swallowing (B=1.18, P=0.033), and cutting food (B=-1.80, p=0.000) were associated with MMSE at follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that olfactory function, cutting food, swallowing, and visceral obesity are associated with MMSE three years after PD diagnosis.

26639980|t|Loss of awareness of hyposmia is associated with mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.
26639980|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, patients with PD are sometimes unaware of their olfactory dysfunction, resulting in an under-diagnosis of this symptom. To determine whether the loss of awareness of hyposmia results from cognitive impairment in patients with PD, we investigated the relationship between the degree of hyposmia self-awareness and the cognitive status of non-demented PD patients. METHODS: Thirty-one non-demented patients with PD and 20 healthy controls (HC) were assessed via a self-reported olfactory questionnaire and an odor identification test. PD patients were sub-classified as having mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or as cognitively normal (PD-CN) (according to the current PD-MCI criteria). We compared the degree of hyposmia self-awareness between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups. RESULTS: The PD-MCI group scored the lowest on the odor identification test among all groups, whereas PD-MCI patients tended to rate their olfactory function higher on the self-reported olfactory questionnaire than PD-CN patients. Differences in the scores of subjective and objective olfactory measures between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups were significant (p = 0.0069). CONCLUSIONS: The loss of awareness of hyposmia is closely associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD patients.

26810729|t|Taste dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.
26810729|a|Empirical studies of taste function in multiple sclerosis (MS) are rare. Moreover, a detailed assessment of whether quantitative measures of taste function correlate with the punctate and patchy myelin-related lesions found throughout the CNS of MS patients has not been made. We administered a 96-trial test of sweet (sucrose), sour (citric acid), bitter (caffeine) and salty (NaCl) taste perception to the left and right anterior (CN VII) and posterior (CN IX) tongue regions of 73 MS patients and 73 matched controls. The number and volume of lesions were assessed using quantitative MRI in 52 brain regions of 63 of the MS patients. Taste identification scores were significantly lower in the MS patients for sucrose (p = 0.0002), citric acid (p = 0.0001), caffeine (p = 0.0372) and NaCl (p = 0.0004) and were present in both anterior and posterior tongue regions. The percent of MS patients with identification scores falling below the 5th percentile of controls was 15.07 % for caffeine, 21.9 % for citric acid, 24.66 % for sucrose, and 31.50 % for NaCl. Such scores were inversely correlated with lesion volumes in the temporal, medial frontal, and superior frontal lobes, and with the number of lesions in the left and right superior frontal lobes, right anterior cingulate gyrus, and left parietal operculum. Regardless of the subject group, women outperformed men on the taste measures. These findings indicate that a sizable number of MS patients exhibit taste deficits that are associated with MS-related lesions throughout the brain.

27003274|t|Back on the scent: the olfactory system in CNS demyelinating diseases.
27003274|a|Olfactory dysfunction is recognised across an ever broadening spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions including central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). In this review, we unravel the striking evidence highlighting how olfactory loss is a common clinical feature in MS and NMO. We provide an overview of the supportive psychophysical, electrophysiological, radiological and pathological data that point to the anatomical substrate of olfactory deficits in these diseases. The pattern of underlying pathology affecting the olfactory system is shown to be complex, involving multiple structures that are affected in different ways throughout the course of the disease. This review is the first to synthesise the expanding body of literature on the topic, provides novel insight into the way in which the olfactory system is affected in CNS demyelinating diseases, and raises intriguing questions about the role of this system in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

28509336|t|Application of the movement disorder society prodromal Parkinson's disease research criteria in 2 independent prospective cohorts.
28509336|a|BACKGROUND: The research criteria for prodromal PD of the MDS propose a new approach for the assessment of the individual probability of prodromal PD. These criteria require a testing of their reliability in different prospective cohorts. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the MDS prodromal PD criteria in 2 independent prospective studies. METHODS: Prodromal PD probabilities of the Tubingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration cohort (TREND study, n = 650, recruited by the presence of probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression, and/or hyposmia or none of these at baseline and 2-, 4-, and 6-year follow-up) and the population-based Prospective Evaluation of Risk Factors for Idiopathic Parkinson's Syndrome cohort (PRIPS Tubingen subsample; n = 715, baseline and 3- and 5-year follow-up) were calculated. Baseline posttest probabilities, time to PD diagnosis, marker constellations, and longitudinal changes of prodromal PD probabilities were analyzed. RESULTS: Incident PD cases (TREND, n = 10; PRIPS = 7) showed significantly higher likelihood ratios of risk and prodromal markers at baseline when compared with nonconverters. Only 2 of 17 incident PD cases met the criteria for probable prodromal PD (ie, posttest probability > 80%) and 5 had possible prodromal PD (ie, > 50%) 1.4 to 3.8 years before diagnosis. The criteria showed high specificity and negative predictive values (>98%), but low sensitivity (TREND, 30%; PRIPS, 14%) and positive predictive values (TREND, 19%, PRIPS, 50%). The individual risk for prodromal PD in incident PD cases showed an inverse correlation with the time to conversion (Spearman rho = .80, P = .006) and unlike in nonconverters, increased during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The MDS prodromal criteria provide a practical framework for the calculation of prodromal PD risk. Although specificity of the criteria is high, most patients will not meet the criteria before diagnosis unless testing is thoroughly performed with numerous and highly specific markers objectively assessed.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

28522171|t|Brain correlates of progressive olfactory loss in Parkinson's disease.
28522171|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is present in a large proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) upon diagnosis. However, its progression over time has been poorly investigated. The few available longitudinal studies lack control groups or MRI data. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the olfactory changes and their structural correlates in non-demented PD over a four-year follow-up. METHODS: We assessed olfactory function in a sample of 25 PD patients and 24 normal controls of similar age using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification test (UPSIT). Structural magnetic resonance imaging data, obtained with a 3-T Siemens Trio scanner, were analyzed using FreeSurfer software. RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed significant group (F = 53.882; P < 0.001) and time (F = 6.203; P = 0.016) effects, but the group-by-time interaction was not statistically significant. UPSIT performance declined >=1.5 standard deviations in 5 controls and 7 patients. Change in UPSIT scores of patients correlated positively with volume change in the left putamen, right thalamus, and right caudate nucleus. CONCLUSION: Olfactory loss over time in PD and controls is similar, but we have observed significant correlation between this loss and basal ganglia volumes only in patients.

28554413|t|The Nonmotor Features of Parkinson's Disease.
28554413|a|Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) were recognized by the great James Parkinson himself who mentioned symptoms such as sleep dysfunction, delirium, dementia, and dysautonomia, in his seminal 1817 essay, "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy" (Parkinson, 1817). In spite of the key impact of PD NMS on quality of life, there was little holistic research and awareness till the validation and use of comprehensive tools such as the NMS questionnaire, scale, and the revised version of the unified PD rating scale. Research studies using these tools highlighted the key impact of the burden of NMS on quality of life of PD patients and the need for NMS to be routinely assessed in clinic. We now define PD as a motor and nonmotor disorder, and the natural history includes a long prodromal phase of PD dominated by a range of NMS. The prodromal phase is the subject of much research particularly in relation to neuroprotection and identifying subjects at risk. Use of NMS tools has also validated burden grading of NMS with cutoff values, which can be used as outcome measure in clinical trials. Finally, the complex multineurotransmitter dysfunction that is seen in PD has been shown to manifest clinically as nonmotor subtypes. Recognition of such subtypes is likely to lead to the emergence of personalized and precision medicine in PD.

28592904|t|Non-motor features of Parkinson disease.
28592904|a|Many of the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) can be preceded, sometimes for several years, by non-motor symptoms that include hyposmia, sleep disorders, depression and constipation. These non-motor features appear across the spectrum of patients with PD, including individuals with genetic causes of PD. The neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological bases of non-motor abnormalities in PD remain largely undefined. Here, we discuss recent advances that have helped to establish the presence, severity and effect on the quality of life of non-motor symptoms in PD, and the neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological mechanisms involved. We also discuss the potential for the non-motor features to define a prodrome that may enable the early diagnosis of PD.

28644969|t|Premotor symptoms and the risk of Parkinson's disease: A case-control study in Mexican population.
28644969|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of pre-motor symptoms and estimate the risk for developing Parkinson's disease in Mexican population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control study was carried out with consecutive subjects with Parkinson's disease from two different referral centers in Mexico. Gender- and age-matched controls were randomly selected from the participating hospitals. All subjects were assessed using a structured questionnaire for the assessment of pre-motor symptoms (hyposmia, depression, anxiety, constipation, and sleep disorders). Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 430 subjects with PD and 430 healthy subjects were included. Premotor symptoms prevalence was 77.7% (n=334) for the PD group, compared to 41.3% (n=178) in the control group (p<0.001). After logistic multivariate analysis, previous history of hyposmia (OR 2.02 [95% CI 1.33-3.06]), depression (OR 2.52 [95% CI 1.67-3.84]), anxiety (OR 4.37 [95% CI 2.73-6.98]) and sleep disorders (OR 2.03 [95% CI 1.41-2.93]) were independently associated with Parkinson's disease. Overall prediction success of the model was 81.2% for controls and 61.2% for subjects with PD. CONCLUSION: All five premotor symptoms assessed were more commonly reported in PD subjects than healthy controls. The presence of non-motor symptoms yield a prediction success of 71.2% to discriminate between PD subjects and healthy controls.

28651678|a|OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is an important aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is considerable heterogeneity in its presentation. This investigation aims to identify and characterize latent cognitive phenotypes in early PD. METHODS: Latent class analysis, a data-driven, person-centered, cluster analysis was performed on cognitive data from the Parkinson's Progressive Markers Initiative baseline visit. This analytic method facilitates identification of naturally occurring endophenotypes. Resulting classes were compared across biomarker, symptom, and demographic data. RESULTS: Six cognitive phenotypes were identified. Three demonstrated consistent performance across indicators, representing poor ("Weak-Overall"), average ("Typical-Overall"), and strong ("Strong-Overall") cognition. The remaining classes demonstrated unique patterns of cognition, characterized by "Strong-Memory," "Weak-Visuospatial," and "Amnestic" profiles. The Amnestic class evidenced greater tremor severity and anosmia, but was unassociated with biomarkers linked with Alzheimer's disease. The Weak-Overall class was older and reported more non-motor features associated with cognitive decline, including anxiety, depression, autonomic dysfunction, anosmia, and REM sleep behaviors. The Strong-Overall class was younger, more female, and reported less dysautonomia and anosmia. Classes were unrelated to disease duration, functional independence, or available biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Latent cognitive phenotypes with focal patterns of impairment were observed in recently diagnosed individuals with PD. Cognitive profiles were found to be independent of traditional biomarkers and motoric indices of disease progression. Only globally impaired class was associated with previously reported indicators of cognitive decline, suggesting this group may drive the effects reported in studies using variable-based analysis. Longitudinal and neuroanatomical characterization of classes will yield further insight into the evolution of cognitive change in the disease. (JINS, 2017, 23, 551-563).

28802922|t|Biomarkers of Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.
28802922|a|Biomarkers are helpful for early diagnosis, assessment of disorder severity, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy. Given that early therapeutic intervention may be useful in forestalling or slowing neurodegenerative conditions, employing reliable biomarkers to identify asymptomatic individuals who are destined to develop clinical Parkinson's disease (PD) is critical. Two important observations have been repeatedly found in persons who eventually develop clinical PD: (1) significant neuronal loss occurs in the substantia nigra and (2) the presence of nonmotor symptoms (NMS). Each of these findings occurs prior to the development of motor signs and symptoms, often preceding the clinical diagnosis of PD by a decade or more. As such, NMS themselves, and factors associated with their development may be useful clinical biomarkers for predicting future development of motor PD. Recently, research criteria for prodromal PD, defined as presence of motor and/or NMS, but not yet fulfilling the classic PD diagnosis, have been proposed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force. Although there are a small number of biomarkers associated with NMS of PD, in this chapter, discussion follows concerning the expanding literature associated with clinical, biochemical, imaging, and genetic biomarkers of NMS in patients with PD.

28802936|t|Nonmotor Symptoms in Experimental Models of Parkinson's Disease.
28802936|a|Nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) range from neuropsychiatric, cognitive to sleep and sensory disorders and can arise from the disease process as well as from drug treatment. The clinical heterogeneity of nonmotor symptoms of PD is underpinned by a wide range of neuropathological and molecular pathology, affecting almost the entire range of neurotransmitters present in brain and the periphery. Understanding the neurobiology and pathology of nonmotor symptoms is crucial to the effective treatment of PD and currently a key unmet need. This bench-to-bedside translational concept can only be successful if robust animal models of PD charting the genesis and natural history of nonmotor symptoms can be devised. Toxin-based and transgenic rodent and primate models of PD have given us important clues to the underlying basis of motor symptomatology and in addition, can provide a snapshot of some nonmotor aspects of PD, although the data are far from complete. In this chapter, we discuss some of the nonmotor aspects of the available experimental models of PD and how the development of robust animal models to understand and treat nonmotor symptoms needs to become a research priority.

28864676|t|A predictive model to identify Parkinson disease from administrative claims data.
28864676|a|OBJECTIVE: To use administrative medical claims data to identify patients with incident Parkinson disease (PD) prior to diagnosis. METHODS: Using a population-based case-control study of incident PD in 2009 among Medicare beneficiaries aged 66-90 years (89,790 cases, 118,095 controls) and the elastic net algorithm, we developed a cross-validated model for predicting PD using only demographic data and 2004-2009 Medicare claims data. We then compared this model to more basic models containing only demographic data and diagnosis codes for constipation, taste/smell disturbance, and REM sleep behavior disorder, using each model's receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We observed all established associations between PD and age, sex, race/ethnicity, tobacco smoking, and the above medical conditions. A model with those predictors had an AUC of only 0.670 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.668-0.673). In contrast, the AUC for a predictive model with 536 diagnosis and procedure codes was 0.857 (95% CI 0.855-0.859). At the optimal cut point, sensitivity was 73.5% and specificity was 83.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Using only demographic data and selected diagnosis and procedure codes readily available in administrative claims data, it is possible to identify individuals with a high probability of eventually being diagnosed with PD.

29070942|t|Odor selectivity of hyposmia and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease.
29070942|a|OBJECTIVE: Hyposmia is one of the earliest non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and can precede the onset of motor symptoms by years. Most of the current olfactory detection tests are targeted at Western populations. The exact relationship between hyposmia and cognitive impairment is unknown. The purpose of the study was to find bromines that can effectively identify olfactory dysfunction and investigate the relationship between hyposmia and cognitive function in early, non-demented, drug-naive patients with PD in the People's Republic of China. METHODS: Sixty-three early, non-demented, drug-naive patients with PD and 55 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The T&T olfactometer and a Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were applied to assess subjects' olfactory and cognitive functions. Patients with PD also completed the Modified Unified Parkinson's disease-rating scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. RESULTS: Patients with PD had lower scores of visuospatial and executive function (p=0.000), attention (p=0.03), and delayed recall (p=0.001) than controls. beta-phenylethyl alcohol (floral smell, smell of rose petals) and isovaleric acid (smell of sweat, stuffy socks) were more sensitive for identifying hyposmia in patients with PD than three other odors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that impaired visuospatial and executive function was associated with hyposmia (p=0.013), but was independent of other PD-associated variables. CONCLUSION: Hyposmia was common in early, non-demented, drug-naive PD patients. beta-Phenylethyl alcohol and isovaleric acid were more superior for identifying hyposmia in early non-demented Chinese patients with PD. Hyposmia was associated with impaired visuospatial and executive function in patients with PD. Further prospective studies that apply a series of neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging methods in large samples in multicenter studies are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate the relationship between hyposmia and cognitive function with disease progression in patients with PD.

29154293|t|The Changing Landscape of Parkinson Epidemiologic Research.
29154293|a|Despite recent successes in understanding the genetics of Parkinson's disease (PD), the causes of late-onset sporadic PD remain elusive. Many of the epidemiologic findings on PD etiology have been challenged by alternative explanations such as reverse causation. This is mainly because PD often takes decades to develop before it can be diagnosed late in life. Convincing evidence shows that this prodromal stage of PD is characterized by various prodromal symptoms such as olfactory impairment and rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). As they likely reflect PD pathogenesis years, if not decades, before nigrostriatal involvement, research on these symptoms may represent an unprecedented opportunity to dissect the etiology of PD. Using PD prodromal symptoms as intermediate phenotypes, we may be able to identify factors that contribute to the development of these symptoms and factors that modify their progression to clinical PD. Further, this line of research will also enable examinations of novel etiological hypotheses of PD development such as the microbiome and prion hypotheses. In this article, the author used olfactory impairment and RBD as examples to illustrate the promises and challenges of epidemiologic research on prodromal symptoms to understand PD etiology.

29304050|t|Severe hyposmia and aberrant functional connectivity in cognitively normal Parkinson's disease.
29304050|a|OBJECTIVE: Severe hyposmia is a risk factor of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD), while the underlying functional connectivity (FC) and brain volume alterations in PD patients with severe hyposmia (PD-SH) are unclear. METHODS: We examined voxel-based morphometric and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging findings in 15 cognitively normal PD-SH, 15 cognitively normal patients with PD with no/mild hyposmia (PD-N/MH), and 15 healthy controls (HCs). RESULTS: Decreased gray matter volume (GMV) was observed in the bilateral cuneus, right associative visual area, precuneus, and some areas in anterior temporal lobes in PD-SH group compared to HCs. Both the PD-SH and PD-N/MH groups showed increased GMV in the bilateral posterior insula and its surrounding regions. A widespread significant decrease in amygdala FC beyond the decreased GMV areas and olfactory cortices were found in the PD-SH group compared with the HCs. Above all, decreased amygdala FC with the inferior parietal lobule, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus was significantly correlated with both reduction of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised scores and severity of hyposmia in all participants. Canonical resting state networks exhibited decreased FC in the precuneus and left executive control networks but increased FC in the primary and high visual networks of patients with PD compared with HCs. Canonical network FC to other brain regions was enhanced in the executive control, salience, primary visual, and visuospatial networks of the PD-SH. CONCLUSION: PD-SH showed extensive decreased amygdala FC. Particularly, decreased FC between the amygdala and inferior parietal lobule, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus were associated with the severity of hyposmia and cognitive performance. In contrast, relatively preserved canonical networks in combination with increased FC to brain regions outside of canonical networks may be related to compensatory mechanisms, and preservation of brain function.

29683408|a|AIM: Complaints about Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol (CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex ; GW Pharma Ltd, Salisbury, UK) in the management of multiple sclerosis spasticity include unpleasant taste and oral mucosal anomalies. This pilot study assessed the use of sugar-free chewing gum and/or a refrigerated bottle of THC:CBD oromucosal spray to mitigate these effects. MATERIALS & METHODS: Patients with multiple sclerosis spasticity (n = 52) at six sites in Italy who were receiving THC:CBD oromucosal spray and had associated oral mucosal effects were randomized into Group A (chewing gum; n = 15); Group B (cold bottle; n = 20); and Group C (cold bottle + chewing gum; n = 17). RESULTS: Taste perception in patients receiving chewing gum +- cold bottle intervention (Groups A and C combined) was significantly (p = 0.0001) improved from baseline to week 4 while maintaining spasticity control. CONCLUSION: Patient comfort, satisfaction and treatment adherence may benefit from these interventions.

30076266|t|Non-motor features of Parkinson's disease in a nested case-control study of US men.
30076266|a|BACKGROUND: Several non-motor features may individually contribute to identify prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD), but little is known on how they interact. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in a large cohort of men age 40-75 at recruitment in 1986. Cases (n=120) had confirmed PD, were<85 in January 2012, returned a 2012 questionnaire with questions on probable rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and constipation sent to all cohort participants and completed in 2014 the Brief Smell Identification Test and a questionnaire assessing parkinsonism and other non-motor PD features (including depressive symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired colour vision and body pain). Controls (n=6479) met the same criteria as cases, except for the PD diagnosis. RESULTS: Concurrent constipation, probable RBD and hyposmia were present in 29.3% of cases and 1.1% of controls, yielding an age-adjusted OR of 160(95%CI 72.8to353) for three features versus none. The odds of PD increased exponentially with additional non-motor features (OR for 6-7 features versus none: 1325; 95%CI333to5279). Among men without PD, the number of non-motor features was associated with odds of parkinsonism (OR for 6-7 features versus none: 89; 95%CI21.2to375). We estimated that in a population with a prodromal PD prevalence of 2%, concurrent constipation, probable RBD and hyposmia would have a maximum sensitivity of 29% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 35%. The PPV could increase up to 70% by including additional features, but with sharply decreased sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent constipation, probable RBD and hyposmia are strongly associated with PD. Because these features often precede motor symptoms and their co-occurrence could provide an efficient method for early PD identification.

30135017|t|Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level may be associated with olfactory dysfunction in de novo Parkinson's disease.
30135017|a|The purpose of our study was to investigate the association between olfactory function in Parkinson's disease (PD) and serum vitamin D status. Thirty-nine patients with de novo PD were enrolled in this study. Olfactory function was assessed by an odor identification test, as a part of the KVSS (Korean version of sniffin' sticks) II test. All patients were also assessed with the NMSS (Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for PD) to check the subjective change in ability to smell. Vitamin D status was determined by measuring the level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OHD3). Multiple linear regression tests and correlation analysis were applied to verify the association between serum 25-OHD3 level and patients' subjective and objective olfactory dysfunction. The serum 25-OHD3 level was independently associated with odor identification score in patients with PD (beta = 0.38, p < 0.01). Another statistically significant variable was clinical subtype of PD (Intermediate subtype: beta = -0.33, p < 0.05; Akinetic rigid type: beta = -0.55, p < 0.01). The serum 25-OHD3 level was also negatively correlated with the score for item number 28 in NMSS (Spearman's rho = -0.32, p < 0.05). Our results showed that vitamin D status might be an independent factor for olfactory dysfunction in PD. Although the underlying mechanism has not been clearly identified, we postulate that vitamin D plays a role in the pathogenesis of olfactory dysfunction in PD. Further investigation to elucidate the precise relationship of vitamin D to PD is essential.

30212740|t|The association between restless legs syndrome and premotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
30212740|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies regarding the association between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have produced contradictory results. However, the time frame between them has varied across these studies, and also, the longitudinal trajectroy of RLS symptoms has not been considered. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if transient or continuous/recurrent RLS identified by questionnaire are associated with the premotor symptoms of PD. METHODS: The study population comprised 16,636 men in the Health Professional Follow-Up Study, who answered questions regarding RLS symptoms in both 2002 and 2008, and were not diagnosed with PD. Outcomes were self-reported constipation, possible REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) in 2012 and smell identification test score in 2014. RESULTS: RLS was associated with increased odds of constipation, but only continuous/recurrent RLS status was associated with higher odds of having pRBD. RLS was not significantly associated with olfactory scores. CONCLUSION: In this large-scale longitudinal study, we found moderate associations between the presence of RLS and increased odds of having constipation and pRBD.

31863171|t|Olfactory dysfunction correlates with putaminal dopamine turnover in early de novo Parkinson's disease.
31863171|a|Although olfactory dysfunction is one of the most well-established prodromal symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), its correlation with clinical disease progression or dopaminergic dysfunction still remains unclear. We here evaluated the association of striatal dopamine metabolism and olfactory function in a homogenous cohort of 30 patients with early untreated de novo PD. Striatal dopamine metabolism was assessed by the extended 18Fluorodopa PET scanning protocol to measure 18Fluorodopa uptake (Kocc) and the effective dopamine distribution volume ratio (EDVR) as the inverse of dopamine turnover. Olfactory function was estimated by the "Sniffin' Sticks" test including odor threshold (T), discrimination (D) and identification (I) assessment. We detected moderate correlations of the EDVR in the posterior putamen with the TDI composite score (r = 0.412; p = 0.024; Pearson's correlation test) and the odor identification score (r = 0.444; p = 0.014). These correlations were confirmed by multivariate regression analyses using age, sex, symptom duration and disease severity as measured by UPDRSIII motor score as candidate covariates. No other associations were observed between olfaction measures and Kocc and EDVR in all striatal regions. Together, olfactory dysfunction in early PD is not correlated with striatal 18Fluorodopa uptake as a measure for dopaminergic degeneration, but with putaminal dopamine turnover as a marker for dopaminergic presynaptic compensatory processes in early PD. These results should be treated as hypothesis generating and require confirmation by larger multicenter studies.

32176656|t|Low Cost Screening for Features of Prodromal Parkinson's Disease in General Medical Practice in Italy.
32176656|a|The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of screening older adults attending general medical practice for features suggesting prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD). Four general practitioners recruited 392 subjects aged >=60 years, attending their primary clinics. A self-administered questionnaire collected information on history of probable rapid eye movements sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), constipation, risk markers for PD, and on subjective cognitive function. Olfactory function was tested. Constipation (27.8%), and hyposmia (19.9%), but not pRBD (4.3%), were more prevalent with age. Further supporting the feasibility of a longitudinal study, 299 subjects agreed to be followed.

32864870|t|Can dementia be predicted using olfactory identification test in the elderly? A Bayesian network analysis.
32864870|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that olfactory dysfunction is associated with cognitive decline or dementia. OBJECTIVE: To find a potential association between the olfactory identification (OI) and dementia onset, and build a prediction model for dementia screening in the older population. METHODS: Nine hundred and forty-seven participants from the Shanghai Aging Study were analyzed. The participants were dementia-free and completed OI test using the Sniffin' Sticks Screening Test-12 at baseline. After an average of 4.9-year follow-up, 75 (8%) of the participants were diagnosed with incident dementia. Discrete Bayesian network (DBN) and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were used to explore the dependencies of the incident dementia on the baseline demographics, lifestyles, and OI test results. RESULTS: In DBN analysis, odors of orange, cinnamon, peppermint, and pineapple, combined with age and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), achieved a high predictive ability for incident dementia, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) larger than 0.8. The odor cinnamon showed the highest AUC of 0.838 (95% CI: 0.731-0.946) and a high accuracy of 0.867. The DBN incorporating age, MMSE, and one odor test had an accuracy (0.760-0.872 vs. 0.835) comparable to that of the MLR model and revealed the dependency between the variables. CONCLUSION: The DBN using OI test may have predictive ability comparable to MLR analysis and suggest potential causal relationship for further investigation. Identification of odor cinnamon might be a useful indicator for dementia screening and deserve further investigation.

32925095|t|The Clinical Non-Motor Connectome in Early Parkinson's Disease.
32925095|a|BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of various anatomical origins are seen in early stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). OBJECTIVE: To analyse when and how NMS are linked together at this stage of the disease. METHODS: Prospective study recruiting 64 IPD patients with <=3 years of disease duration and 71 age-matched healthy controls (HC). NMS were clustered in 7 non-motor domains (NMD): general cognition, executive function, visuospatial function, autonomic function, olfaction, mood, and sleep. Correlation coefficients >= 0.3  were considered as significant. Bootstrapped correlation coefficients between the scores were generated in both groups. Fourteen IPD patients and 19 HC were available for a follow-up study two years later. RESULTS: The mean age of both groups was similar. 58% of IPD patients and 37% of HC were male (p = 0.01). At baseline IPD patients performed less well than HC on all NMD (p value between 0.0001 and 0.02). Out of 91 possible correlations between NMD, 21 were significant in IPD patients and 14 in HC at the level of >= 0.3 . The mean correlation level was higher in IPD patients than in HC, as evidenced by the higher box plot of correlation coefficients. Visuospatial scores at baseline were predictive of the motor deterioration at the follow-up exam. CONCLUSION: At early IPD stage various NMS are linked together, although not connected by anatomical networks. Such a clinical NMD connectome suggests almost synchronous disease initiation at different sites as also supported by fMRI findings. Alternatively, there may be compensation-driven interconnectivity of NMD.

33185454|t|Smelling the Dark Proteome: Functional Characterization of PITH Domain-Containing Protein 1 (C1orf128) in Olfactory Metabolism.
33185454|a|The Human Proteome Project (HPP) consortium aims to functionally characterize the dark proteome. On the basis of the relevance of olfaction in early neurodegeneration, we have analyzed the dark proteome using data mining in public resources and omics data sets derived from the human olfactory system. Multiple dark proteins localize at synaptic terminals and may be involved in amyloidopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have characterized the dark PITH domain-containing protein 1 (PITHD1) in olfactory metabolism using bioinformatics, proteomics, in vitro and in vivo studies, and neuropathology. PITHD1-/- mice exhibit olfactory bulb (OB) proteome changes related to synaptic transmission, cognition, and memory. OB PITHD1 expression increases with age in wild-type (WT) mice and decreases in Tg2576 AD mice at late stages. The analysis across 6 neurological disorders reveals that olfactory tract (OT) PITHD1 is specifically upregulated in human AD. Stimulation of olfactory neuroepithelial (ON) cells with PITHD1 alters the ON phosphoproteome, modifies the proliferation rate, and induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This workflow applied by the Spanish C-HPP and Human Brain Proteome Project (HBPP) teams across the ON-OB-OT axis can be adapted as a guidance to decipher functional features of dark proteins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD018784 and PXD021634.

33229546|t|Structure-function subsystem models of female and male forebrain networks integrating cognition, affect, behavior, and bodily functions.
33229546|a|The forebrain is the first of three primary vertebrate brain subdivisions. Macrolevel network analysis in a mammal (rat) revealed that the 466 gray matter regions composing the right and left sides of the forebrain are interconnected by 35,738 axonal connections forming a large set of overlapping, hierarchically arranged subsystems. This hierarchy is bilaterally symmetrical and sexually dimorphic, and it was used to create a structure-function conceptual model of intraforebrain network organization. Two mirror image top-level subsystems are presumably the most fundamental ontogenetically and phylogenetically. They essentially form the right and left forebrain halves and are relatively weakly interconnected. Each top-level subsystem in turn has two second-level subsystems. A ventromedial subsystem includes the medial forebrain bundle, functionally coordinating instinctive survival behaviors with appropriate physiological responses and affect. This subsystem has 26/24 (female/male) lowest-level subsystems, all using a combination of glutamate and GABA as neurotransmitters. In contrast, a dorsolateral subsystem includes the lateral forebrain bundle, functionally mediating voluntary behavior and cognition. This subsystem has 20 lowest-level subsystems, and all but 4 use glutamate exclusively for their macroconnections; no forebrain subsystems are exclusively GABAergic. Bottom-up subsystem analysis is a powerful engine for generating testable hypotheses about mechanistic explanations of brain function, behavior, and mind based on underlying circuit organization. Targeted computational (virtual) lesioning of specific regions of interest associated with Alzheimer's disease, clinical depression, and other disorders may begin to clarify how the effects spread through the entire forebrain network model.

33320870|t|Olfactory response as a marker for Alzheimer's disease: Evidence from perceptual and frontal lobe oscillation coherence deficit.
33320870|a|High-frequency oscillations of the frontal cortex are involved in functions of the brain that fuse processed data from different sensory modules or bind them with elements stored in the memory. These oscillations also provide inhibitory connections to neural circuits that perform lower-level processes. Deficit in the performance of these oscillations has been examined as a marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, such as the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques, do not occur in a spatially homogeneous fashion and progress more prominently in the medial temporal lobe in the early stages of the disease. This region of the brain contains neural circuitry involved in olfactory perception. Several studies have suggested that olfactory deficit can be used as a marker for early diagnosis of AD. A quantitative assessment of the performance of the olfactory system can hence serve as a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, offering a relatively convenient and inexpensive diagnosis method. This study examines the decline in the perception of olfactory stimuli and the deficit in the performance of high-frequency frontal oscillations in response to olfactory stimulation as markers for AD. Two measurement modalities are employed for assessing the olfactory performance: 1) An interactive smell identification test is used to sample the response to a sizable variety of odorants, and 2) Electroencephalography data are collected in an olfactory perception task with a pair of selected odorants in order to assess the connectivity of frontal cortex regions. Statistical analysis methods are used to assess the significance of selected features extracted from the recorded modalities as Alzheimer's biomarkers. Olfactory decline regressed to age in both healthy and mild AD groups are evaluated, and single- and multi-modal classifiers are also developed. The novel aspects of this study include: 1) Combining EEG response to olfactory stimulation with behavioral assessment of olfactory perception as a marker of AD, 2) Identification of odorants most significantly affected in mild AD patients, 3) Identification of odorants which are still adequately perceived by mild AD patients, 4) Analysis of the decline in the spatial coherence of different oscillatory bands in response to olfactory stimulation, and 5) Being the first study to quantitatively assess the performance of olfactory decline due to aging and AD in the Iranian population.

33415839|t|Olfactory impairment in Wilson's disease.
33415839|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early sign of many neurodegenerative disorders, but little is known about olfactory dysfunction in Wilson's disease (WD). We aimed to evaluate olfactory function in patients with WD and identify selective WD screening odors. METHODS: We measured olfactory identification ability in 25 patients with WD and 25 healthy controls using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Patients with WD were evaluated using the Global Assessment Scale for WD (GAS). Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: Patients with WD were worse at identifying smells in the simplified Chinese version of the UPSIT compared with healthy controls (t = 2.198, p = .033), but there was no difference in olfactory dysfunction severity between the groups (V = 136, p = .094). UPSIT scores negatively correlated with the GAS neurological scores in patients with WD (r = -0.571, p = .003). Using logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis, two models were screened. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that, to discriminate WD patients from healthy controls, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for a combination of seven odors (motor oil, onion, licorice, strawberry, tire, jasmine, and natural gas) was 0.926, while the AUC for three odors (onion, licorice, and jasmine) was 0.852. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WD may have stable, selective olfactory impairments. This selective pattern may be a useful tool for disease diagnosis and prediction.

33608800|t|Olfactory impairment in men and mice related to aging and amyloid-induced pathology.
33608800|a|Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is one of the most ancient senses in men and mice, important for a large variety of innate and acquired behaviors. Clinical data reveal an early impairment of olfaction during normal aging and in the course of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms remain obscure. In the current review, we compare different aspects of the aging- and Alzheimer's disease related impairment of olfaction in men and mice, aiming at the identification of common morbidities and biomarkers, which can be analyzed in detail in the appropriate mouse models. We also identify common, often interdependent (patho)physiological pathways, including but not limited to extracellular amyloid depositions, neuroinflammation, e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E, CNS insulin resistance, and the impairment of adult neurogenesis, to be targeted by basic and clinical research.

33653273|t|Protective effects of intracerebroventricular adiponectin against olfactory impairments in an amyloid beta1-42 rat model.
33653273|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment that eventually develops into dementia. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation is a widely described hallmark in AD, and has been reported to cause olfactory dysfunction, a condition considered an early marker of the disease associated with injuries in the olfactory bulb (OB), the hippocampus (HIPP) and other odor-related cortexes. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipokine with neuroprotective effects. Studies have demonstrated that APN administration decreases Abeta neurotoxicity and Tau hyperphosphorylation in the HIPP, reducing cognitive impairment. However, there are no studies regarding the neuroprotective effects of APN in the olfactory dysfunction observed in the Abeta rat model. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) administration of APN prevents the early olfactory dysfunction in an i.c.v Amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) rat model. Hence, we evaluated olfactory function by using a battery of olfactory tests aimed to assess olfactory memory, discrimination and detection in the Abeta rat model treated with APN. In addition, we determined the number of cells expressing the neuronal nuclei (NeuN), as well as the number of microglial cells by using the ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) marker in the OB and, CA1, CA3, hilus and dentate gyrus (DG) in the HIPP. Finally, we determined Arginase-1 expression in both nuclei through Western blot. RESULTS: We observed that the i.c.v injection of Abeta decreased olfactory function, which was prevented by the i.c.v administration of APN. In accordance with the olfactory impairment observed in i.c.v Abeta-treated rats, we observed a decrease in NeuN expressing cells in the glomerular layer of the OB, which was also prevented with the i.c.v APN. Furthermore, we observed an increase of Iba-1 cells in CA1, and DG in the HIPP of the Abeta rats, which was prevented by the APN treatment. CONCLUSION: The present study describes the olfactory impairment of Abeta treated rats and evidences the protective role that APN plays in the brain, by preventing the olfactory impairment induced by Abeta1-42. These results may lead to APN-based pharmacological therapies aimed to ameliorate AD neurotoxic effects.

34339626|t|Post-viral effects of COVID-19 in the olfactory system and their implications.
34339626|a|BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which any upper respiratory virus, including SARS-CoV-2, impairs chemosensory function are not known. COVID-19 is frequently associated with olfactory dysfunction after viral infection, which provides a research opportunity to evaluate the natural course of this neurological finding. Clinical trials and prospective and histological studies of new-onset post-viral olfactory dysfunction have been limited by small sample sizes and a paucity of advanced neuroimaging data and neuropathological samples. Although data from neuropathological specimens are now available, neuroimaging of the olfactory system during the acute phase of infection is still rare due to infection control concerns and critical illness and represents a substantial gap in knowledge. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: The active replication of SARS-CoV-2 within the brain parenchyma (ie, in neurons and glia) has not been proven. Nevertheless, post-viral olfactory dysfunction can be viewed as a focal neurological deficit in patients with COVID-19. Evidence is also sparse for a direct causal relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and abnormal brain findings at autopsy, and for trans-synaptic spread of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb. Taken together, clinical, radiological, histological, ultrastructural, and molecular data implicate inflammation, with or without infection, in either the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb, or both. This inflammation leads to persistent olfactory deficits in a subset of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Neuroimaging has revealed localised inflammation in intracranial olfactory structures. To date, histopathological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence does not suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is an obligate neuropathogen. WHERE NEXT?: The prevalence of CNS and olfactory bulb pathosis in patients with COVID-19 is not known. We postulate that, in people who have recovered from COVID-19, a chronic, recrudescent, or permanent olfactory deficit could be prognostic for an increased likelihood of neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders in the long term. An inflammatory stimulus from the nasal olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulbs and connected brain regions might accelerate pathological processes and symptomatic progression of neurodegenerative disease. Persistent olfactory impairment with or without perceptual distortions (ie, parosmias or phantosmias) after SARS-CoV-2 infection could, therefore, serve as a marker to identify people with an increased long-term risk of neurological disease.

35849713|t|The protocol for assessing olfactory working memory capacity in mice.
35849713|a|BACKGROUND: Working memory capacity (WMC) is the ability to maintain information over a few seconds. Although it has been extensively studied in healthy subjects and neuropsychiatric patients, few tasks have been developed to measure such changes in rodents. Many procedures have been used to measure WM in rodents, including the radial arm maze, the WM version of the Morris swimming task, and various delayed matching and nonmatching-to-sample tasks. It should be noted, however, that the memory components assessed in these procedures do not include memory capacity. METHODS: We developed an olfactory working memory capacity (OWMC) paradigm to assess the WMC of 3-month-old 5xFAD mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The task is divided into five phases: context adaptation, digging training, rule learning for nonmatching to a single sample odor (NMSS), rule learning for nonmatching to multiple sample odors (NMMS), and capacity testing. RESULTS: In the NMSS rule-learning phase, there was no difference between wild-type (WT) mice and 5xFAD mice in the performance correct rate, correct option rate, and correct rejection rate. The WT mice and 5xFAD mice showed similar memory capacity in the NMMS rule-learning phase. After capacity test, we found that the WMC was significantly diminished in 5xFAD mice. As the memory load increased, 5xFAD mice also made significantly more errors than WT mice. CONCLUSION: The OWMC task, based on a nonmatch-to-sample rule, is a sensitive and robust behavioral assay that we validated as a reliable method for measuring WMC and exploring different components of memory in mice.

36537628|t|[Olfactory disorders as a multidisciplinary problem].
36537628|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a serious symptom that requires careful differential diagnosis. The article presents convincing evidence that dysosmia is not only a symptom of rinological pathology, but also a manifestation of various neurodegenerative diseases. Some patients with SARS-CoV-2 have neurological symptoms. Modern studies show that olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are significant symptoms in the clinical presentation of the COVID-19 infection. The importance of olfactory diagnostics in relatives of patients with hereditary neurodegenerative diseases for the purpose of early detection of pathology is noted. We consider the possibility of introducing new methods for the diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction, which is a promising task both in the field of neurology and otorhinolaryngology, in order to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases at an early stage, improve the quality of life and social adaptation of patients.

37129797|t|Natural and Pathological Aging Distinctively Impacts the Pheromone Detection System and Social Behavior.
37129797|a|Normal aging and many age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease cause deficits in olfaction; however, it is currently unknown how natural and pathological aging impacts the detection of social odors which might contribute to the impoverishment of social behavior at old age further worsening overall health. Analysis of the vomeronasal organ, the main gateway to pheromone-encoded information, indicated that natural and pathological aging distinctively affects the neurogenic ability of the vomeronasal sensory epithelium. Whereas cell proliferation remained majorly preserved in 1-year-old APP/PS1 mice, naturally aged animals exhibited significant deficiencies in the number of mature, proliferative, and progenitor cells. These alterations may support age-related deficits in the recognition of social cues and the display of social behavior. Our findings indicate that aging disrupts the processing of social olfactory cues decreasing social odor exploration, discrimination, and habituation in both wild-type senescent (2-year-old) mice and in 1-year-old double mutant model of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1). Furthermore, social novelty was diminished in 1-year-old APP/PS1 mice, indicating that alterations in the processing of social cues are accelerated during pathological aging. This study reveals fundamental differences in the cellular processes by which natural and pathological aging disrupts the exploration of social information and social behavior.

38570429|t|Post-COVID-19 Hyposmia Does Not Exhibit Main Neurodegeneration Markers in the Olfactory Pathway.
38570429|a|The biological substrate of persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia is still unclear. However, as many neurodegenerative diseases present with smell impairment at onset, it may theoretically reflect degeneration within the central olfactory circuits. However, no data still exist regarding the post-COVID-19 patients. As the olfactory neurons (ONs) mirror pathological changes in the brain, allowing for tracking the underlying molecular events, here, we performed a broad analysis of ONs from patients with persistent post-COVID-19 OD to identify traces of potential neurodegeneration. ONs were collected through the non-invasive brushing of the olfactory mucosa from ten patients with persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia (lasting > 6 months after infection) and ten age/sex-matched controls. Immunofluorescence staining for protein quantification and RT-PCR for gene expression levels were combined to measure ONs markers of alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta, and tau pathology, axonal injury, and mitochondrial network. Patients and controls had similar ONs levels of oligomeric alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta peptide, tau protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), cytochrome C oxidase subunit 3 (COX3), and the heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). Our findings thus did not provide evidence for synucleinopathy and amyloid-beta mismetabolism or gross traces of neuronal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction within the olfactory system in the early phase of persistent post-COVID-19 hyposmia.

38609979|t|Nicotine restores olfactory function by activation of prok2R/Akt/FoxO3a axis in Parkinson's disease.
38609979|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction occurs frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we aimed to explore the potential biomarkers and underlying molecular pathways of nicotine for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. METHODS: MPTP was introduced into C57BL/6 male mice to generate a PD model. Regarding in vivo experiments, we performed behavioral tests to estimate the protective effects of nicotine in MPTP-induced PD mice. RNA sequencing and traditional molecular methods were used to identify molecules, pathways, and biological processes in the olfactory bulb of PD mouse models. Then, in vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate whether nicotine can activate the prok2R/Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway in both HEK293T cell lines and primary olfactory neurons treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Next, prok2R overexpression (prok2R+) and knockdown (prok2R-) were introduced with lentivirus, and the Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway was further explored. Finally, the damaging effects of MPP+ were evaluated in prok2R overexpression (prok2R+) HEK293T cell lines. RESULTS: Nicotine intervention significantly alleviated olfactory and motor dysfunctions in mice with PD. The prok2R/Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway was activated after nicotine treatment. Consequently, apoptosis of olfactory sensory neurons was significantly reduced. Furthermore, prok2R+ and prok2R- HEK293T cell lines exhibited upregulation and downregulation of the Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway, respectively. Additionally, prok2R+ HEK293T cells were resistant to MPP+-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of nicotine in improving hyposmia in PD mice. These improvements were correlated with reduced apoptosis of olfactory sensory neurons via activated prok2R/Akt/FoxO3a axis. These results explained the potential protective functions of nicotine in PD patients.

38663633|t|RNA sequencing of olfactory bulb in Parkinson's disease reveals gene alterations associated with olfactory dysfunction.
38663633|a|The olfactory bulb is involved early in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is consistent with the early onset of olfactory dysfunction. Identifying the molecular mechanisms through which PD affects the olfactory bulb could lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD. We specifically aimed to assess gene expression changes, affected pathways and co-expression network by whole transcriptomic profiling of the olfactory bulb in subjects with clinicopathologically defined PD. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on frozen human olfactory bulbs of 20 PD and 20 controls without dementia or any other neurodegenerative disorder, from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative disorders and the Brain and Body Donation Program. Differential expression analysis (19 PD vs 19 controls) revealed 2164 significantly differentially expressed genes (1090 upregulated and 1074 downregulated) in PD. Pathways enriched in downregulated genes included oxidative phosphorylation, olfactory transduction, metabolic pathways, and neurotransmitters synapses while immune and inflammatory responses as well as cellular death related pathways were enriched within upregulated genes. An overrepresentation of microglial and astrocyte-related genes was observed amongst upregulated genes, and excitatory neuron-related genes were overrepresented amongst downregulated genes. Co-expression network analysis revealed significant modules highly correlated with PD and olfactory dysfunction that were found to be involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cholinergic synapse, and metabolic pathways. LAIR1 (leukocyte associated immunoglobulin like receptor 1) and PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) were identified as hub genes with a high discriminative power between PD and controls reinforcing an important role of neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb of PD subjects. Olfactory identification test score positively correlated with expression of genes coding for G-coupled protein, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic receptor proteins and negatively correlated with genes for proteins expressed in glial olfactory ensheathing cells. In conclusion, this study reveals gene alterations associated with neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and disruptions of factors involved in the initiation of olfactory transduction signaling that may be involved in PD-related olfactory dysfunction.

39113792|t|Rbm24/Notch1 signaling regulates adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and mediates Parkinson-associated olfactory dysfunction.
39113792|a|Rationale: Adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) is essential for maintaining neural homeostasis, and its dysregulation contributes to anosmia and delayed tissue healing in neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite intricate regulatory networks identified in SVZ neurogenesis, the molecular mechanisms dynamically maintaining neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in response to physiological and pathological stimuli remain incompletely elucidated. Methods: We generated an RNA binding motif protein 24 (Rbm24) knockout model to investigate its impact on adult neurogenesis in the SVZ, employing immunofluorescence, immunoblot, electrophysiology, RNA-sequencing, and in vitro experiments. Further investigations utilized a PD mouse model, along with genetic and pharmacological manipulations, to elucidate Rbm24 involvement in PD pathology. Results: Rbm24, a multifaceted post-transcriptional regulator of cellular homeostasis, exhibited broad expression in the SVZ from development to aging. Deletion of Rbm24 significantly impaired NSPC proliferation in the adult SVZ, ultimately resulting in collapsed neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb. Notably, Rbm24 played a specific role in maintaining Notch1 mRNA stability in adult NSPCs. The Rbm24/Notch1 signaling axis was significantly downregulated in the SVZ of PD mice. Remarkably, overexpression of Rbm24 rescued disruption of adult neurogenesis and olfactory dysfunction in PD mice, and these effects were hindered by DAPT, a potent inhibitor of Notch1. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of the Rbm24/Notch1 signaling axis in regulating adult SVZ neurogenesis under physiological and pathological circumstances. This provides valuable insights into the dynamic regulation of NSPC homeostasis and offers a potential targeted intervention for PD and related neurological disorders.

39251058|t|Intracerebroventricular injection of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils do not induce motor and olfactory impairment in C57BL/6 mice.
39251058|a|INTRODUCTION: Alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total alphaSyn were significantly lower in PD patients, whereas the aggregates were higher, and this phenomenon was further exacerbated with longer disease duration. However, whether CSF alphaSyn can be the cause and/or a consequence in PD is not fully elucidated. METHOD: We administered 2 ng or 200 ng alphaSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs) by intracerebroventricular injection for consecutive 7 days in C57BL/6 mice. The olfactory function was assessed by the olfactory discrimination test and buried food-seeking test. The locomotor function was assessed by the rotarod test, pole test, open field test and CatWalk gait analysis. Phosphorylated alphaSyn at serine 129 was detected by the immunohistochemistry staining. Iron levels was determined by Perl's-DAB iron staining and synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence. RESULTS: The mice did not exhibit any diffuse synucleinopathy in the brain for up to 30 weeks, although alphaSyn PFFs induced aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells and in the substantia nigra and striatum of mice with stereotactic injection. No impairment of motor behaviors or olfactory functions were observed, although there was a temporary motor enhancement at 1 week. We then demonstrated iron levels were comparable in certain brain regions, suggesting there was no iron deposition/redistribution occurred. CONCLUSION: The intraventricular injection of alphaSyn PFFs does not induce synucleinopathy or behavioral symptoms. These findings have implications that CSF alphaSyn aggregates may not necessarily contribute to the onset or progression in PD.

884490|t|Clinical testing of olfaction reassessed.
884490|a|Odours in current use for testing olfaction (e.g., peppermint, camphor) cause considerable trigeminal nerve stimulation; this would render them relatively inefficacious in the detection of lesions of the main olfactory pathway. Musks and floral odours are considered to be relatively 'pure' olfactory stimulants, acting virtually exclusively via the first cranial nerve. These odours have been compared with standard odours in a group of patients whose olfactory pathways had been damaged by frontal tumours, surgical operation, head injury, multiple sclerosis and miscellaneous causes. Hyposmia or anosmia was detected more frequently and more reliably by musks and floral odours in all groups of patients; a number of patients had gross deficits of odour description without hyposmia or anosmia. Two-thirds of an unselected group of patients with multiple sclerosis had olfactory abnormalities. A substantial improvement in the rate of detection of organic lesions affecting the olfactory pathway can be achieved by substituting odours such as musk ketone, exaltolide, linalyl acetate and coumarin for those in current use.

3399075|t|Olfactory dysfunction in parkinsonism: a general deficit unrelated to neurologic signs, disease stage, or disease duration.
3399075|a|To explore the nature of the olfactory dysfunction associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), 81 PD patients who scored well on a cognitive screening test were administered the 40-odorant University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test; 38 were additionally given a forced-choice phenylethyl alcohol odor detection threshold test. Clinical ratings of 11 neurologic symptoms (three bilateral) were obtained at the time of testing, and odor identification was retested in 24 patients at intervals ranging from 5 to 39 months. Relative to matched controls, the PD patients exhibited consistent and marked decrements on both types of olfactory tests (ps less than 0.0001). The odor identification deficit was not restricted to any subset of odorants and did not evidence longitudinal change. A factor analysis of the intercorrelations among the variables yielded six easily interpretable factors: general motor, oral motor, olfactory function, cognitive function, tremor, and gender. Olfactory test scores were independent of all other measures, including disease stage and duration. Seventy-two percent of the PD patients were unaware of a smell disorder before testing; those who were aware had significantly lower test scores. A statistical comparison of PD patients' olfactory test scores to those obtained from Alzheimer's disease patients found the olfactory disorders of these diseases to be indistinguishable. The data support the hypothesis that the olfactory deficit of PD is a general and stable one which likely occurs early in the disease process.

3819760|t|Olfactory threshold in Parkinson's disease.
3819760|a|Olfactory threshold to differing concentrations of amyl acetate was determined in 78 subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 40 age-matched controls. Impaired olfactory threshold (previously reported by others) was confirmed in Parkinsonian subjects compared with controls. There was no significant correlation between olfactory threshold and age, sex, duration of disease, or current therapy with levodopa or anticholinergic drugs. In a sub-group of 14 levodopa-treated patients with severe "on-off" fluctuations, no change in olfactory threshold between the two states was demonstrable. Olfactory impairment in Parkinson's disease may involve mechanisms that are not influenced by pharmacologic manipulation of dopaminergic or cholinergic status.

8185881|t|The olfactory bulb in Alzheimer disease: a morphologic study of neuron loss, tangles, and senile plaques in relation to olfaction.
8185881|a|Complete pairs of olfactory bulbs of six Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and of six age- and sex-matched controls were morphologically investigated using a random systematic sampling procedure. The total number of cells and the number of mitral cells were the same for controls and patients, but the volume of the bulb and the number of neurons in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) were decreased in AD patients. The loss of AON neurons was limited to the younger AD patients and was very severe (75%). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques (SP) were found in controls, but they were more frequent in AD, especially in the younger cases. A new finding was the occurrence of very large numbers of so-called diffuse or "very primitive plaques" with the methenamine-silver stain (MS-SP). NFT and SP were limited to the AON but MS-SP also occurred in other parts of the bulb. The data are discussed in relation to olfaction, and it was concluded that odor identification is processed in central rather than in peripheral olfactory structures.

8778881|t|Odor sensitivity is impaired in HIV-positive cognitively impaired patients.
8778881|a|An estimated 7-28% of patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop dementia and at least 50% develop mild neurocognitive impairment. Past studies have shown odor identification impairments in HIV + neurocognitively impaired patients. It is difficult, however, based on an odor identification test to state with certainty that individuals with cognitive impairment have sensory olfactory deficits, because odor identification tests are known to draw upon cognitive skills. In the present study odor detection sensitivity was evaluated using an ascending, forced-choice, two-alternative, odor threshold test for butanol. Subjects were divided into three groups, HIV seropositive (HIV+) neurocognitively impaired, HIV+ neurocognitively unimpaired, and HIV negative, based on neurological and psychological testing. An analysis of variance revealed significantly poorer odor sensitivity for the HIV+ neurocognitively impaired group than for the two control groups. A significant negative correlation between degree of cognitive impairment and olfactory sensitivity was also found. We suspect that the olfactory deficits found in the HIV+ neurocognitively impaired subjects are primarily due to damage to the central nervous system; however, nasal infection may be a contributing etiology.

10785834|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
10785834|a|The olfactory system is one of the nonmotor systems severely affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). Olfactory dysfunction occurs early in the disease process, is independent of disease stage, duration, and treatment. However, olfactory dysfunction appears to be dependent on disease subtype. Olfaction is mildly impaired or preserved in most of the parkinsonism-plus syndromes (PPS). This provides a means of differential diagnosis between typical PD and PPS. Olfactory function is impaired also in familial forms of parkinsonism in which the genetic defect is known. In familial parkinsonism, olfactory function is impaired in both typical PD and PPS phenotypes. Olfactory dysfunction does not appear to be a manifestation of dopamine deficiency. Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), as well as with normal aging. The neuropathological changes observed in the olfactory system in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases appear to be disease-specific, raising the possibility that olfactory dysfunction may be the result of a central rather than a peripheral process. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases remain unknown.

15548552|t|Combination of 'idiopathic' REM sleep behaviour disorder and olfactory dysfunction as possible indicator for alpha-synucleinopathy demonstrated by dopamine transporter FP-CIT-SPECT.
15548552|a|REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and olfactory dysfunction are common and very early features of alpha-synucleinopathies, in particular Parkinson's disease. To investigate the hypothesis that these two clinical features in combination are an indicator of evolving alpha-synucleinopathy, olfactory function was assessed in RBD. We studied 30 patients (18 male, 12 female; mean age 48 +/- 14 years, range 19-78 years) with clinical (idiopathic, n = 6; symptomatic, n = 13, mostly associated with narcolepsy) or subclinical (n = 11, associated with narcolepsy) RBD according to standard criteria and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects using standardized 'Sniffin' Sticks'. RBD patients had a significantly higher olfactory threshold (P = 0.0001), lower discrimination score (P = 0.003), and lower identification score (P = 0.001). Compared with normative data, 97% of the RBD patients had a pathologically increased olfactory threshold, 63% an impaired odour discrimination score, and 63% a decreased identification score. On neurological examination, signs of parkinsonism were newly found in five patients with clinical RBD (not associated with narcolepsy), who usually had a long history of 'idiopathic' RBD. Four of the five patients fulfilled the UK Brain Bank criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The underlying nigrostriatal degeneration of clinical Parkinson's disease was confirmed by I-123-FP-CIT SPECT in one patient and early nigrostriatal degeneration was identified by SPECT in a further two patients with 'idiopathic' clinical RBD out of 11 RBD patients who agreed to undergo SPECT studies. Our study shows that RBD patients have a profound impairment of olfactory function. Five patients with clinical RBD not associated with narcolepsy had clinical or imaging signs of nigrostriatal degeneration. This new clinical finding correlates with the neuropathological staging of Parkinson's disease (stages 1-3) as proposed by Braak. In stage 1, the anterior olfactory nucleus or the olfactory bulb is affected (along with the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves). In stage 2, additional lesions consistently remain confined to the medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum, which are critical areas for RBD. Midbrain lesions are found only in stage 3, in particular degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Thus, 'idiopathic' RBD patients with olfactory impairment might present with stage 2 preclinical alpha-synucleinopathy. Since narcoleptic patients are not known to have an increased risk of developing parkinsonism, the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of hyposmia in RBD/narcolepsy patients requires further research.

15592726|t|Orofacial apraxia in corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease.
15592726|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the assessment of orofacial praxis is useful for the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes and to understand the neural mechanisms underlying OFA, searching for the respective roles of cortical and subcortical structures. METHODS: Forty-four patients were assessed: 12 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), 8 with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 12 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 12 with corticobasal degeneration (CBD). An easy bedside scale was used, exploring single gestures, gestures with noise production and multiple sequential gestures. We searched for group and task effects. RESULTS: Patients with CBD were significantly more impaired than those with IPD, MSA or PSP (p<0.001). Our assessment was unable to distinguish between the IPD, MSA and PSP groups. There was a clear task effect in CBD with a major impairment in multiple sequential gestures (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Assessment of orofacial praxis helps in the clinical diagnosis of CBD. Patients with IPD, MSA and PSP did not present with OFA. We suggest that the deficit in multiple sequential gestures in CBD is related to simultaneous lesions of the parietal lobule and the supplementary motor area.

15597336|t|Olfaction testing in patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease: is this a distinct condition?
15597336|a|There is considerable controversy regarding the relationship between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD), especially when tremor is the dominant feature of PD or there is a family history of tremor. Reduced olfaction function is one of the initial signs of PD. In contrast, ET has relatively preserved olfaction. To infer whether the tremor-dominant subgroup of PD is intrinsically different from mainstream PD, we tested olfaction using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test-40 (UPSIT) in this group and compared the findings with those of patients with non-tremor-dominant "regular" PD. We then evaluated predictors of reduced UPSIT scores within the tremor-dominant group. Overall, olfaction did not differ between tremor-dominant PD and regular PD; however, the subgroup of tremor-dominant PD with a family history of tremor had less olfaction loss than those without a family history (P = 0.0007) or those with regular PD (P = 0.0350). Other clinical features of this tremor-dominant PD with a family history of tremor group mostly resembled those without a family history. This finding suggests that patients with a family history of tremor may represent a different disease process even though, aside from differences in olfaction, they are clinically similar to other patients with tremor-dominant parkinsonism. It additionally suggests phenotypic overlap between PD and ET.

17508142|t|Selective hyposmia and nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation in Parkinson's disease.
17508142|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent and early feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), often preceding the motor symptoms by several years. Assessment of olfactory deficits may be used in the diagnostic assessment of PD. In this study we investigated the relationship between selective deficits in smell identification and nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation in patients with PD. Twenty-seven PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III) and 27 healthy controls matched for gender and age underwent olfactory testing using the 40-odor University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). PD patients underwent (11)C-beta-CFT dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and clinical motor examination. We found that total UPSIT scores were significantly lower in the PD than in the control subjects (z=4.7, p<0.0001). Analysis of the individual smell scores identified 3 odors with an accuracy of >0.75 for the diagnosis of PD. These odors were banana, licorice, and dill pickle. A PD-specific smell identification score (UPSIT-3) was calculated for these 3 odors. Analysis of the patient PET data demonstrated significant correlations between dorsal striatal DAT activity and the UPSIT-3 (R(S)=0.53, p=0.0027) and total UPSIT (R(S)=0.44, p=0.023) scores. UPSIT-3 (R(S)=0.43, p=0.027) but not total UPSIT (R(S)=0.20, ns) correlated with nigral DAT activity. We conclude that patients with PD have selective hyposmia. A simplified UPSIT smell identification test consisting of 3 PD-selective odors had more robust correlation with nigral and dorsal striatial dopaminergic activity compared with the full UPSIT scores in patients with PD. Assessment of selective olfactory deficits may be used as a simplified olfactory screening test in the evaluation of subjects with possible PD.

17519323|t|Functional imaging of the cerebral olfactory system in patients with Parkinson's disease.
17519323|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is considered to be an early manifestation of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To establish the cortical basis of olfactory function in patients with PD. METHOD: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate brain activity related to olfactory processing in patients with hyposmic PD at mild to moderate stages of the disease (n = 12, median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.0) and in healthy, age-matched controls (n = 16) while passively perceiving a positively valenced (rose-like) odorant. RESULTS: In both patients with PD and healthy controls, olfactory stimulation activated brain regions relevant for olfactory processing (ie the amygdaloid complex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain and the hippocampal formation). In controls, a bilateral activation of the amygdala and hippocampus was observed, whereas patients with PD involved these structures in the left hemisphere only. Group comparison showed that regions of higher activation in patients with PD were located bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45) and anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24/32), and the left dorsal and right ventral striatum. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PD, results obtained under the specific conditions used suggest that neuronal activity in the amygdala and hippocampus is reduced. Assuming an impact on olfactory-related regions early in PD, our findings support the idea that selective impairment of these brain regions contributes to olfactory dysfunction. Furthermore, neuronal activity in components of the dopaminergic, cortico-striatal loops appears to be upregulated, indicating that compensatory processes are involved. This mechanism has not yet been demonstrated during olfactory processing in PD.

17994582|t|Nonmotor symptoms as presenting complaints in Parkinson's disease: a clinicopathological study.
17994582|a|Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity in later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prodromal NMS are also a well recognized component of the clinical picture in some patients but the prevalence of NMS as presenting complaints, and their impact on clinical management, in pathologically-proven cases of PD is unknown. The presenting complaints of 433 cases of pathologically-proven PD archived at the Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Diseases were identified from the clinical case notes. 91/433 (21%) of patients with PD presented with NMS of which the most frequent were pain (15%), urinary dysfunction (3.9%), anxiety, or depression (2.5%). Presenting with NMS is associated with a delayed diagnosis of PD (Mann-Whitney U, P = 0.001). These patients were more likely to be misdiagnosed initially and were more likely to have been referred to orthopedic surgeons or rheumatologists than neurologists (nonmotor group 5.5% vs. motor group 44.2%, chi(2) P < 0.0001). NMS are commonly seen as presenting complaints in pathologically confirmed PD, and initial misdiagnosis may be associated with potentially inappropriate medical interventions. Presenting with NMS does not affect the motor response to medication, but is associated with shorter disease duration (chi(2) P = 0.016).

18242780|t|Progressive impairment in olfactory working memory in a mouse model of Mild Cognitive Impairment.
18242780|a|Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), exhibiting both working memory and olfactory deficits are likely to progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeting this pre-clinical AD population with disease modifying agents or cognitive enhancers represents the best strategy for halting or delaying the impact of this pernicious disease. However, there is a paucity of animal models of MCI with which to assess putative therapeutic strategies. We describe an odour span task which assesses the ability of mice to remember lists of odours, and report subtle cognitive deficits in human amyloid over-expressing (Tg2576) mice, at an age prior to plaque deposition. Four-month-old Tg2576 mice exhibited normal acquisition and performance in the standard 12-span task, but were significantly impaired when memory load was increased to 22 odours. By 8-months, a performance deficit was apparent in the 12-span task and by 1-year mice also exhibited significant acquisition deficits. Thus, by assessing olfactory working memory in Tg2576 mice we can model aspects of MCI in rodents and aid development of future therapeutic strategies for AD.

18581481|t|Gender-related changes in increase of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb of Parkinson's disease patients.
18581481|a|Gender differences in dopaminergic related neurodegenerative diseases have hardly been studied until now. It is generally accepted that more men than women suffer from Parkinson's disease. One of the most prevalent symptoms in Parkinson's patients, hyposmia, does not show gender differences, while normally the sense of smell is better developed in females. Whether the change in dopamine in the olfactory bulb contributes equally to hyposmia in male and female Parkinson's patients is the subject of the present study. In a stereological study the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the olfactory bulbs of male and female Parkinson's patients and age-matched controls has been estimated. The present stereological study shows that the number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells in control females is significantly lower than those in control males. The number of dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulbs of both male and female Parkinson's patients equals that of healthy males of the same age group. We therefore conclude that the hyposmia in Parkinson's disease patients cannot simply be ascribed to dopamine in the olfactory bulb.

18759360|t|A comparative study of odor identification and odor discrimination deficits in Parkinson's disease.
18759360|a|The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of odor discrimination and odor identification deficits in a large population of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to determine which of these olfactory tests best distinguishes between patients with PD and control subjects. Olfactory performance was assessed in 404 patients with PD and 150 controls, using the odor identification and discrimination parts of the Sniffin' Sticks battery. Mean identification and discrimination scores in patients with PD were significantly lower than in controls. Linear regression analysis using a 95% confidence interval revealed that, relative to the performance of controls, 65.0% of patients with PD had an impairment in odor identification, whereas 42.1% of patients were impaired on the odor discrimination task. ROC curves revealed a higher sensitivity and specificity for odor identification than for odor discrimination in separating patients from controls. In patients with PD, odor discrimination performance decreased with increasing disease duration, whereas odor identification was not correlated with disease stage or duration. In PD, odor identification is more frequently impaired than odor discrimination and allows a better discrimination between patients and controls. Although an odor identification deficit is generally believed to be independent of disease progression, the impairment in odor discrimination appears to increase with disease duration.

19139305|t|Olfactory function in corticobasal syndrome and frontotemporal dementia.
19139305|a|BACKGROUND: Formal olfactory testing may be useful as a bedside tool to help differentiate between conditions such as atypical parkinsonism, dementia, and psychiatric conditions. However, the neural basis of olfactory dysfunction, the effect of concurrent cognitive deficits on olfactory testing results, and the exact prevalence of olfactory deficits in populations with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and the frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD-FV) are to date unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and the neural basis of olfactory recognition deficits in patients with a clinical diagnosis of CBS or FTD-FV. DESIGN: Retrospective study of clinical, neuropsychological, and imaging data. SETTING: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five patients with CBS, 22 with FTD-FV, and 12 age-matched control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of neuropsychological evaluation, formal olfactory recognition testing (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT]), and voxel-based morphometry analysis of structural magnetic resonance images of the brain. RESULTS: Mean UPSIT percentile scores were 31.6% for the CBS group and 9.5% for the FTD-FV group. The voxel-based morphometry correlations between local gray matter and UPSIT scores showed a significant volume effect in the right midfrontal gyrus for the FTD-FV patients and in the right insula, right midfrontal gyrus, and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus for the patients with CBS. A linear regression analysis of the UPSIT scores revealed as significant predictors the general memory score of the Wechsler Memory Scale and the Boston Naming Test total score for the patients with FTD-FV and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale total score for the patients with CBS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a more severe olfactory impairment for CBS patients than previously reported. We also showed a significant relationship between formal olfactory recognition testing scores and specific cognitive domains. These findings could be useful to clinically differentiate FTD-FV and CBS from other dementing illnesses and movement disorders.

19205070|t|Biopsies of olfactory epithelium in patients with Parkinson's disease.
19205070|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving several neuronal systems. Impaired olfactory function may constitute one of the earliest symptoms of PD. However, it is still unclear to what degree changes of the olfactory epithelium may contribute to dysosmia and if these changes are different from those of other hyposmic or anosmic patients. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that olfactory loss in PD is a consequence of specific PD-related damage of olfactory epithelium. Biopsies of 7 patients diagnosed with PD were taken. Six patients with PD were hyposmic, one anosmic. As non-PD controls served 9 patients with hyposmia, 9 with anosmia, and 7 normosmic individuals. Further, nasal mucosa of 4 postmortem individuals was investigated. Immunohistochemical examinations were performed with antibodies against olfactory marker protein (OMP), protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), beta-tubulin, (BT), proliferation-associated antigen (Ki 67), the stem cell marker nestin, cytokeratin, p75NGFr, and alpha-synuclein. Most of the biopsy specimens exhibited irregular areas of olfactory-like, dysplastic epithelium positive for either PGP 9.5 or BT, but negative for OMP. No major histochemical differences in either the expression or distribution of these proteins were observed in the olfactory epithelium of patients with PD compared with controls. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) data indicated mRNA for OMP in almost all subjects, independently of their olfactory performance. These data support the idea that olfactory loss in Parkinson's disease is not a consequence of damage to the olfactory epithelium but rather results from distinct central-nervous abnormalities.

19214935|t|The olfactory system and its disorders.
19214935|a|The sense of smell is greatly underappreciated, despite the fact that it monitors the intake of airborne agents into the human respiratory system and determines to a large degree the flavor and palatability of foods and beverages. In addition to enhancing quality of life, this primary sensory system warns of spoiled foods, leaking natural gas, polluted air and smoke, and mediates basic elements of communication (e.g., mother-infant interactions). It is now apparent that smell dysfunction is among the first clinical signs of such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Parkinson's disease. In this brief article, the author reviews the anatomy and physiology of this primary sensory system, means of assessing its function, and major diseases and disorders with which it is intimately associated.

19341225|t|[Correlation between olfactory dysfunction and various clinical parameters in patients with multiple sclerosis].
19341225|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by myelin destruction and axon loss. Among various clinical manifestations of MS cognitive disorders are frequent. Olfactory disorders are also noticed but they are rarely considered in clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to examine frequency of olfactory dysfunction in patients with MS and its relationship to clinical parameters. METHODS: Our study comprised 61 consecutive patients with definite MS who were hospitalized at the Department for Multiple Sclerosis and Other Immune-Mediated Disorders of CNS, Institute of Neurology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, Belgrade, and 45 gender-, age- and education-matched healthy voluntaries. The Pocket Smell Test (PST) was used for examination of olfactory function. Cognitive functions were analysed using the tests from the Brief Battery of Neuropsychological Tests: Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test 3-minute Version (PASAT 3"), Word List Generation (WLG) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction was found in 26 (43%) MS patients and 5 (11%) controls (p = 0.001). Statistically significant positive correlation was found only between PST score and WLG scores (r = 0.297, p = 0.030). In comparison with the previously published normative values, our subjects with MS had decrease in the mean indices of the PASAT 3" in 28%, SDMT in 51% and WLG in 90% of the subjects. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction is frequent in our population of patients with MS. This disturbance correlates with the impairment of cognitive functions in these patients.

19514014|t|The PRIAMO study: A multicenter assessment of nonmotor symptoms and their impact on quality of life in Parkinson's disease.
19514014|a|We performed a multicenter survey using a semistructured interview in 1,072 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) enrolled during 12 months in 55 Italian centers to assess the prevalence of nonmotor symptoms (NMSs), their association with cognitive impairment, and the impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). We found that 98.6% of patients with PD reported the presence of NMSs. The most common were as follows: fatigue (58%), anxiety (56%), leg pain (38%), insomnia (37%), urgency and nocturia (35%), drooling of saliva and difficulties in maintaining concentration (31%). The mean number of NMS per patient was 7.8 (range, 0-32). NMS in the psychiatric domain were the most frequent (67%). Frequency of NMS increased along with the disease duration and severity. Patients with cognitive impairment reported more frequently apathy, attention/memory deficit, and psychiatric symptoms. Apathy was the symptom associated with worse PDQ-39 score but also presence of fatigue, attention/memory, and psychiatric symptoms had a negative impact on QoL. These findings further support a key role for NMS in the clinical frame of PD and the need to address them specifically in clinical trials using dedicated scales.

19686202|t|Parkinson's disease: the dual hit theory revisited.
19686202|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) has a long prodromal period during which several nonmotor features develop; in particular, impairment of olfaction, vagal dysfunction, and sleep disorder. Early sites of Lewy pathology are the olfactory bulb and enteric plexuses of the foregut. We propose that a neurotropic pathogen, probably viral, enters the brain via two routes: (a) nasal, with anterograde progression into the temporal lobe; and (b) gastric, secondary to swallowing of nasal secretions in saliva. These secretions might contain a neurotropic pathogen that, after penetration of the epithelial lining, could enter axons of the Meissner's plexus and via transsynaptic transmission reach the preganglionic parasympathetic motor neurons of the vagus nerve. This would allow retrograde transport into the medulla and from here into the pons and midbrain until the substantia nigra is reached and typical aspects of disease commence. Evidence for this theory from the perspective of olfactory and autonomic dysfunction is reviewed and the possible routes of pathogenic invasion are considered. It is concluded that the most parsimonious explanation for the initial events of sPD is pathogenic access to the brain through the foregut and nose-hence the term "dual hit."

20133956|t|Prevalence and neurodegenerative or other associations with olfactory impairment in an older community.
20133956|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of olfactory impairment and its associations with neurodegenerative and other conditions in older adults. METHOD: 1,636 participants (>/=60 years) enrolled in the Blue Mountains Eye Study (2002-2004) were analyzed. Olfaction was assessed by the San Diego Odor Identification Test and used to classify mild impairment (4 or 5), moderate impairment (</=3), or any impairment (<6). RESULTS: Prevalent olfactory impairment was 27.0%. After multivariate adjustment, the likelihood increased twofold with each decade of life after 60 years and was higher in men than women. Olfactory impairment and body mass index (BMI) were inversely associated. Persons with Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment had an increased likelihood of mild and moderate olfactory impairment. DISCUSSION: Over one in four older persons had olfactory impairment. The prevalence was higher in men, increased with age and decreasing BMI, and was higher among persons with Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment.

20374072|t|Is rhinorrhea an under-recognized intrinsic symptom of Parkinson disease? A prospective pilot study.
20374072|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence of idiopathic rhinorrhea in PD patients versus controls, to determine the correlation between rhinorrhea and anosmia, and the factors associated with rhinorrhea. SCOPE: A cohort of 61 PD patients and 51 age-matched controls completed a survey about rhinorrhea and underwent the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We compared the prevalence of idiopathic rhinorrhea in the PD patients versus controls, the correlation between rhinorrhea and anosmia in PD patients, and the factors associated with rhinorrhea in the PD patients. The results of the study are that 6% of controls versus 24% of PD patients had rhinorrhea (p = .03); moreover, only 2% of controls versus 15% of PD patients had severe rhinorrhea. CONCLUSION: Rhinorrhea is more prevalent in PD patients compared to controls and it does not significantly impact performance on a smell test.

21372115|t|Olfactory threshold is impaired in early, active multiple sclerosis.
21372115|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction has been reported in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, to date no data are available on different qualities of olfactory function, namely odour identification, odour discrimination and odour perception threshold. OBJECTIVE: To assess different qualities of olfactory function in patients with MS and correlate these with demographic data, clinical data, depression, quality of life and cognitive functions. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 50 patients with MS or clinically isolated syndrome and 30 healthy controls were included. Olfactory function was measured using the Sniffin' Sticks test. RESULTS: The scores for odour identification (p = 0.001), odour perception threshold (p = 0.037) and the combined score of odour identification, discrimination and perception threshold (TDI, p = 0.002) were significantly lower in MS. Hyposmia for identification (p = 0.0017), threshold (p = 0.017) and TDI score (p = 0.0014) was more frequent in MS. Olfactory threshold was impaired in patients who were clinically active in the previous year (p = 0.026) and in patients with a disease duration less than 2 years (p = 0.0093). Identification score was negatively correlated with disease duration (p = 0.0017). Olfactory function was not associated with disability, depression or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: We report evidence for qualitatively distinct hyposmia in MS, with increased smell threshold in the early inflammatory phases of the disease and impaired identification with a more widespread chronic disease.

22167416|t|Characterization of oral disintegrating film containing donepezil for Alzheimer disease.
22167416|a|The aim of this study was to develop a taste-masked oral disintegrating film (ODF) containing donepezil, with fast disintegration time and suitable mechanical strength, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, corn starch, polyethylene glycol, lactose monohydrate and crosspovidone served as the hydrophilic polymeric bases of the ODF. The uniformity, in vitro disintegration time, drug release and the folding endurance of the ODF were examined. The in vitro results showed that 80% of donepezil hydrochloride was released within 5 minutes with mean disintegration time of 44 seconds. The result of the film flexibility test showed that the number of folding time to crack the film was 40 times, an indication of sufficient mechanical property for patient use. A single-dose, fasting, four-period, eight-treatment, double-blind study involving 16 healthy adult volunteers was performed to evaluate the in situ disintegration time and palatability of ODF. Five parameters, namely taste, aftertaste, mouthfeel, ease of handling and acceptance were evaluated. The mean in situ disintegration time of ODF was 49 seconds. ODF containing 7 mg of sucralose were more superior than saccharin and aspartame in terms of taste, aftertaste, mouthfeel and acceptance. Furthermore, the ODF was stable for at least 6 months when stored at 40 C and 75% relative humidity.

22229594|t|A review of the oro-dento-facial characteristics of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III (familial dysautonomia).
22229594|a|The oro-dento-facial features and dysfunction of children with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III, known as familial dysautonomia or Riley-Day syndrome, was first described in the scientific literature in 1949. They include dental trauma; dental and soft tissue self-mutilation; normal dental age; normal sequence and timing of eruption and exfoliation of teeth; smaller tooth size; different and disproportional tooth components; normal alveolar bone height; small jaws, mild crowding, and malocclusions. These persons have craniofacial morphology that is different from accepted norms but they resemble norms of their ethnic origin. The subjects can have gray, pale, shiny faces with an asymmetric suffering expression; frontal bossing, with eventual hypertelorism and narrow lips; a low-caries rate; drooling, and hypersalivation. They can have changes in salivary composition and content, which influences plaque and calculus and increases the risk of gingival and periodontal diseases. They also have difficulty in controlling oral muscles; a progressive decrease in number of tongue fungiform papillae, accompanied by lack of taste buds; and specific dysgeusia, but a normal sense of smell.

22237833|t|Impaired olfaction and other prodromal features in the Parkinson At-Risk Syndrome Study.
22237833|a|To test the association between impaired olfaction and other prodromal features of PD in the Parkinson At-Risk Syndrome Study. The onset of olfactory dysfunction in PD typically precedes motor features, suggesting that olfactory testing could be used as a screening test. A combined strategy that uses other prodromal nonmotor features, along with olfactory testing, may be more efficient than hyposmia alone for detecting the risk of PD. Individuals with no neurological diagnosis completed a mail survey, including the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, and questions on prodromal features of PD. The frequency of reported nonmotor features was compared across individuals with and without hyposmia. A total of 4,999 subjects completed and returned the survey and smell test. Of these, 669 were at or below the 15th percentile based on age and gender, indicating hyposmia. Hyposmics were significantly more likely to endorse nonmotor features, including anxiety and depression, constipation, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder symptoms, and to report changes in motor function. Twenty-six percent of subjects with combinations of four or more nonmotor features were hyposmic, compared to 12% for those reporting three or fewer nonmotor features (P < 0.0001). Hyposmia is associated with other nonmotor features of PD in undiagnosed individuals. Further assessment of hyposmic subjects using more specific markers for degeneration, such as dopamine transporter imaging, will evaluate whether combining hyposmia and other nonmotor features is useful in assessing the risk of future neurodegeneration.

22722638|t|Retrospective survey of prodromal symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies: comparison with Alzheimer's disease.
22722638|a|BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms are recognized to enable the early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). It remains unknown when those symptoms appear in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHOD: We investigated the prevalence of 15 non-motor symptoms of PD at the onset of memory loss based on a standardized worksheet in 34 patients with DLB, 32 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 30 normal controls. RESULTS: DLB patients exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, constipation, increased saliva and signs of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at the onset of memory loss than AD patients and normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Paying attention to non-motor symptoms of PD may help DLB diagnosis in the early stage, especially in terms of its differentiation from AD.

22762860|t|Self-reported oral complaints in older mentally ill patients.
22762860|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of self-reported oral complaints in older hospitalized mentally ill patients and relate them to the primary psychiatric diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 89 older hospitalized psychiatric patients consented to participate in the study, and were interviewed and clinically examined. The medical data were obtained from the hospital's medical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 73 years (range 59-94 years). A total of 54% suffered from psychotic disorders, 26% from dementia and 20% from mood disorders. The most common oral complaint was xerostomia (45%), followed by dysgeusia (28%), oral malodor (26%), pain when chewing (25%), burning mouth (23%), chewing difficulties (12%) and sialorrhoea (2%). The prevalence of burning mouth, dysgeusia and oral malodor differed significantly among psychiatric diagnoses and was increased in patients with mood disorders. A close association was recorded between burning mouth, dysgeusia, xerostomia and oral malodor complaints. Stepwise logistic regression showed that the use of antidepressants and burning mouth complaints were significantly associated with mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: An increased prevalence of oral complaints was recorded in the elderly psychiatric patients with mood disorders. Those patients should be systematically evaluated and managed for oral complaints, and particularly for burning mouth. The close association between burning mouth complaints and mood disorders requires further investigation to clarify the potential diagnostic value of the symptom for mood disorders.

22791905|t|Olfactory impairment in familial ataxias.
22791905|a|The main clinical manifestations of the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) result from the involvement of the cerebellum and its connections. Cerebellar activity has been consistently observed in functional imaging studies of olfaction, but the anatomical pathways responsible for this connection have not yet been elucidated. Previous studies have demonstrated olfactory deficit in SCA2, Friedreich's ataxia and in small groups of ataxia of diverse aetiology. The authors used a validated version of the 16-item smell identification test from Sniffin' Sticks (SS-16) was used to evaluate 37 patients with genetically determined autosomal dominant ataxia, and 31 with familial ataxia of unknown genetic basis. This data was also compared with results in 106 Parkinson's disease patients and 218 healthy controls. The SS-16 score was significantly lower in ataxia than in the control group (p<0.001, 95% CI for beta=0.55 to 1.90) and significantly higher in ataxia than in Parkinson's disease (p<0.001, 95% CI for beta=-4.58 to -3.00) when adjusted for age (p=0.001, 95% CI for beta=-0.05 to -0.01), gender (p=0.19) and history of tobacco use (p=0.41). When adjusted for general cognitive function, no significant difference was found between the ataxia and control groups. This study confirms previous findings of mild hyposmia in ataxia, and further suggests this may be due to general cognitive deficits rather than specific olfactory problems.

23100432|t|Loss of interleukin receptor-associated kinase 4 signaling suppresses amyloid pathology and alters microglial phenotype in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
23100432|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typified by the deposition of amyloid in the brain, which elicits a robust microglial-mediated inflammatory response that is associated with disease exacerbation and accelerated progression. Microglia are the principal immune effector cells in the brain and interact with fibrillar forms of Abeta (fAbeta) through a receptor complex that includes Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2/4/6 and their coreceptors. Interleukin receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are essential intracellular signaling molecules for transduction of TLR signals. Studies of mouse models of AD in which the individual TLRs are knocked out have produced conflicting results on roles of TLR signaling in amyloid homeostasis. Therefore, we disrupted a common downstream TLR signaling element, IRAK4. We report that microglial IRAK4 is necessary in vitro for fAbeta to activate the canonical pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading to activation of p38, JNK, and ERK MAP kinases and to generate reactive oxygen species. In vivo the loss of IRAK4 function results in decreased Abeta levels in a murine model of AD. This was associated with diminished microgliosis and astrogliosis in aged mice. Analysis of microglia isolated from the adult mouse brain revealed an altered pattern of gene expression associated with changes in microglial phenotype that were associated with expression of IRF transcription factors that govern microglial phenotype. Further, loss of IRAK4 function also promoted amyloid clearance mechanisms, including elevated expression of insulin-degrading enzyme. Finally, blocking IRAK function restored olfactory behavior. These data demonstrate that IRAK4 activation acts normally to regulate microglial activation status and influence amyloid homeostasis in the brain.

23299265|t|Subjective visual vertical perception and sense of smell in Parkinson disease.
23299265|a|This article describes an open cross-sectional observational study involving 47 participants with Parkinson disease (PD) and 47 (age- and sex-matched) nondisabled controls without PD. The aim was to determine the profiles of subjective visual vertical (SVV) perception and sense of smell perception in both groups. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between patients and controls on their smell test performance. Controls were more likely to correctly identify odors, with a median score of 10 out of 12 compared with 6.5 out of 12 for patients with PD. The median SVV error for the PD group when the frame was untilted was 0.75 degrees compared with 0.50 degrees for controls. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02). When the frame was tilted, the median SVV error for the PD group was 2.31 degrees compared with 2.00 degrees for controls (not statistically significant), with both groups showing similar distribution pattern of errors. There was no statistical correlation between number of correctly identified odors and an individual's SVV error. However, a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.45, p = 0.01) was found between Mini-Mental State Examination score and mean time taken to complete each rod and frame test in patients with PD, suggesting that SVV errors might be more correlated with cognitive function than with loss of sense of smell.

23419740|t|Novel behavioural characteristics of the APP(Swe)/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
23419740|a|In order to better understand animal models of Alzheimer's disease, novel phenotyping strategies have been established for transgenic mouse models. In line with this, the current study characterised male APPxPS1 transgenic mice on mixed C57BL/6JxC3H/HeJ background for the first time for social recognition memory, sensorimotor gating, and spatial memory using the cheeseboard test as an alternative to the Morris water maze. Furthermore, locomotion, anxiety, and fear conditioning were evaluated in transgenic and wild type-like animals. APPxPS1 males displayed task-dependent hyperlocomotion and anxiety behaviours and exhibited social recognition memory impairments compared to wild type-like littermates. Spatial learning and memory, fear conditioning, and sensorimotor gating were unaffected in APPxPS1 transgenic mice. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time social recognition memory deficits in male APPxPS1 mice and suggests that spatial learning and memory deficits reported in earlier studies are dependent on the sex and genetic background of the APPxPS1 mouse line used. Furthermore, particular test conditions of anxiety and spatial memory paradigms appear to impact on the behavioural response of this transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease.

23870619|t|Relationship of olfactory function with olfactory bulbus volume, disease duration and Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale scores in patients with early stage of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
23870619|a|We aimed to investigate the relationship between olfactory function and olfactory bulbus (OB) volume, disease duration and Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores in early stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was used for the evaluation of olfactory function. UPSIT scores for patients with Parkinson's disease were significantly lower than controls. There was no significant difference between stage 1 and stage 2 patients. OB volumes were higher in stage 1 and 2 patients than controls, but there was no statistical difference between the three groups. No significant correlation was found between UPSIT and UPDRS total scores, nor between UPSIT scores and disease duration in stage 1 and 2 patients. According to our results, we propose UPSIT be used as a screening test to diagnose presymptomatic patients, but not OB volumes.

23884929|t|Olfactory functions scale with circuit restoration in a rapidly reversible Alzheimer's disease model.
23884929|a|Neural circuits maintain a precise organization that is vital for normal brain functions and behaviors, but become disrupted during neurological disease. Understanding the connection between wiring accuracy and function to measure disease progression or recovery has been difficult because of the complexity of behavioral circuits. The olfactory system maintains well-defined neural connections that regenerate throughout life. We previously established a reversible in vivo model of Alzheimer's disease by overexpressing a humanized mutated amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Using this model, we currently show that hAPP is present in the OSN axons of mutant mice, which exhibit strong caspase3 signal and reduced synaptic protein expression by 3 weeks of age. In the olfactory bulb, we show that glomerular structure is distorted and OSN axonal convergence is lost. In vivo functional imaging experiments further demonstrate disruption of the glomerular circuitry, and behavioral assays reveal that olfactory function is significantly impaired. Because OSNs regenerate, we also tested if the system could recover from hAPP-induced disruption. We found that after 1 or 3 weeks of shutting-off hAPP expression, the glomerular circuit was partially restored both anatomically and functionally, with behavioral deficits similarly reversed. Interestingly, the degree of functional recovery tracked directly with circuit restoration. Together, these data demonstrate that hAPP-induced circuit disruption and subsequent recovery can occur rapidly and that behavior can provide a measure of circuit organization. Thus, olfaction may serve as a useful biomarker to both follow disease progression and gauge potential recovery.

24190794|t|Risk factors and prodromal markers and the development of Parkinson's disease.
24190794|a|Identification of risk factors and prodromal markers for Parkinson's disease (PD) and the understanding of the point in time of first occurrence is essential for the early detection of incident PD. In this three-center longitudinal, observational study, we evaluated the specific risk for PD associated with single or combinations of risk factors and prodromal markers. In addition, we evaluated which risk factors and prodromal markers emerge at which time before the diagnosis of PD. Of the 1,847 at-baseline PD-free individuals >= 50 years, 1,260 underwent the 5-year follow-up assessment. There were 21 cases of incident PD during the study period. Enlarged hyperechogenic substantia nigra was the most frequent baseline sign in individuals developing PD after 3 years (80.0 %) and 5 years (85.7 %) compared to healthy controls (17.5 %) followed by the occurrence of mild parkinsonian signs and hyposmia. Evaluation of the signs at the first follow-up assessment showed that individuals developing PD after two additional years showed the same pattern of signs as individuals who developed PD 3 years after baseline assessment.

24284418|t|Use of hyposmia and other non-motor symptoms to distinguish between drug-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease.
24284418|a|Drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP) secondary to antipsychotics and other dopamine antagonists is common and can be clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Making the correct diagnosis is essential as it has important implications both for management of the underlying psychiatric condition and potentially lifelong therapy with antiparkinsonian agents. Additionally, because Parkinsonism does not always resolve with withdrawal of the offending agent or can recur years later, DIP may sometimes represent unmasking of incipient PD. The problem is increasing in scope as antipsychotic drugs are prescribed for a widening variety of indications, and understanding the factors that distinguish pharmacologic from degenerative Parkinsonism represents a significant unmet need. In this review, we discuss the rationale and evidence for using pre-clinical manifestations of PD, particularly non-motor symptoms, to distinguish between the conditions.

24482154|t|Olfactory-related cortical atrophy is associated with olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
24482154|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is often associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and can precede characteristic motor symptoms by several years. Olfactory-related cortical atrophy has been reported in PD, although the extent and association between cortical atrophy and olfactory dysfunction have been controversial. The present study examined whether olfactory dysfunction is associated with gray matter (GM) volume in brain regions subserving primary and secondary olfactory processing. METHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted brain MRIs were acquired from 40 PD without dementia and 40 matched controls along with smell identification scores. Brain volumes were compared using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Compared to controls, PD patients sustained greater GM loss localized to bilateral piriform cortex (PC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Reduced olfactory performance in PD was significantly associated with lower GM volumes in PC and OFC. CONCLUSIONS: Both primary and secondary olfactory cortical atrophy occurred in PD and were associated with olfactory dysfunction.

24655736|t|How does smoking affect olfaction in Parkinson's disease?
24655736|a|Smoke-induced upper airway damage and Parkinson's disease (PD) can be considered independent risk factors for smell impairment. Interestingly, cigarette smoking has been strongly associated with reduced risk of PD and, therefore, has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects. Our pilot study aimed to evaluate the relationship between smoking and olfaction in PD patients and matched controls. Sixty-eight PD patients and 61 healthy controls were categorized in relation to PD diagnosis and current smoking status, and evaluated by means of the Italian version of the University of Pennsylvania 40-item Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-40). ANOVA analysis with post-hoc Bonferroni correction showed that non-smoker controls presented a higher UPSIT-40 total score than smoker controls (p<0.001), non-smoker PD patients (p<0.001) and smoker PD patients (p<0.001). In this view, smoking seems to affect olfaction in controls but not in PD patients, and no significant differences were found when comparing smoker controls, smoker PD patients and non-smoker PD patients. Several epidemiological studies showed a negative effect of smoking on olfaction in the general population. Otherwise the sense of smell is similar in smoker and non-smoker PD patients. These results suggest that PD and smoking are not independent risk factors for impairment of sense of smell, but they might variably interact.

24839905|t|Diagnostic value of combined assessment of olfaction and sustantia nigra hyperechogenicity for Parkinson's disease.
24839905|a|INTRODUCTION: Hyposmia and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SN+) are characteristic markers of Parkinson's disease (PD), although their diagnostic value in isolation may be limited. We evaluated the combined prevalence of both disorders in patients diagnosed with PD and assessed their diagnostic yield compared to a sample with essential tremor (ET) and another group of healthy subjects. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with PD and ET and treated in our outpatient clinic were enrolled. Olfaction was assessed using the "Sniffin' Sticks" odour identification test (SS-12) and hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (SN+) was assessed by transcranial duplex ultrasound. RESULTS: A total of 98 subjects were analysed, comprising 30 with PD, 21 with ET, and 47 controls. The respective prevalence rates of hyposmia (SS-12 < 8) and SN+ (area > .24cm(2)) were 70% and 83.3% in PD, 33.3% and 9.5% in ET, and 17% and 10.6% in controls. Both markers were present in 63% of patients with PD, none of the patients with ET, and only 2 of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Combined use of substantia nigra sonography and olfactory testing with SS-12, two rapid, safe, and accessible tests, was more specific than each isolated marker for distinguishing patients with PD from patients with ET and control subjects. Since both markers have been described in very early phases of PD, combined use may be helpful in providing early diagnosis of PD.

25609758|t|Olfactory dysfunction predicts early transition to a Lewy body disease in idiopathic RBD.
25609758|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive value of olfactory dysfunction for the early development of a synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative disease in subjects with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) over an observational period of 5 years. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD underwent olfactory testing using the entire Sniffin' Sticks test assessing odor identification, odor discrimination, and olfactory threshold. Patients with iRBD were prospectively followed up over a period of 4.9 +- 0.3 years (mean +- SD). The diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases was based on current clinical diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: After 2.4 +- 1.7 years (mean +- SD), 9 patients (26.5%) with iRBD developed a Lewy body disease (6 Parkinson disease and 3 dementia with Lewy bodies). The entire Sniffin' Sticks test and the identification subtest had the same overall diagnostic accuracy of 82.4% (95% confidence interval: 66.1%-92.0%) in predicting conversion. The relative risk for a Lewy body disease in the lowest tertile of olfactory function was 7.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-29.6) compared with the top 2 tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of olfactory function, particularly odor identification, may help to predict the development of a Lewy body disease in patients with iRBD over a relatively short time period and thus to identify patients suitable for future disease modification trials.

25912367|t|The olfactory bulb volume in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
25912367|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study addresses the question of whether the neuropathological findings on the olfactory bulb (OB) in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) correspond to a detectable change in volume of the OB. Additionally, the relationship between OB volume and residual olfactory function, clinical disease characteristics and age are investigated. METHODS: Fifty-two IPD patients were investigated and compared to 31 healthy age-matched controls. All participants were scanned using a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging MRI scanner including a T2 DRIVE sequence in coronal slices through the OB. The OB volumes were measured via manual segmentation of the OB. Olfactory testing was carried out using the Sniffin' Sticks test battery. RESULTS: The OB volume in the IPD group was 42.1 mm3 (SD +- 11.6) for the right and 41.5 mm3 (SD +- 11.7) for the left OB and showed no difference from the controls. Additionally, there were no significant correlations between OB volume and disease characteristics such as disease duration or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score. Likewise, patients' residual smell function did not correlate with their OB volume. In contrast, controls indicated a correlation between smell function and OB volume. CONCLUSION: The study shows that high resolution MRI does not show a detectable volume loss of the OB in PD patients. It is concluded that OB measurement using in vivo high resolution MRI at 3 T is not helpful to identify IPD.

25921825|t|Hyposmia correlates with SNCA variant and non-motor symptoms in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease.
25921825|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia plays an important role in the early and differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD); however its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The aim of the present study is to explore the clinical phenotypic and genotypic correlation of hyposmia in Chinese PD patients. METHODS: Olfactory function evaluated by 16-item odor identification test from Sniffin' Sticks (SS-16) of 218 Chinese Han PD patients and 110 healthy controls was compared. 186 patients also had the genetic information of two positive GWAS-linked SNCA loci (rs11931074, rs894278) previously validated in our center. The associations of hyposmia with SNCA variants and disease phenotypic characteristics including motor symptoms (UPDRS motor score) and other common NMSs (clinical possible RBD-cpRBD, depression and chronic constipation) were analyzed. RESULTS: Nearly 39.9% (n = 87) of PD reported subjective complaints of hyposmia, while 60.1% (n = 131) patients had objective hyposmia (SS-16 < 8.3). Patients with hyposmia had older age (p = 0.001), later onset age (p = 0.020), higher SCOPA-AUT scores (p = 0.011), higher percentage of chronic constipation (p = 0.001) and cpRBD (p = 0.003). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that ageing (OR = 1.058; 95%CI: 1.012-1.106; p = 0.013), chronic constipation (OR = 2.072; 95% CI: 1.157-3.710; p = 0.014) and cpRBD (OR = 2.234; 95% CI: 1.040-4.797; p = 0.039) were independent influential factors of hyposmia in Chinese PD patients. Subgroup analysis of patients with both clinical and genetic results demonstrated that after adjusting for age, sex, chronic constipation and cpRBD, rs11931074 TT genotype may increase the risk of hyposmia in PD (OR = 3.24 95% CI = 1.23-8.51, p = 0.017) compared to GG genotype via an additive model. CONCLUSIONS: Age, cpRBD, chronic constipation and SNCA rs11931074 may correlate with hyposmia in Chinese PD patients.

26616239|t|Interneurons in the human olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.
26616239|a|The principal olfactory structures display Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathology at early stages of the disease. Consequently, olfactory deficits are among the earliest symptoms. Reliable olfactory tests for accurate clinical diagnosis are rarely made. In addition, neuropathological analysis postmortem of olfactory structures is often not made. Therefore, the relationship between the clinical features and the underlying pathology is poorly defined. Traditionally, research into Alzheimer's disease has focused on the degeneration of cortical temporal projection neurons and cholinergic neurons. Recent evidence has demonstrated the neurodegeneration of interneuron populations in AD. This review provides an updated overview of the pathological involvement of interneuron populations in the human olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.

26923521|t|Olfactory impairment predicts cognitive decline in early Parkinson's disease.
26923521|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between baseline olfaction and both cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive assessments, motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms (NMS), and CSF biomarkers in early Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) participants underwent baseline olfactory testing with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Serial assessments included measures of motor symptoms, NMS, neuropsychological assessment, and CSF biomarkers. Up to three years follow-up data were included. RESULTS: At baseline, worse olfaction (lowest tertile) was associated with more severe NMS, including anxiety and autonomic symptoms. Those in the lowest olfactory tertile were more likely to report cognitive impairment (37.4%) compared to those in the middle (24.4%) and highest olfactory tertiles (14.2%, p < 0.001). Abeta1-42 was significantly lower, and tau/Abeta1-42 ratio was higher in those with worse olfaction. In longitudinal analyses, lower UPSIT score was associated with greater decline in MoCA score (beta = 0.02 [0.01, 0.03], p = 0.001) over time, as were composite measures of UPSIT score and either Abeta1-42 or tau/Abeta1-42 ratio. In a Cox proportional hazards model, a composite measure of olfaction and Abeta1-42 was a significant predictor of conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI; i.e., MoCA < 26), with subjects most impaired on both measures being 87% more likely to develop incident MCI (HR = 1.87 [1.16, 3.01], p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Worse baseline olfaction is associated with long-term cognitive decline. The addition of AD CSF biomarkers to olfactory testing may increase the likelihood of identifying those at highest risk for cognitive decline and progression to MCI.

27103193|t|High-Accuracy Detection of Early Parkinson's Disease through Multimodal Features and Machine Learning.
27103193|a|Early (or preclinical) diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is crucial for its early management as by the time manifestation of clinical symptoms occur, more than 60% of the dopaminergic neurons have already been lost. It is now established that there exists a premotor stage, before the start of these classic motor symptoms, characterized by a constellation of clinical features, mostly non-motor in nature such as Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. In this paper, we use the non-motor features of RBD and olfactory loss, along with other significant biomarkers such as Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements and dopaminergic imaging markers from 183 healthy normal and 401 early PD subjects, as obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, to classify early PD subjects from normal using Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Boosted Trees and Random Forests classifiers. We observe that SVM classifier gave the best performance (96.40% accuracy, 97.03% sensitivity, 95.01% specificity, and 98.88% area under ROC). We infer from the study that a combination of non-motor, CSF and imaging markers may aid in the preclinical diagnosis of PD.

27206870|t|Olfactory dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis.
27206870|a|Association of changes in olfactory-related structures with olfactory function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not well understood. We used a T&T olfactometer test kit to evaluate olfactory function in 26 patients with MS and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Then, Brain MRI were performed and olfactory-related structures were analyzed in these subjects. Olfactory detection and recognition threshold were significantly higher in the MS group, interestingly olfactory recognition threshold positively correlated with expanded disability status scale scores in these patients. Olfactory bulb (OB) volume reduced in patients with olfactory dysfunction (ODF). At the same time, reductions in gray matter (GM) volume were observed in the parahippocampal gyrus (PCG), amygdala, piriform cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus in patients with MS compared to HC. Atrophy of the PCG was more obvious in patients with ODF than patients without ODF and the PCG volume correlated with the olfactory recognition threshold, while no difference was found in fractional anisotropy values of tract-based spatial statistics analysis in the two groups. Olfactory function in patients with MS tends to become gradually more impaired with disability aggravation. Decreases in the volume of the OB and olfactory-related GM might provide valuable information about disease status in patients with MS with olfactory impairment.

27393383|t|Predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo Parkinson's disease.
27393383|a|Postprandial hypotension is one of the most important autonomic disorders in Parkinson's disease. However, its predictors remain unclear. We investigated which variable(s) predict the presence of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. The subjects were 64 patients with de novo Parkinson's disease who were 70 years or older. Postprandial hypotension was evaluated on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Olfactory function, constipation, cardiac sympathetic or parasympathetic denervation, orthostatic intolerance on head-up tilt table testing, and other baseline characteristics were evaluated. The results showed the presence of postprandial hypotension was associated with severe dysosmia, constipation, orthostatic hypotension (a decrease in systolic blood pressure >=30 mmHg) and preprandial hypertension at rest. On multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, symptom duration, disease severity, and motor subtype, the odds ratio was 4.02 for severe dysosmia (p = 0.027), 9.99 for constipation (p = 0.006), 6.42 for orthostatic hypotension with alternative definition (p = 0.004) and 7.90 for preprandial hypertension at rest (p = 0.001). Each multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex was also a risk factor for postprandial hypotension. The variables with the highest sensitivity and specificity for postprandial hypotension were constipation (89.6 %) and preprandial hypertension at rest or orthostatic hypotension with alternative definition (both 77.1 %), respectively. Our results suggest that these variables predict the presence of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease, suggesting that postprandial hypotension shares etiologic factors with these potential predictors.

27606803|a|AIMS: To confirm whether the presence and/or timing of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) onset were associated with differences in clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD), clinical characteristics of PD patients with RBD occurring before and after PD diagnosis were investigated. METHODS: Consecutive PD patients were enrolled between July 2011 and February 2012. RBD questionnaire Hong Kong and clinical interviews were used to identify RBD symptoms and onsets. All patients underwent evaluations to collect clinical and treatment information. RESULTS: Of all 79 PD patients, 21 (26.6%) and 22 (27.8%) patients had RBD prior to (RBD-PD) and after PD diagnosis (PD-RBD), respectively. Thirty-six (45.6%) PD patients reported no RBD at the time of study (PD-NRBD). PD-RBD had similar clinical features as PD-NRBD did except that Epworth sleepiness scale score was significantly higher in PD-RBD (p = 0.04). Compared to PD-RBD and PD-NRBD, RBD-PD had a higher frequency of reporting excessive daytime sleepiness (p = 0.019, p = 0.008, respectively) and constipation (p = 0.046, p = 0.032, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that RBD-PD might be clinically different from PD-RBD, which appears to share similar characteristics with PD-NRBD, regarding only non-motor functions.

27888574|t|Normal 'heart' in Parkinson's disease: is this a distinct clinical phenotype?
27888574|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reduction of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake has been observed in almost all patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with hyposmia, orthostatic hypotension and rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder (RBD). In contrast, a subgroup of patients with PD with normal MIBG uptake have been reported to have milder disease and preserved cognition compared with those with lower MIBG. The aim of this study was to investigate whether non-motor manifestations of PD differ between patients with normal and abnormal myocardial MIBG uptake. METHODS: Among 160 de-novo cases of PD, 44 had normal MIBG uptake. Twelve candidate non-motor features were evaluated using questionnaires and laboratory tests. RESULTS: Patients with decreased MIBG uptake had more constipation, RBD, cognitive impairment, hyposmia and orthostatic hypotension than did those with normal MIBG uptake. On linear regression analysis, orthostatic hypotension, olfactory function and probable RBD were significantly associated with MIBG uptake in PD. The principal component analysis showed that the group with normal MIBG was not associated with non-motor impairments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients with PD with normal MIBG scans have a relatively low disease burden compared with those with abnormal MIBG. Fewer synuclein pathologies in the myocardia and sympathetic ganglia in PD with preserved MIBG uptake might be associated with lower threshold patterns of Braak synuclein pathology for non-motor manifestations compared with PD with decreased MIBG.

28414538|t|Part 3: Impact of systemic conditions and medications on oral health.
28414538|a|The people who are treated in the community setting will often have multiple comorbidities. Systemic medical conditions can have a negative impact on oral health. In addition, the medications used to treat systemic conditions may also themselves cause oral symptoms. As a large proportion of patients treated by the community nursing team will be elderly, this paper will focus on common geriatric conditions that can display oral or dental symptoms. The effects of medications will be discussed and linked to oral complaints patients may express. The primary aims are to give a broad overview of the oral effects of ageing, of illness and of polypharmacy and advise on how these can be best managed by the nursing team.

28637374|t|Facial emotion recognition in Parkinson's disease: Association with age and olfaction.
28637374|a|OBJECTIVE: The ability to recognize facial emotion expressions has been reported to be impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet previous studies showed inconsistent findings. The aim of this study was to further investigate facial emotion recognition (FER) in PD patients and its association with demographic and clinical parameters (including motor and nonmotor symptoms). METHOD: Thirty-four nondemented PD patients and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) underwent clinical neurological and neuropsychological assessment, standardized olfactory testing with Sniffin' Sticks, and the Ekman 60 Faces Emotion Recognition Test. RESULTS: PD patients had a significantly lower score on the total FER task than HC (p = .006), even after controlling for the potential confounding factors depression and apathy. The PD group had a specific impairment in the recognition of surprise (p = .007). The recognition of anger approached statistical significance (p = .07). Increasing chronological age and age at disease onset were associated with worse performance on the FER task in PD patients. Olfactory function along with PD diagnosis predicted worse FER performance within all study participants. CONCLUSION: Facial emotion recognition and especially the recognition of surprise are significantly impaired in PD patients compared with age- and sex-matched HC. The association of FER with age and olfactory function is endorsed by common structures that undergo neurodegeneration in PD. The relevance of FER in social interaction stresses the clinical relevance and the need for further investigation in this field. Future studies should also determine whether impaired FER is already present in premotor stages of PD.

28674978|t|Parkinson's Disease: Basic Pathomechanisms and a Clinical Overview.
28674978|a|PD is a common and a debilitating degenerative movement disorder. The number of patients is increasing worldwide and as yet there is no cure for the disease. The majority of existing treatments target motor symptom control. Over the last two decades the impact of the genetic contribution to PD has been appreciated. Significant discoveries have been made, which have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiological and molecular basis of PD. In this chapter we outline current knowledge of the clinical aspects of PD and the basic mechanistic understanding.

28802918|t|Genes and Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.
28802918|a|Published data on genetic risk factors of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are relatively lacking since the first mutation responsible for Parkinson's disease (PD) being reported in 1996. This chapter provides a concise summary of genetic links to common individual NMS such as cognitive impairment, depression, psychosis, olfactory dysfunction, pain, and sleep disorders. Although some genetic variants such as apolipoprotein E and glucocerebrosidase demonstrate consistent links with certain NMS, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions. A concerted effort involving standardized protocol in multiple centers and multiethnic groups will be useful to further investigate the association. With the help of high-throughput genomic techniques, more causative genes and novel genes will be discovered in the future and this will contribute further to the understanding of genetic susceptibility of NMS in PD.

28802919|t|Nonmotor Signs in Genetic Forms of Parkinson's Disease.
28802919|a|Although only a minority (i.e., ~5%) of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases is due to well-defined genetic causes, important clues about the common, "idiopathic" PD (iPD) can be garnered from monogenic model diseases. Nonmotor signs (NMS) are also present in monogenic PD and reviewed in this chapter for the confirmed PD genes SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, and the risk factor gene GBA. Within the context of the MDSGene database (www.mdsgene.org), we performed a systematic literature search and extracted information on cognitive decline, depression, psychotic signs and symptoms, autonomic signs and symptoms, anxiety, sleep disorder, and olfactory impairment. Notably, relatively few studies specifically addressed NMS in genetic PD and missing data ranged from 42% to 100%. Diagnostic criteria and examination methods were variable and cases differed widely for age at onset, disease duration, ethnicity, treatment, and comorbidity. Although in comparison to IPD, SNCA duplication carriers have the most similar course of disease, even for duplication carriers the frequencies of dementia, hallucinations, and depression seem higher than in IPD. Supporting the notion that LRRK2-linked PD has a similar course to iPD but is slightly more benign, the frequency of dementia is below that of iPD. For Parkin, the frequency of cognitive decline falls within the range of the general population above the age of 65 years. GBA mutations are associated with a distinct profile of cognitive impairment and a greater prevalence of depression. Despite the current data gaps, NMS should be considered as an important and often treatable concomitant feature of genetic parkinsonism.

28803382|t|Cortical afferent inhibition abnormalities reveal cholinergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: a reappraisal.
28803382|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder affecting, besides the dopaminergic function, multiple neurotransmission systems, including the cholinergic system. Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by coupling peripheral nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex; this test is named short latency afferent inhibition (SAI). SAI abnormalities have been reported in PD patients with gait disturbances and many non-motor symptoms, such as visual hallucinations (VHs), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), dysphagia, and olfactory impairment. The findings of these TMS studies strongly suggest that cholinergic degeneration is an important contributor to a number of clinical features of PD. TMS and neuropsychological raise the possibility that the presence of RBD, VHs and olfactory dysfunction indicate increased risk of cognitive impairment in patients with PD. Longitudinal studies of the patients are required to verify whether SAI abnormalities can predict a future severe cognitive decline. TMS can provide simple measures that may represent suitable biomarkers of cholinergic neurotransmission in PD. SAI studies enable an early recognition of PD patients with cholinergic system degeneration, and this might allow future targeted cholinergic treatment approaches, in addition to dopaminergic therapy, to ameliorate non-motor and motor clinical symptoms in PD patients.

28878051|t|Olfaction and incident Parkinson disease in US white and black older adults.
28878051|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate olfaction in relation to incident Parkinson disease (PD) in US white and black older adults. METHODS: The study included 1,510 white (mean age 75.6 years) and 952 black (75.4 years) participants of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. We evaluated the olfaction of study participants with the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) in 1999-2000. We retrospectively adjudicated PD cases identified through August 31, 2012, using multiple data sources. We used multivariable Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During an average of 9.8 years of follow-up, we identified a total of 42 incident PD cases, including 30 white and 12 black participants. Overall, poor sense of smell, as indicated by a lower BSIT score, was associated with higher risk of PD. Compared with the highest tertile of BSIT (t3), the HR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.5-3.6) for the second tertile (t2) and 4.8 (95% CI 2.0-11.2) for the lowest tertile (t1) (ptrend < 0.00001). Further analyses revealed significant associations for incident PD in both the first 5 years of follow-up (HRt1/[t2+t3] 4.2, 95% CI 1.7-10.8) and thereafter (HRt1/[t2+t3] 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-9.8). This association appeared to be stronger in white (HRt1/[t2+t3] 4.9, 95% CI 2.3-10.5) than in black participants (HRt1/[t2+t3] 2.5, 95% CI 0.8-8.1), and in men (HRt1/[t2+t3] 5.4, 95% CI 2.3-12.9) than in women (HRt1/[t2+t3] 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8). CONCLUSIONS: Poor olfaction predicts PD in short and intermediate terms; the possibility of stronger associations among men and white participants warrants further investigation.

29380907|t|Dopamine reuptake transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography and transcranial sonography as imaging markers of prediagnostic Parkinson's disease.
29380907|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine whether prediagnostic features of Parkinson's disease (PD) were associated with changes in dopamine reuptake transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography and transcranial sonography. METHODS: Prediagnostic features of PD (risk estimates, University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire, and finger-tapping scores) were assessed in a large cohort of older U.K. residents. A total of 46 participants were included in analyses of prediagnostic features and MDS-UPDRS scores with the striatal binding ratio on dopamine reuptake transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography and nigral hyperechogenicity on transcranial sonography. RESULTS: The striatal binding ratio was associated with PD risk estimates (P = .040), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (P = .002), Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire scores (P = .024), tapping speed (P = .024), and MDS-UPDRS motor scores (P = .009). Remotely collected assessments explained 26% of variation in the striatal binding ratio. The inclusion of MDS-UPDRS motor scores did not explain additional variance. The size of the nigral echogenic area on transcranial sonography was associated with risk estimates (P < .001) and MDS-UPDRS scores (P = .03) only. CONCLUSIONS: The dopamine reuptake transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography results correlated with motor and nonmotor features of prediagnostic PD, supporting its potential use as a marker in the prodromal phase of PD. Transcranial sonography results also correlated with risk scores and motor signs.   2018 The Authors.

29438043|t|Selective cognitive impairment and hyposmia in p.A53T SNCA PD vs typical PD.
29438043|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nonmotor symptoms in early SNCA/p.A53T Parkinson disease (PD) (A53T PD) compared to typical PD (tPD). METHODS: The presence of hyposmia, neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, and sleep disturbances was assessed by standardized questionnaires and validated scales in 18 patients with A53T PD and 18 patients with tPD, matched for age, sex, and disease duration. All patients were enrolled into the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative study. RESULTS: The levodopa equivalent daily dose was higher in the A53T PD (p = 0.018) group vs the tPD group. Scores on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (p = 0.001), Benton Judgement of Line Orientation test (p = 0.001), Letter Number Sequencing Test (p = 0.002), and phonemic verbal fluency (p = 0.002) were lower in the A53T PD group vs the tPD group. In contrast, overall cognition, verbal memory, and semantic fluency were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: The observed selective cognitive impairment reflecting frontal-parietal network dysfunction, together with impaired olfaction, define a set of nonmotor dysfunctions related to A53T PD. These results have implications for the prognosis of patients with A53T PD. Moreover, as the archetypal alpha-synucleinopathy, such results may give insights into tPD.

29438044|t|Impairment of cross-modality of vision and olfaction in Parkinson disease.
29438044|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Parkinson disease (PD) affects cross-modal function of vision and olfaction because it is known that PD impairs various cognitive functions, including olfaction. METHODS: We conducted behavioral experiments to identify the influence of PD on cross-modal function by contrasting patient performance with age-matched normal controls (NCs). We showed visual effects on the strength and preference of odor by manipulating semantic connections between picture/odorant pairs. In addition, we used brain imaging to identify the role of striatal presynaptic dopamine transporter (DaT) deficits. RESULTS: We found that odor evaluation in participants with PD was unaffected by visual information, while NCs overestimated smell when sniffing odorless liquid while viewing pleasant/unpleasant visual cues. Furthermore, DaT deficit in striatum, for the posterior putamen in particular, correlated to few visual effects in participants with PD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PD impairs cross-modal function of vision/olfaction as a result of posterior putamen deficit. This cross-modal dysfunction may serve as the basis of a novel precursor assessment of PD.

29477459|t|Substantia nigra fractional anisotropy changes confirm the PD at-risk status of patients with idiopathic smell loss.
29477459|a|INTRODUCTION: Individuals with unexplained smell loss constitute an at-risk population for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently, no specific MRI patterns are known for early PD diagnosis. In this study, we measured the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the substantia nigra (SN) in PD patients, in patients with idiopathic smell loss, and in healthy controls. METHODS: All subjects underwent extensive olfactory testing and MR imaging data were obtained to explore SN diffusion characteristics. The SN regions were manually identified by two independent raters on the individual imaging data. RESULTS: FA measurements in the SN revealed significant group differences, with reduced values clearly distinguishing PD patients and patients with idiopathic smell loss from healthy controls. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a reduced intrinsic integrity of the SN in PD at-risk subjects and support the risk status of patients with idiopathic smell loss.

29664936|t|Olfactory dysfunction as a prognostic marker for disability progression in Multiple Sclerosis: An olfactory event related potential study.
29664936|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease and one of the leading causes of disability in young adults. Functional markers able to predict MS progression are still lacking. It is recognized that olfactory dysfunction may be an early symptom in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether alterations in olfactory event-related potentials could play a prognostic role in MS. Thirty patients affected by MS relapsing-remitting underwent an olfactory potential examination (T0). Three years after baseline (T1), 28 of 30 patients were clinically evaluated by expanded disability status scale. In addition, the number of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) and the total number of relapses occurred in the last 3 years were collected. At T1, we observed a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and expanded disability status scale scores (rpb = -0.48; p = 0.009). A significant trend for a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and disease duration (rpb = -0.36; p = 0.06) and total number of relapses (rpb = -0.34; p = 0.08) was found. Only patients with olfactory potential absence showed a significant trend in the difference of the disability status scale (p = 0.06) between T0 and T1. In the sub-group of patients with reduced olfactory potential amplitude, we detected a trend for a negative correlation between the disability status scale and the amplitude of N1-P2 components more marked at T1 (r = -0.52; p = 0.06) than T0 (r = -0.47; p = 0.09). This is the first study that evaluated the prognostic role of olfactory event-related potentials in MS. Our results highlighted that olfactory alterations of MS patients were related to disability progression and, to a lesser extent, disease activity. The analysis of olfactory potential parameters confirmed the involvement in olfactory network damage of inflammatory and/or neurodegeneration processes which could predict the progressive course of the disease.

29742909|t|Olfactory Testing in Frontotemporal Dementia: A Literature Review.
29742909|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous disorder featuring language impairment, personality changes, and executive defects, often due to the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Both FTD and FTLD are often associated with olfactory impairment, early biomarker for neurodegeneration, which can be evaluated with different techniques, among which low-cost olfactory tests are widely used. Therefore, we conducted a review of the literature focusing on papers published between January 1, 2007, and June 12, 2017, investigating the usefulness of olfactory testing in FTD/FTLD. A general decrease in the olfactory identification ability was seen in most of the articles and, taken together with a preserved odor discrimination, reveals a higher order impairment, possibly linked to cognitive decrease or language impairments, and not to a specific deficit of the olfactory system. This evidence could represent a useful add-on to the current literature, increasing the diagnostic value of olfactory assessment, particularly in cases where differential diagnosis is difficult.

30145631|t|Diagnostic biomarkers for Parkinson's disease at a glance: where are we?
30145631|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder whose aetiology remains unclear: degeneration involves several neurotransmission systems, resulting in a heterogeneous disease characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. PD causes progressive disability that responds only to symptomatic therapies. Future advances include neuroprotective strategies for use in at-risk populations before the clinical onset of disease, hence the continuing need to identify reliable biomarkers that can facilitate the clinical diagnosis of PD. In this evaluative review, we summarize information on potential diagnostic biomarkers for use in the clinical and preclinical stages of PD.

30337611|t|Matured Hop-Derived Bitter Components in Beer Improve Hippocampus-Dependent Memory Through Activation of the Vagus Nerve.
30337611|a|Improving and maintaining memory function is effective in preventing cognitive decline and dementia. Previously, we demonstrated that iso-alpha-acids, the hop-derived bitter components in beer, prevent cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. In this report, we investigated the effects of matured hop bitter acids (MHBA) containing components of oxides derived from alpha- and beta-acids, and structurally similar to iso-alpha-acids, on cognitive function using behavioral pharmacological procedures. MHBA and the representative components of MHBA, 4'-hydroxyallohumulinone (HAH) and 4'-hydroxy-cis-alloisohumulone (HAIH) improved spatial working memory in scopolamine-induced amnesia mice. MHBA also enhanced episodic memory in the novel object recognition test (NORT). The administration of MHBA increased the amount of norepinephrine (NE) and NE release into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in hippocampus. The MHBA activity in improving memory function was attenuated by treatment with a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. In addition, vagotomized mice did not display the memory improvement induced by MHBA. Together, our results suggest that MHBA improves memory function via stimulation of the vagus nerve and enhancement of NE release in the hippocampus. Vagus nerve activation by the intake of food materials including MHBA may be a safe and effective approach for improving cognitive function.

30895860|t|Impairment of odor discrimination and identification is associated with disability progression and gray matter atrophy of the olfactory system in MS.
30895860|a|BACKGROUND: Impairment of odor discrimination (D), identification (I), and threshold (T) are characteristic features of multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: To identify patterns of gray matter concentration (GMC) associated with different qualities of olfactory function. METHODS: Olfactory function (T and combined DI score) was measured by Sniffin' Sticks-Test over 2 years longitudinally, and T1-weighted 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 37 MS patients and 18 matched healthy controls (HCs). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied to objectively identify changes of voxel-wise-GMC throughout the entire brain volume and to correlate image parameters with odor function. RESULTS: SPM localized significant GMC decreases in the anterior cingulum as well as temporomesial and frontobasal brain areas of the MS group compared with HCs, and revealed significant correlations between lower DI scores and GMC decreases in the olfactory gyrus, anterior cingulum, temporal regions including the parahippocampus, and putamen. Contrarily, no correlations were found between T and GMC. Patients with disability progression had significantly lower mean temporomesial/putamen GMC (0.782 vs 0.804, p = 0.004) compared to patients without Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression. CONCLUSION: Impairment of DI, but not T is associated with GM atrophy in brain regions related to olfactory function. Further studies are warranted to investigate DI scores and temporomesial/putamen GMC as biomarkers for disability progression.

31361367|t|Longitudinal analyses of cerebrospinal fluid alpha-Synuclein in prodromal and early Parkinson's disease.
31361367|a|BACKGROUND: Aggregation of alpha-synuclein is central to the pathophysiology of PD. Biomarkers related to alpha-synuclein may be informative for PD diagnosis/progression. OBJECTIVES: To analyze alpha-synuclein in CSF in drug-naive PD, healthy controls, and prodromal PD in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. METHODS: Over up to 36-month follow-up, CSF total alpha-synuclein and its association with MDS-UPDRS motor scores, cognitive assessments, and dopamine transporter imaging were assessed. RESULTS: The inception cohort included PD (n = 376; age [mean {standard deviation} years]: 61.7 [9.62]), healthy controls (n = 173; age, 60.9 [11.3]), hyposmics (n = 16; age, 68.3 [6.15]), and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (n = 32; age, 69.3 [4.83]). Baseline CSF alpha-synuclein was lower in manifest and prodromal PD versus healthy controls. Longitudinal alpha-synuclein decreased significantly in PD at 24 and 36 months, did not change in prodromal PD over 12 months, and trended toward an increase in healthy controls. The decrease in PD was not shown when CSF samples with high hemoglobin concentration were removed from the analysis. CSF alpha-synuclein changes did not correlate with longitudinal MDS-UPDRS motor scores or dopamine transporter scan. CONCLUSIONS: CSF alpha-synuclein decreases early in the disease, preceding motor PD. CSF alpha-synuclein does not correlate with progression and therefore does not reflect ongoing dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Decreased CSF alpha-synuclein may be an indirect index of changes in the balance between alpha-synuclein secretion, solubility, or aggregation in the brain, reflecting its overall turnover. Additional biomarkers more directly related to alpha-synuclein pathophysiology and disease progression and other markers to be identified by, for example, proteomics and metabolomics are needed.   2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

31816026|t|alpha-Synuclein BAC transgenic mice exhibit RBD-like behaviour and hyposmia: a prodromal Parkinson's disease model.
31816026|a|Parkinson's disease is one of the most common movement disorders and is characterized by dopaminergic cell loss and the accumulation of pathological alpha-synuclein, but its precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain elusive. To develop disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease, an animal model that recapitulates the pathology and symptoms of the disease, especially in the prodromal stage, is indispensable. As subjects with alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) multiplication as well as point mutations develop familial Parkinson's disease and a genome-wide association study in Parkinson's disease has identified SNCA as a risk gene for Parkinson's disease, the increased expression of alpha-synuclein is closely associated with the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. In this study we generated bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice harbouring SNCA and its gene expression regulatory regions in order to maintain the native expression pattern of alpha-synuclein. Furthermore, to enhance the pathological properties of alpha-synuclein, we inserted into SNCA an A53T mutation, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in a genome-wide association study in Parkinson's disease and a Rep1 polymorphism, all of which are causal of familial Parkinson's disease or increase the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease. These A53T SNCA bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice showed an expression pattern of human alpha-synuclein very similar to that of endogenous mouse alpha-synuclein. They expressed truncated, oligomeric and proteinase K-resistant phosphorylated forms of alpha-synuclein in the regions that are specifically affected in Parkinson's disease and/or dementia with Lewy bodies, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum and substantia nigra. Surprisingly, these mice exhibited rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia, which is a key feature of REM sleep behaviour disorder, at as early as 5 months of age. Consistent with this observation, the REM sleep-regulating neuronal populations in the lower brainstem, including the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus, nuclei in the ventromedial medullary reticular formation and the pedunculopontine nuclei, expressed phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. In addition, they also showed hyposmia at 9 months of age, which is consistent with the significant accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the olfactory bulb. The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta degenerated, and their number was decreased in an age-dependent manner by up to 17.1% at 18 months of age compared to wild-type, although the mice did not show any related locomotor dysfunction. In conclusion, we created a novel mouse model of prodromal Parkinson's disease that showed RBD-like behaviour and hyposmia without motor symptoms.

31989535|t|Parkinson's disease and the non-motor symptoms: hyposmia, weight loss, osteosarcopenia.
31989535|a|Non-motor symptoms (NMSs) are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and can precede, sometimes for several years. NMSs include, other than gastrointestinal symptoms like constipation and dysphagia, also hyposmia, weight loss and osteosarcopenia. These three NMSs seem to be inter-related and affect patients' health and quality of life. Unfortunately, patients with these symptoms usually are not initially seen by a neurologist, and by the time they are consulted, nearly ~ 80% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have died. To date, no guidelines exist for screening, assessment and management of NMSs in general. A better understanding of these specific NMSs, likely in the context of others, will make it possible to approach and optimise the treatment of the motor symptoms thereby enhancing the welfare of PD patients. Identifying the NMSs could be very helpful, and among them, hyposmia, weight loss and osteosarcopenia may play an important role in solving the limitations in the diagnosis of PD. A strict collaboration between general practitioners, clinicians, geriatricians and neurologists can be one approach towards the diagnosis of pre-PD. Waiting until the motor symptoms develop and the patient is finally visited by the neurologist could be too late, considering the catastrophic prognosis of the disease.

32092703|t|Non-motor symptoms and striatal dopamine transporter binding in early Parkinson's disease.
32092703|a|BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but their relationships to nigrostriatal degeneration remain largely unexplored. METHODS: We evaluated 18 NMS scores covering 5 major domains in relation to concurrent and future dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging in 344 PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression and Markers Initiative (PPMI). We standardized NMS assessments into z-scores for side-by-side comparisons. Patients underwent sequential DaTSCAN imaging at enrollment and at months 12, 24, and 48. Specific binding ratios (SBR) were calculated using the occipital lobe reference region. We evaluated the association of striatal DAT binding at the four time points with each baseline NMS using mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: Multiple baseline NMS were significantly associated with DAT binding at baseline and at follow-up scans. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) symptoms showed the strongest association - mean striatal SBR declined with increasing RBD symptom z-score (average of time-point-specific slopes per unit change in z-score: betaAVG = -0.083, SE = 0.017; p < 0.0001). In addition, striatal DAT binding was linearly associated with increasing baseline z-scores: positively for the memory (betaAVG=0.055, SE = 0.022; p = 0.01) and visuospatial (betaAVG=0.044, SE = 0.020; p = 0.03) cognitive domains, and negatively for total anxiety (betaAVG= -0.059, SE = 0.018; p = 0.001). Striatal DAT binding showed curvilinear associations with odor identification, verbal discrimination recognition, and autonomic dysfunction z-scores (p = 0.001, p = 0.0009, and p = 0.0002, respectively). Other NMS were not associated with DAT binding. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple NMS, RBD symptoms in particular, are associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic changes in early PD.

32228206|t|Acute anosmia in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
32228206|a|The cardinal features of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are optic neuritis, longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis and area postrema syndrome. Olfactory dysfunction is not listed as a feature in the NMOSD diagnostic criteria. Here, we present an aquaporin-4 antibody positive patient who, in addition to classical features of NMOSD, developed acute anosmia with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of olfactory bulb abnormalities. While the association of anosmia and NMOSD has been rarely noted previously, to our knowledge, no prior cases have found this to be one of the presenting features of a relapse nor have they identified acute radiological correlates.

33039276|t|How specific are non-motor symptoms in the prodrome of Parkinson's disease compared to other movement disorders?
33039276|a|The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on motor signs is often preceded by several non-motor symptoms that can indicate early prodromal neurodegenerative processes. Such prodromal symptoms can aid the early detection of PD, but their specificity for prodromal PD in comparison to prodromes of other movement disorders is still largely unclear. We here aim to give a first insight into the published evidence of prodromal non-motor symptoms in PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), Huntington's disease (HD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and autonomic dysfunction have been observed in the prodromes of PD, MSA, DLB and SCA. Depression and cognitive decline have been reported for prodromal PD, DLB, HD, SCA, and PSP. Olfactory loss has only been described in prodromal PD/DLB. However, estimating the specificity of prodromal non-motor symptoms in PD is so far complicated by scarce prospective evidence and study limitations. Information on marker specificity is a prerequisite for an accurate early (differential) diagnosis of prodromal diseases, as well as specific recruitment for targeted neuroprotective interventions. We here would like to raise awareness of these issues and encourage further prospective research of prodromal non-motor symptoms in neurodegenerative movement disorders and other diseases.

33459536|t|[A novel approach to differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor].
33459536|a|OBJECTIVE: To study tremor and olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), patients with essential tremor and healthy people for the differential diagnosis and to verify the hypothesis on the inverse dependence between tremor and olfactory dysfunction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Olfactory dysfunction was studied in 45 patients with PD, 40 patients with essential tremor and 64 healthy controls. Tremor was studied in 90 people, including 30 controls and 30 patients with PD and essential tremor. The olfactory function was tested with Sniffin' Sticks test. Tremor parameters were studied with wireless monitoring instrument for electrophysiological signals record, where three essential data flows have been recorded: electromyogram, gyroscope and acceleration. The instrument recorded the frequency and amplitude of each parameter. The data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistica 2.3 software using standard methods. Besides, non-linear statistics using ViDaExpert software with elastic map technique was utilized. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The elastic map perfectly separated the patients with PD and essential tremor, as well as healthy controls. Three clusters were observed. The analysis of composition of the clusters proved the better quality of olfactory function of the patients with essential tremor compared to the patients with PD. This bias confirms the hypothesis on the inverse dependence between the tremor level and olfactory dysfunction.

33487544|t|Towards subgroup-specific risk estimates: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies on olfactory dysfunction and risk of Parkinson's disease.
33487544|a|BACKGROUND: Interest has risen in identifying individuals at high risk of incident Parkinson's disease (PD) to facilitate inclusion in neuroprotective treatment trials. Current risk estimates of prodromal markers are based on aggregated data of an entire population, but this approach disregards differences in risk estimates by subgroups of a population. In this proof of concept, we determine subgroup-specific risk estimates of olfactory dysfunction for incident PD. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane were searched for prospective studies investigating the association between olfactory dysfunction and incident PD. Random-effects meta-analysis, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to investigate general and subgroup risk estimates. RESULTS: Individuals with odor identification dysfunction seemed to be at greater risk of incident PD compared to controls without olfactory dysfunction (OR = 4.18; 95%CI [2.47-7.07]). Risk estimates were higher in studies that included higher percentages of women (regression slope beta = 0.053 increase in log odds ratio per 1% increase 1%, p = 0.0006), increased with mean study age (beta = 0.21 per one year increase; p = 0.005) and in REM-sleep behavior disorder cohorts (beta = 1.95; p = 0.03). Furthermore, the association between olfactory dysfunction and incident PD was most distinct in studies with shorter follow-up duration (ss = -0.56; p = 0.0047). CONCLUSION: The presence of olfactory dysfunction conveys a considerably elevated risk of incident PD, likely more in studies with a higher proportion of women, older individuals or short follow-up duration. Individual patient data are warranted to confirm these findings and to yield subgroup-specific risk estimates of other common markers to refine prodromal PD criteria.

33755262|t|Olfaction in Neuropathologically Defined Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
33755262|a|BACKGROUND: Hyposmia is characteristic of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs), whereas progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) typically has normal sense of smell. However, there is a lack of pathologically confirmed data. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to study hyposmia in pathologically confirmed PSP patients and compare to PD patients and nondegenerative controls. METHODS: We studied autopsied subjects in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders who had antemortem olfactory testing and a neuropathological diagnosis of either PD, PSP, or control. RESULTS: This study included 281 cases. Those with neuropathologically confirmed PSP (N = 24) and controls (N = 174) had significantly better sense of smell than those with PD (N = 76). Although most PSP patients had normal olfaction, there were some with hyposmia, resulting in an overall reduced sense of smell in PSP compared to controls. The sensitivity of having PSP pathologically in those presenting with parkinsonism and normosmia was 93.4% with a specificity of 64.7%. Cases with both PSP and PD pathologically had reduced sense of smell similar to PD alone (N = 7). Hyposmic PSP patients had significantly higher Lewy body burden not meeting criteria for additional PD/DLB diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologically confirmed PD had reduced olfaction compared with PSP or controls. In the setting of parkinsonism in this sample, the presence of normosmia had high sensitivity for PSP. Hyposmia in PSP suggests the presence of additional Lewy body pathology.   2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

35166976|t|Olfactory dysfunction is associated with motor function only in tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease.
35166976|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of olfactory impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is 50-90%, and therefore, olfactory dysfunction is one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in patients with PD. Numerous studies have evaluated the association between motor and non-motor symptoms and olfactory dysfunction in PD. AIM: In this study, we investigated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction, which is measured using the UPSIT test, with other motor and non-motor symptoms separately in three motor subtypes of PD, including tremor dominant (TD), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), and indeterminate and healthy subjects. METHODS: We recruited 487 early-stage PD patients (43 PIGD, 406 TD, and 38 indeterminate) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 197) from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). All participants completed motor and non-motor tests at baseline visit and after 4 years of follow-up. Subjects underwent common PD scaling tests. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction was significantly correlated with declined motor functions only in the TD subtype. Also, significant correlations were noticed between olfactory dysfunction and speed-attention processing and executive function in the HCs as well. Finally, no significant or meaningful association was observed in the PIGD and indeterminate subtype. Anosmia and hyposmia subjects in the TD group had the worse motor and non-motor scores compared to normosmia subjects after 4 years. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction was significantly correlated with declined motor functions in the TD subtype. This is indicating that olfactory dysfunction may be an early motor and non-motor biomarker only in the TD subtype. However, it is possible that the involvement of olfactory function in other subtypes is not strong enough to make it a useful marker of diseases progression.

35180111|t|Olfaction, Cognitive Impairment, and PET Biomarkers in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
35180111|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory deficits are early features of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether olfaction is associated with PET biomarkers among community-dwelling older adults is less clear. OBJECTIVE: Investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of olfaction with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition. METHODS: We analyzed 364 initially cognitively normal participants (58% women, 24% black) who had baseline olfaction data and subsequent cognitive assessments during an average 2.4-year. A subset of 129 had PET-PiB (Abeta) (n = 72 repeated) and 105 had 18F-flortaucipir (FTP)-PET (tau) (n = 44 repeated). Olfaction was measured using a 16-item Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test. The association of olfaction with incident MCI was examined using Cox regression. Associations with PiB-distribution volume ratio (DVR) and FTP-standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were examined using partial correlation. We tested whether PiB+/-status modified these associations. Analyses were adjusted for demographics and olfactory test version. RESULTS: 17 (5%) participants developed MCI. Each unit lower odor identification score was associated with 22% higher risk of developing MCI (p = 0.04). In the PET subset, lower scores were associated with higher mean cortical DVR and DVR in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus (p<=0.04). The "olfaction*PiB+/-" interaction in OFC DVR was significant (p = 0.03), indicating the association was limited to PiB positive individuals. Greater decline in odor identification score was associated with greater increase in anterior OFC DVR and entorhinal tau SUVR (p<=0.03). CONCLUSION: Among community-dwelling older adults, poorer olfaction predicts incident MCI and is associated with overall and regional Abeta. Greater olfaction decline is associated with faster Abeta and tau accumulation in olfaction-related regions. Whether olfaction predicts AD-related neurodegenerative changes warrants further investigations.

35869271|t|Seed-induced Abeta deposition alters neuronal function and impairs olfaction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
35869271|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) which ultimately forms plaques. These Abeta deposits can be induced in APP transgenic mouse models by prion-like seeding. It has been widely accepted that anosmia and hyposmia occur during the early stages of AD, even before cognitive deficits are present. In order to determine the impact of seed-induced Abeta deposits on olfaction, we performed intracerebral injections of seed-competent brain homogenate into the olfactory bulb of young pre-depositing APP transgenic mice. Remarkably, we observed a dramatic olfactory impairment in those mice. Furthermore, the number of newborn neurons as well as the activity of cells in the mitral cell layer was decreased. Notably, exposure to an enriched environment reduced Abeta seeding, vivified neurogenesis and most importantly reversed olfactory deficits. Based on our findings, we conclude that altered neuronal function as a result of induced Abeta pathology might contribute to olfactory dysfunction in AD.

37301657|t|Impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on olfaction in Parkinson's disease: Clinical features and functional hypotheses.
37301657|a|Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical therapy typically applied in Parkinson's disease (PD). The efficacity of DBS on the control of motor symptoms in PD is well grounded while the efficacity on non-motor symptoms is more controversial, especially on olfactory disorders (ODs). The present review shows that DBS does not improve hyposmia but can affect positively identification/discrimination scores in PD. The functional hypotheses suggest complex mechanisms in terms of cerebral connectivity and neurogenesis process which could act indirectly on the olfactory bulb and olfactory pathways related to specific cognitive olfactory tasks. The functional hypotheses also suggest complex mechanisms of cholinergic neurotransmitter interactions involved in these pathways. Finally, the impact of DBS on general cognitive functions in PD could also be beneficial to identification/discrimination tasks in PD.

37805158|t|The association of serum neurofilament light chains with early symptoms related to Parkinson's disease: A cross-sectional study.
37805158|a|Neurofilament light chains (NfL), released with neural axon injury, is considered as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationship between NfL and PD has been studied mainly in diagnosed patients. Few large-scale studies analyze the association between NfL levels and multiple non-motor symptoms linked to early PD in the general population. Therefore, this study aims to determine the association of NfL with early symptoms of PD, and effectively respond to the development of early symptoms of PD. We examined the relationship between serum NfL and early non-motor symptoms of PD (smell dysfunction, sleep problems, cognitive function) and serum Klotho levels in the general population using data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The relationship between serum NfL and early symptoms of PD in 1125 participants was analyzed by multiple linear regression and logistic regression models. The results showed a significant association between serum NfL and early symptoms of PD. There was a significant positive correlation between NfL and smell dysfunction, short sleep and long sleep. There was a significant negative correlation between NfL and Klotho levels and cognitive function test results. Further, we observed gender and age differences in the association of NfL with early symptoms of PD. Our study demonstrate that elevated serum NfL levels are positively associated with an increased risk of early PD-related symptoms, suggesting that serum NfL can be a promising biomarker for early PD.

38195133|t|A review of the gastrointestinal, olfactory, and skin abnormalities in patients with Parkinson's disease.
38195133|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative motor disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The substantia nigra is neither the first nor the only brain region affected by PD. Recent and old studies have shown that PD does not only affect the CNS; in fact, autonomic innervation in the GIT, skin, and olfactory system was found to be affected by alpha-synuclein pathology outside the CNS, affecting patients' quality of life. In the gastrointestinal system, dysphagia, constipation, and bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine are common in patients with PD. In addition, several skin conditions were reported in PD, including seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, melanoma, and others. Finally, olfactory system dysfunction, such as reduced touch sensation and smell, was associated with motor abnormalities. Further high-quality studies are needed to develop reliable tests that could help in the early diagnosis of PD.

38580172|t|Potential Convergence of Olfactory Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease and COVID-19: The Role of Neuroinflammation.
38580172|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that affects 7-10 million individuals worldwide. A common early symptom of PD is olfactory dysfunction (OD), and more than 90% of PD patients suffer from OD. Recent studies have highlighted a high incidence of OD in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review investigates the potential convergence of OD in PD and COVID-19, particularly focusing on the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation contributes to OD and neurological events. Starting from our fundamental understanding of the olfactory bulb, we summarize the clinical features of OD and pathological features of the olfactory bulb from clinical cases and autopsy reports in PD patients. We then examine SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory bulb neuropathology and OD and emphasize the SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammatory cascades potentially leading to PD manifestations. By activating microglia and astrocytes, as well as facilitating the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to the onset or exacerbation of PD. We also discuss the possible contributions of NF-kappaB, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the JAK/STAT, p38 MAPK, TLR4, IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 and cGAS-STING signaling pathways. Although olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 may be reversible, it is challenging to restore OD in patients with PD. With the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and the recurrence of infections, we call for continued attention to the intersection between PD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially from the perspective of OD.

39137693|t|Human perception of Parkinson's disease body odor in comparison to the volatile organic compounds of Parkinson's disease.
39137693|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) have a distinctive body odor, which was first described by a patient's wife as musky and strong. Later analysis of sebum of patients with PD revealed four volatile organic compounds (VOC) (perillic aldehyde, hippuric acid, eicosane, octadecanal), that differed from healthy subjects, and the patient's wife confirmed that three of them smelled like patients with PD. However, it is unclear whether other people can also perceive this PD body odor and whether it can be artificially recreated. Hence, we aimed to systematically assess whether young women can perceive the PD body odor and whether they can discriminate between the PD body odor and the "artificial PD odor" composed of the four VOCs mentioned above. METHODS: T-shirts were collected from 19 people with idiopathic PD and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy participants to represent the PD body odor and the healthy body odor, respectively. The four VOCs were diluted in 1,2-propanediol to prepare the artificial PD body odor. Body odors were rated by 26 young women. RESULTS: PD body odor was perceived as more musty, strong, smelly, and unpleasant compared to healthy and artificial PD body odor. Furthermore, around 80 % of women were able to discriminate PD body odor from artificial PD body odor. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study confirmed a distinctive body odor quality of patients with PD, which can be perceived by young women. However, the four VOCs, composing the artificial PD body odor, were insufficient to reproduce the body odor from PD patients.

39179019|t|Functional connectivity differences of the olfactory network in Parkinson's Disease, mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal individuals: A resting-state fMRI study.
39179019|a|Olfactory dysfunction is an early sign of such neurodegenerative diseases as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD), and is often present in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor of AD. Understanding neuro-temporal relationships, i.e., functional connectivity, between olfactory eloquent structures in such disorders could shed light on their basic pathophysiology. To this end, we employed region-based analyses using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) obtained from cognitively normal (CN), MCI, and PD patients with cognitive impairment (PD-CogImp). Using machine learning (linear and ensemble learning), we determined whether the identified functional patterns could classify abnormal function from normal function. Olfaction, as measured by objective testing, was found to be most strongly associated with diagnostic status, emphasizing the fundamental association of this primary sensory system with these conditions. Consistently lower functional connectivity was observed in the PD-CogImp cohort compared to the CN cohort among all identified brain regions. Differences were also found between PD-CogImp and MCI at the level of the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices. MCI and CN subjects had different functional connectivity between the posterior orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus. Regardless of study group, males showed significantly higher connectivity than females in connections involving the orbitofrontal cortex. The logistic regression model trained using the top discriminatory features revealed that caudate was the most involved olfaction-related brain structure (accuracy = 0.88, Area under the Receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.90). In aggregate, our study demonstrates that resting functional connectivity among olfactory eloquent structures has potential value in better understanding the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases.

39352420|t|From small to tall: breed-varied household pet dogs can be trained to detect Parkinson's Disease.
39352420|a|Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a clinically diagnosed disease that carries a reported misdiagnosis rate of 10-20%. Recent scientific discoveries have provided evidence of volatile organic compounds in sebum that are unique to patients with PD. The primary objective of this study was to determine if companion dogs could be trained to distinguish between sebum samples provided by PD-positive patients and PD-negative human controls. This was a randomized, handler-blind, controlled study. Twenty-three canines of varying breeds, ages, and environmental backgrounds were included. The study period encompassed 200 total working days from 2021 to 2022. Factors investigated included donor gender and levodopa drug affectivity, as well as canine breed, age, and duration of training time. The findings in this study were compiled from data collected during the final two years of a seven-year research program. For this two-year reporting period, when averaged as a group, the 23 dogs were 89% sensitive and 87% specific to olfactory distinction between PD-positive and PD-negative human donor samples. Ten of the twenty-three dogs averaged 90% or higher in both sensitivity and specificity. In 161 separate trials, a dog was presented with both novel PD-positive and PD-negative samples. For these novel exposures, the dogs collectively averaged 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity. PD medication was also investigated and was found to have no discernible impact on canine sensitivity or specificity results. Study findings support the application of companion dogs, trained with force-free, reward-based methodologies, for the detection of PD-positive and PD-negative samples under controlled conditions.

785935|t|Penicillamine in multiple sclerosis. Therapeutic trial and design of uncontrolled pilot drug study.
785935|a|Twenty-three patients with the chronic progressive or intermittent relapsing form of multiple sclerosis (MS) were treated with d-penicillamine over a period from 6 weeks to 12 months. Clinical effect was evaluated using Kurtzke's disability status scale with follow-up lasting from 7 weeks to 15 months. Fifteen patients remained unchanged, 7 became worse and 1 improved after the treatment. Administration of penicillamine to patients with MS resulted in an insignificant lowering of serum IgA, IgG and IgM levels. It is concluded that penicillamine neither prevented the occurrence of relapses nor slowed down the chronic progressive course of multiple sclerosis.

1504133|t|Serotonin response in sweet-food craving Alzheimer's disease subjects.
1504133|a|Abnormal sweet-food craving may occur in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. This behavior may be due to abnormalities in the brain serotonin system. Fenfluramine stimulates the brain serotonin neurosystem, producing an increase in systemic prolactin. Using the fenfluramine stimulation test, brain serotonin system response was evaluated in 12 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease. The subjects' caregivers completed questionnaires concerning subject food preferences and behaviors. Alzheimer's disease subjects with sweet-food craving were found to have a significantly higher response to fenfluramine than non sweet-food craving subjects. This preliminary study is limited by small sample size. Allowing for assumptions concerning central nervous system regulatory processes, the data suggest a possible role for the serotonin system in sweet-food craving in Alzheimer's disease.

1538221|t|Bilateral olfactory dysfunction in early stage treated and untreated idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
1538221|a|Decreased olfactory function is among the first signs of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether such dysfunction is present to the same degree on both sides of the nose, however, is unknown. Furthermore, whether the deficit results from or is influenced by anti-Parkinsonian medications has not been definitely established. Odour identification ability was evaluated on the left and right sides of the nose in 20 early-stage untreated PD patients, 20 early-stage treated PD patients, and 20 controls. In all cases, the PD related olfactory dysfunction was bilateral and no difference was observed between the test scores of patients taking or not taking drugs for PD. Although asymmetries of unsystematic direction were present in the test scores of some PD patients, similar asymmetries were observed in the controls and the asymmetries were not related to the side of the major motor dysfunction. As in earlier work, no relation was present between the olfactory test scores and the degree of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, or gait disturbance at the time of testing. These findings indicate that the olfactory dysfunction of early stage PD is robust, typically of the same general magnitude on both sides of the nose, and uninfluenced by anti-Parkinsonian medications.

1852411|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
1852411|a|An olfactory function test in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 10 age-matched control subjects was performed. Both detection and recognition thresholds were measured with five kinds of synthesized odorants (T & T olfactometry). Before each test, rhinoscopic inspections were performed to exclude subjects who could have respiratory hyposmia. Both detection and recognition thresholds in patients with PD were significantly elevated in comparison with those of control subjects. Auditory acuity of PD patients, however, was well preserved and there was no significant correlation between auditory and olfactory threshold. On the basis of the present study, the authors conclude that olfactory dysfunction is one of the characteristic symptoms of PD and it may be attributed to lesions in the olfactory neural pathway including olfactory neuroepithelium.

7834953|t|[A case of unilateral gustatory disturbance produced by the contralateral midbrain lesion].
7834953|a|We reported a case of unilateral gustatory disturbance produced by a lesion in the contralateral midbrain. A 37-year-old man first noticed dysesthesia in the left side of his face. Later, the patient developed dysesthesia of the left part of the lip, muscular weakness on the left lower extremity and gustatory disturbance on the left side. MR scan disclosed a lesion in the tegmentum of the right midbrain, which showed low intensity on a T1-weighted image and high intensity on a T2-weighted image. This lesion could be due to multiple sclerosis. This case suggests that the unilateral gustatory information ascends via the contralateral pathway at the midbrain level. It is suggested that the central gustatory pathways above the ipsilateral pontine taste are ascend via the contralateral projections to the thalamic taste area (parvicellular portion of the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus, VPMpc).

7872154|t|Early cognitive changes and nondementing behavioral abnormalities in Parkinson's disease.
7872154|a|Early cognitive changes in patients with PD are often subtle and influenced by factors that interact with the disease process, including age and age of disease onset, medication, and the specific constellation of motor symptoms. These factors notwithstanding, there is ample evidence that specific cognitive changes occur early in the course of PD. Whereas language processing deficits are infrequent, subtle changes in olfaction and contrast sensitivity have been repeatedly observed. Executive function deficits are often prominent and, as an integral part of many tasks, also influence performance on a wide range of cognitive measures. This is particularly true for memory and visuospatial dysfunction, two areas that rely heavily on executive demands. Finally, depressive symptoms are also frequent in the early stages of the disease. The significance of early behavioral changes and their prognostic implications are largely unknown and need to be assessed prospectively.

8492953|t|Olfactory testing differentiates between progressive supranuclear palsy and idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
8492953|a|Olfactory dysfunction occurs in most patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we sought to determine whether such dysfunction is also present in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a condition which shares a number of motor symptoms with PD and is commonly misdiagnosed as PD. We administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, a standardized test of odor identification ability, to 21 PSP patients; 17 also received a forced-choice odor detection threshold test. We compared the olfactory test scores to those obtained from PD patients and normal controls matched to the PSP patients on the basis of age, sex, and smoking habits. Overall, the olfactory function of the PSP patients was markedly superior to that of the PD patients and did not differ significantly from that of the normal controls. There was no association in either the PSP or PD patient groups between (1) the olfactory test scores and (2) measures of motor symptom severity, disease stage, and medication usage. These findings demonstrate that patients with PSP and PD differ markedly in their ability to smell and suggest that olfactory testing may be useful in their differential diagnosis.

8928642|t|Innervation in human taste buds and its decrease in Alzheimer's disease patients.
8928642|a|The innervation in human taste buds of the foliate and circumvallate papillae was studied immunohistochemically using several neuronal markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their control (ADC) patients. Antisera to protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta hydroxylase (DbetaH) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were used in immunofluorescence and streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex studies. The antiserum to PGP 9.5 stained a greater number of intragemmal nerve fibers in taste buds than that of other antisera. PGP 9.5 immunoreactivity was strictly localized in the nerve fibers, whereas NSE immunoreactivity was observed not only in the nerve fibers, but also in taste bud cells. Intragemmal TH- and DbetaH-immunoreactive nerve fibers were not identified in taste buds. Only a few intragemmal nerve fibers immunoreactive for anti-CGRP antiserum were observe in a small number of taste buds. Furthermore, quantitive analysis in AD and ADC patients demonstrated that the mean number of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive intragemmal nerve fibers in taste buds of the foliate and circumvallate papillae decreased significantly in AD patients. These results indicated that PGP 9.5 is a most suitable molecular marker for the demonstration of the extrinsic innervation in human taste buds, and that the decreased innervation may account partially for the decrement in chemosensory capacity in AD patients.

9371905|t|Olfactory dysfunction in familial parkinsonism.
9371905|a|Impaired olfactory function is commonly observed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). However, it is unknown whether it is also found in familial parkinsonism. To address this issue we administered a smell test to 12 affected, three monosymptomatic, and 12 at-risk individuals from six large parkinsonian kindreds. Three kindreds exhibited an IPD phenotype and three exhibited a parkinsonism-plus syndrome (PPS) phenotype. All but one of the affected individuals had impaired olfactory function. In contrast, only five of the 12 at-risk individuals had impaired olfactory function. The degree of olfactory impairment in the at-risk individuals was less severe than in the affected individuals. The difference in the degree of olfactory impairment in individuals exhibiting the IPD and the PPS phenotypes was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that olfactory dysfunction is a phenotypic characteristic of familial parkinsonism and that it is independent of the kindred phenotype. The appearance of olfactory dysfunction soon after disease onset raises the possibility that it is part of the neurodegenerative disease process.

10372649|t|Treatment with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields improves olfactory function in Parkinson's disease.
10372649|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). It may manifest in the early stages of the disease and infrequently may even antedate the onset of motor symptoms. The cause of olfactory dysfunction in PD remains unknown. Pathological changes characteristic of PD (i.e., Lewy bodies) have been demonstrated in the olfactory bulb which contains a large population of dopaminergic neurons involved in olfactory information processing. Since dopaminergic drugs do not affect olfactory threshold in PD patients, it has been suggested that olfactory dysfunction in these patients is not dependent on dopamine deficiency. I present two fully medicated Parkinsonian patients with long standing history of olfactory dysfunction in whom recovery of smell occurred during therapeutic transcranial application of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla flux density. In both patients improvement of smell during administration of EMFs occurred in conjunction with recurrent episodes of yawning. The temporal association between recovery of smell and yawning behavior is remarkable since yawning is mediated by activation of a subpopulation of striatal and limbic postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors induced by increased synaptic dopamine release. A high density of dopamine D2 receptors is present in the olfactory bulb and tract. Degeneration of olfactory dopaminergic neurons may lead to upregulation (i.e., supersensitivity) of postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors. Presumably, small amounts of dopamine released into the synapses of the olfactory bulb during magnetic stimulation may cause activation of these supersensitive receptors resulting in enhanced sense of smell. Interestingly, in both patients enhancement of smell perception occurred only during administration of EMFs of 7 Hz frequency implying that the release of dopamine and activation of dopamine D2 receptors in the olfactory bulb was partly frequency dependent. In fact, weak magnetic fields have been found to cause interaction with biological systems only within narrow frequency ranges (i.e., frequency windows) and the existence of such frequency ranges has been explained on the basis of the cyclotron resonance model.

11453220|t|Olfactory sensitivity in early-stage Parkinson patients affected by more marked unilateral disorder.
11453220|a|Two groups of subjects, 6 medicated Parkinson patients at an early stage of disease and affected by more marked right unilateral disorder and 12 normal elderly people, were examined on matching and naming olfactory tasks. On the former, subjects had to recognize among four previously sniffed odours, while on the latter they had to label an odour by choosing among four alternatives proposed by the examiner. Stimuli were administered to both nostrils. Analysis indicated that Parkinson patients were less efficient with the left nostril in the matching task, supporting the hypothesis of a larger compromise in the nostril contralateral to the side of the body more affected by the disease. Such a difference was not observed for the elderly people. Data are discussed with reference to the loss of dopamine in Parkinson patients.

11811747|t|The physiology, medical management and oral implications of menopause.
11811747|a|BACKGROUND: Approximately 36 million women in the United States are in the postmenopausal phase of life. The vast majority of these women experienced spontaneous cessation of menses between the ages of 47 and 55 years when the production of estrogen decreased because of an inadequate number of functioning follicles within their ovaries. Fewer women entered menopause after surgical removal of both ovaries. This procedure usually is performed prophylactically to prevent ovarian cancer in conjunction with a hysterectomy, which is required to treat abnormal bleeding, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. The physiological changes associated with spontaneous or surgical menopause cause some women to experience uncomfortable symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. In addition, estrogen deprivation arising from menopause in association with age-related factors disproportionately increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (that is, myocardial infarct, stroke), osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease and oral disease. Hormone replacement therapy, or HRT (estrogen or estrogen and progestin), often is prescribed on a short-term basis to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency and on a long-term basis to prevent some of the chronic illnesses common to postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Dentists who treat women entering menopause need to consider the stressful phase of life their patients are experiencing. Clinical findings of postmenopausal problems on dental examination may include a paucity of saliva, increased dental caries, dysesthesia, taste alterations, atrophic gingivitis, periodontitis and osteoporotic jaws unsuitable for conventional prosthetic devices or dental implants. Panoramic dental radiographs may reveal calcified carotid artery atheromas. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists have an opportunity to refer women who are not under the care of a gynecologist for an evaluation to determine the appropriateness of HRT for its systemic and oral health benefits.

12390970|t|Clinical correlates of selective pathology in the amygdala of patients with Parkinson's disease.
12390970|a|The amygdala exhibits significant pathological changes in Parkinson's disease, including atrophy and Lewy body (LB) formation. Amygdala pathology has been suggested to contribute to some clinical features of Parkinson's disease, including deficits of olfaction and facial expression. The degree of neuronal loss in amygdala subnuclei and the relationship with LB formation in non-demented Parkinson's disease cases have not been examined previously. Using stereological methods, the volume of neurones and the number of neurones in amygdala subdivisions were estimated in 18 prospectively studied, non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and 16 age- and sex-matched controls. Careful exclusion (all cortical disease) and inclusion (non-demented, levodopa-responsive, idiopathic Parkinson's disease or controls) criteria were applied. Seven Parkinson's disease cases experienced well-formed visual hallucinations many years after disease onset, while nine Parkinson's disease cases and three controls were treated for depression. Anatomically, the amygdala was subdivided into the lateral nucleus, the basal (basolateral and basomedial) nuclei and the corticomedial (central, medial and cortical nuclei) complex. LB and Lewy neurites were identified by immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin and were assessed semiquantitatively. LB were found throughout the amygdala in Parkinson's disease, being present in approximately 4% of neurones. Total amygdala volume was reduced by 20% in Parkinson's disease (P = 0.02) and LB concentrated in the cortical and basolateral nuclei. Lewy neurites were present in most cases but did not correlate with any structural or functional variable. Amygdala volume loss was largely due to a 30% reduction in volume (P = 0.01) and the total estimated number of neurones (P = 0.007) in the corticomedial complex. The degree of neurone loss and the proportion of LB-containing neurones in the cortical nucleus within this complex were constant across Parkinson's disease cases and neither variable was related to disease duration (R(2 )< 0.03; P > 0.5). The cortical nucleus has major olfactory connections and its degeneration is likely to contribute to the early selective anosmia common in Parkinson's disease. There was a small reduction in neuronal density in the basolateral nucleus in all Parkinson's disease cases, but no consistent volume or cell loss within this region. However, the proportion of LB-containing neurones in the basolateral nucleus was nearly doubled in cases that exhibited visual hallucinations, suggesting that neuronal dysfunction in this nucleus contributes to this late clinical feature. Detailed quantitation of the other amygdala subdivisions failed to reveal any other substantial anomalies or any associations with depression. Thus, the impact of Parkinson's disease on the amygdala is highly selective and correlates with both early and late clinical features.

12619779|t|Early olfactory involvement in Alzheimer's disease.
12619779|a|BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) the olfactory system, including the olfactory bulb, a limbic paleocortex is severely damaged. The occurrence of early olfactory deficits and the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in olfactory bulb were reported previously by a few authors. The goal of the present study was to analyze the occurrence of AD-type degenerative changes in the peripheral part of the olfactory system and to answer the question whether the frequency and severity of changes in the olfactory bulb and tract are associated with those of the cerebral cortex in AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 110 autopsy cases several cortical areas and the olfactory bulb and tract were analyzed using histo- and immunohistochemical techniques. Based on a semiquantitative analysis of cortical senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and curly fibers, the 110 cases were divided into four groups: 19 cases with severe (definite AD), 14 cases with moderate, 58 cases with discrete and 19 control cases without AD-type cortical changes. RESULTS: The number of cases with olfactory involvement was very high, more than 84% in the three groups with cortical AD-type lesions. Degenerative olfactory changes were present in all 19 definite AD cases, and in two of the 19 controls. The statistical analysis showed a significant association between the peripheral olfactory and cortical degenerative changes with respect to their frequency and severity (P < 0.001). Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads appear in the olfactory system as early as in entorhinal cortex. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a close relationship between the olfactory and cortical degenerative changes and indicate that the involvement of the olfactory bulb and tract is one of the earliest events in the degenerative process of the central nervous system in AD.

15253846|t|A controlled trial of aromatherapy for agitation in nursing home patients with dementia.
15253846|a|OBJECTIVES: Two controlled trials of aromatherapy to decrease agitation in persons with dementia have recently produced promising results. However, both studies combined the use of essential oils with massage. Thus, it is unclear if the effect of the aromatherapy intervention was the result of smelling or the cutaneous absorption of the oils. The purpose of this study was to determine whether smelling lavender oil decreases the frequency of agitated behaviors in patients with dementia. DESIGN: The study design was within-subjects ABCBA (A = lavender oil, B = thyme oil, C = unscented grapeseed oil): 4 weeks of baseline measurement, 2 weeks for each of the five treatment conditions (10-week total intervention time), and 2 weeks of postintervention measurement. Oil was placed every 3 hours on an absorbent fabric sachet pinned near the collarbone of each participant's shirt. SETTING: A long-term care facility specifically for persons with dementia. PARTICIPANTS: Seven agitated nursing home residents with advanced dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Agitation was assessed every 2 days using a modified Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. Olfactory functioning was assessed with structured olfactory identification and discrimination tasks, and with qualitative behavioral observation during those tasks. RESULTS: Split-middle analyses conducted separately for each patient revealed no treatment effects specific to lavender, no treatment effects nonspecific to pleasant smelling substances, and no treatment effects dependent on order of treatment administration. There were no differences between participants with more and less intact olfactory abilities. CONCLUSION: There is significant evidence in the neurologic and neuropsychologic literature that persons with dementia have impaired olfactory abilities. Concordant with this literature, this study found no support for the use of a purely olfactory form of aromatherapy to decrease agitation in severely demented patients. Cutaneous application of the essential oil may be necessary to achieve the effects reported in previous controlled studies.

15293269|t|Idiopathic hyposmia as a preclinical sign of Parkinson's disease.
15293269|a|Olfactory dysfunction is an early and common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). In an effort to determine whether otherwise unexplained (idiopathic) olfactory dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of developing PD, we designed a prospective study in a cohort of 361 asymptomatic relatives (parents, siblings, or children) of PD patients. A combination of olfactory detection, identification, and discrimination tasks was used to select groups of hyposmic (n = 40) and normosmic (n = 38) individuals for a 2-year clinical follow-up evaluation and sequential single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), using [123I]beta-CIT as a dopamine transporter ligand, to assess nigrostriatal dopaminergic function at baseline and 2 years from baseline. A validated questionnaire, sensitive to the presence of parkinsonism, was used in the follow-up of the remaining 283 relatives. Two years from baseline, 10% of the individuals with idiopathic hyposmia, who also had strongly reduced [123I]beta-CIT binding at baseline, had developed clinical PD as opposed to none of the other relatives in the cohort. In the remaining nonparkinsonian hyposmic relatives, the average rate of decline in dopamine transporter binding was significantly higher than in the normosmic relatives. These results indicate that idiopathic olfactory dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of developing PD of at least 10%.

15465396|t|Smell testing is abnormal in 'lubag' or X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism: a pilot study.
15465396|a|We administered a culturally corrected University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (ccUPSIT) consisting of 25 odor items to 20 patients with 'Lubag' or X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism and 20 control subjects matched by sex, age, educational background, smoking history, and geographical origin. The mean ccUPSIT score of Lubag patients (18 +/- 3.19) was statistically lower (P = 0.003) than controls (20.5 +/- 3.02). The smell scores did not correlate with phenotype, severity of dystonia, or duration of disease. Nine of 20 Lubag patients (45%) had ccUPSIT scores below the mean, with the lowest score being 11. This pilot study suggests that olfactory dysfunction may occur in Lubag patients.

15607993|t|Taste responses in patients with Parkinson's disease.
15607993|a|OBJECTIVE: Preclinical studies indicate that dopaminergic transmission in the basal ganglia may be involved in processing of both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. Given this, the aim of the present study was to assess taste responses to sweet, bitter, sour, and salty substances in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Rated intensity and pleasantness of filter paper discs soaked in sucrose (10-60%), quinine (0.025-0.5%), citric acid (0.25-4.0%), or sodium chloride (1.25-20%) solutions was evaluated in 30 patients with PD and in 33 healthy controls. Paper discs soaked in deionised water served as control stimuli. In addition, reactivity to 100 ml samples of chocolate and vanilla milk was assessed in both groups. Taste detection thresholds were assessed by means of electrogustometry. Sociodemographic and neuropsychiatric data, including cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, tea and coffee drinking, depressive symptoms, and cognitive functioning were collected. RESULTS: In general, perceived intensity, pleasantness, and identification of the sucrose, quinine, citric acid, or sodium chloride samples did not differ between the PD patients and controls. Intensity ratings of the filter papers soaked in 0.025% quinine were significantly higher in the PD patients compared with the control group. No inter-group differences were found in taste responses to chocolate and vanilla milk. Electrogustometric thresholds were significantly (p = 0.001) more sensitive in the PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: PD is not associated with any major alterations in responses to pleasant or unpleasant taste stimuli. Patients with PD may present enhanced taste acuity in terms of electrogustometric threshold.

17027774|t|Olfactory deficit in idiopathic rapid eye movements sleep behavior disorder.
17027774|a|INTRODUCTION: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by a loss of atonia and an increased phasic muscle activity during REM sleep. Idiopathic RBD frequently herald an alpha-synucleinopathy, including such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy Body (DLB). Pathological changes in the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory loss occur very early in the course of PD and DLB. The aim of the study was to assess olfactory function in a large group of idiopathic RBD patients. METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive polysomnographically-confirmed iRBD patients (44 men, 10 women; mean age: 69.2+/-8.3 years; mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III) score: 4.9+/-4.3) and 54 age and gender-matched control subjects underwent the Brief University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (B-SIT). RESULTS: A marked olfactory impairment was observed in the RBD group (mean B-SIT score: 7.1+/-2.5 versus 9.4+/-1.8; p < 0.0001), with 33 (61.1%) RBD patients versus 9 (16.6%) controls showing abnormal olfactory function (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the degree of olfactory loss and either duration of RBD symptoms or UPDRS-III score. Deficit in recognize paint thinner odorant showed the highest positive predictive value (0.95) for identifying idiopathic RBD. CONCLUSIONS: The olfactory deficit found in most idiopathic RBD patients shares similarities with that described in PD and may be a sign of a widespread neurodegenerative process. Its detection may help in identifying subjects at higher risk of developing an alpha-synucleinopathy-mediated neurodegeneration.

17164076|t|Impairment of odor recognition in Parkinson's disease caused by weak activations of the orbitofrontal cortex.
17164076|a|Olfactory dysfunction and abnormalities of olfactory brain structures are found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and a number of studies have reported that olfactory dysfunction is caused by abnormalities of the central olfactory systems. We previously analyzed electroencephalograms (EEGs) and respiration simultaneously in normal subjects while testing for detection and recognition of odors. We identified changes in respiration pattern in response to odor stimuli and found inspiratory phase-locked alpha oscillations (I-alpha). The genesis of I-alpha were identified in olfactory-related areas including the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdale and orbitofrontal cortex with an EEG dipole tracing method. In the present study, we used the same protocol in PD patients and compared results of PD with those of age-matched controls. All PD patients detected odor, but 5 out of 10 showed impaired odor recognition. Changes in breathing pattern associated with emotional changes during exposure to odor stimuli were not observed in PD patients. I-alpha waveforms were not observed; however, positive waves followed by negative waves were identified approximately 100ms after inspiration onset. Dipoles of this component were localized in the entorhinal cortex for odor detection in all patients and in the entorhinal cortex and middle temporal gyrus for PD patients who could discriminate odors. Odor recognition in PD could be subserved by a different neural circuit from that of normal subjects, done through the temporal association cortex as a subsystem for recognizing the odor; however, the system may not be associated with the odor-induced emotions.

18972547|t|Odor identification test as an indicator of idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.
18972547|a|Reduction of olfactory function in idiopathic rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is of the same magnitude as that found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We assessed olfactory function using the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) in 48 Japanese patients with iRBD, 21 with PD, and 34 with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Possible score of the OSIT-J ranges from 0 to 12. OSIT-J scores were 4.9 +/- 2.8 in patients with iRBD, 4.8 +/- 2.8 in patients with PD, and 9.9 +/- 1.4 in OSAS patients. An OSIT-J score of 8.5 was associated with a sensitivity of 88.2 and 85.3%, respectively, and specificity of 83.3 and 85.7%, respectively, in differentiating iRBD or PD patients from OSAS patients. Odor identification is impaired in Japanese patients with iRBD and PD. The results suggest that OSIT-J, which is a short and simple nonlexical olfactory identification test, can be useful as a clinical indicator for iRBD with Lewy body formation and is appropriate in the Japanese elderly population.

19656505|t|Flavour processing in semantic dementia.
19656505|a|The cognitive mechanisms for the analysis of flavour information remain poorly understood. Patients with semantic dementia (SD) could potentially provide a window on these mechanisms; however, while abnormal eating behaviour and altered food preferences are common in SD, flavour processing has been little studied in this disorder. Here we undertook a detailed investigation of flavour processing in three patients at different stages of SD. One patient with a clinical syndrome of logopenic aphasia (LPA) was studied as a disease control, and six healthy control subjects also participated. Olfaction was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and processing of flavours was assessed using a novel battery to assess flavour perception, flavour identification, and congruence and affective valence of flavour combinations. Patients with SD performed equivalently to healthy controls on the perceptual subtest, while their ability to identify flavours or to determine congruence of flavour combinations was impaired. Classification of flavours according to affective valence was comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, the patient with LPA exhibited a perceptual deficit with relatively preserved identification of flavours, but impaired ability to determine flavour congruence, which did not benefit from affective valence. Olfactory and flavour identification performance was correlated in both patients and controls. We propose that SD produces a true deficit of flavour knowledge (an associative agnosia), while other peri-Sylvian pathologies may lead to deficient flavour perception. Our findings are consistent with emerging evidence from healthy subjects for a cortical hierarchy for processing flavour information, instantiated in a brain network that includes the insula, anterior temporal lobes and orbitofrontal cortex. The findings suggest a potential mechanism for the development of food fads and other abnormal eating behaviours.

19753620|t|Retronasal olfactory function in Parkinson's disease.
19753620|a|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Orthonasal olfaction is severely altered in PD patients. Retronasal olfactory function has been shown to be preserved under certain conditions even in the absence of orthonasal function. This study was undertaken to investigate retronasal versus orthonasal olfactory function in Parkinson's disease (PD). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: A total of 45 PD patients (mean age, 61 years; range 26-82 years) underwent orthonasal olfactory testing with a standardized olfactory test (Sniffin' Sticks) and retronasal olfactory testing with a 10-item identification kit based on aromatized powders. RESULTS: Regarding orthonasal tests, all PD patients scored within the range of hyposmia and functional anosmia. The mean correct orthonasal identification score for PD patients was 56% +/- 2.6%, and the mean retronasal identification rate was 60% +/- 3%. There was no significant difference between ortho- and retronasal odor identification (P = .15). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that retronasal and orthonasal olfactory function are severely impaired in PD patients, and this impairment is of similar magnitude for both functions. The contribution of this finding to the food-intake behavior of PD patients is discussed.

20092558|t|Genetic reductions of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 and amyloid-beta ameliorate impairment of conditioned taste aversion memory in 5XFAD Alzheimer's disease model mice.
20092558|a|Although transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) recapitulate amyloid-beta (Abeta)-related pathologies and cognitive impairments, previous studies have mainly evaluated their hippocampus-dependent memory dysfunctions using behavioral tasks such as the water maze and fear conditioning. However, multiple memory systems become impaired in AD as the disease progresses and it is important to test whether other forms of memory are affected in AD models. This study was designed to use conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and contextual fear conditioning paradigms to compare the phenotypes of hippocampus-independent and -dependent memory functions, respectively, in 5XFAD amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 transgenic mice that harbor five familial AD mutations. Although both types of memory were significantly impaired in 5XFAD mice, the onset of CTA memory deficits ( approximately 9 months of age) was delayed compared with that of contextual memory deficits ( approximately 6 months of age). Furthermore, 5XFAD mice that were genetically engineered to have reduced levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (BACE1(+/-).5XFAD) exhibited improved CTA memory, which was equivalent to the performance of wild-type controls. Importantly, elevated levels of cerebral beta-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99) and Abeta peptides in 5XFAD mice were significantly reduced in BACE1(+/-).5XFAD mice. Furthermore, Abeta deposition in the insular cortex and basolateral amygdala, two brain regions that are critically involved in CTA performance, was also reduced in BACE1(+/-).5XFAD compared with 5XFAD mice. Our findings indicate that the CTA paradigm is useful for evaluating a hippocampus-independent form of memory defect in AD model mice, which is sensitive to rescue by partial reductions of the beta-secretase BACE1 and consequently of cerebral Abeta.

20128670|a|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is an association that has been well documented in the medical literature, although the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. In the Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program, subjects were tested for olfactory function. Olfaction was impaired in subjects with clinically probable PD but not those with essential tremor (ET), restless legs syndrome (RLS), or mild cognitive impairment. In the elderly control population there were no differences between genders and the UPSIT score decreased by 3.2 points per decade. These data confirm previous findings in PD, ET, and RLS, and expand the data for an elderly control population.

20128674|t|The relationship between anosmia, constipation, and orthostasis and Parkinson's disease duration: results of a pilot study.
20128674|a|Autonomic symptomatology is prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and impacts quality of life, yet little data exist on the presentation of autonomic dysregulation. This study measures orthostasis, constipation, and anosmia in 58 PD patients and 51 age-matched controls enrolled in the University of Florida's Movement Disorders Center. Patients had their blood pressure measured while seated and in standing position, performed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), and completed a constipation survey. Our PD patients had a significantly different average decrease in systolic BP from a seated to standing position compared with their age-matched controls (5.90 mmHg (SD 17.03) vs. 2.6 mmHg (SD 11.28); p = .05). The difference in heart rate from seated to standing positions was not significant. Reflexive tachycardia was inversely proportional to levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) score (p = .002). Anosmia occurred in 96.4% of the PD group and 49% of the controls (p < .001). Constipation was also more prevalent in the PD population than in the controls (67.3% vs. 21.6%; p < .001). Both anosmia and constipation were correlated with disease duration (p = .038 and .04 respectively). Our study suggests that increasing levels of dopaminergic therapy inhibits reflexive tachycardia. Furthermore, our study suggests that anosmia and constipation progress with the primary disease process.

20209627|t|Hyposmia in progressive supranuclear palsy.
20209627|a|Previous studies suggested that olfaction is normal in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We applied the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) to 36 patients with PSP who scored more than 18 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), 140 patients with nondemented Parkinson's disease (PD) and 126 controls. Mean UPSIT scores in PSP were lower than in controls (P < 0.001) but higher than in PD (P < 0.001) after adjusting for age, gender, and smoking history. For patients with PSP, UPSIT scores correlated with MMSE (r = 0.44, P = 0.006) but not disease duration (P = 0.6), motor subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (P = 0.2), or Frontal Assessment Battery (P = 0.5). The brains of six of the patients with PSP were examined postmortem and all revealed neurofibrillary tangles and tau accumulation in the rhinencephalon, although only three had hyposmia. Further prospective studies including patients with early PSP and PSP-P with postmortem confirmation might help clarify if smell tests could be useful when the differential diagnosis lies between PD and PSP.

20217380|t|Respiratory response toward olfactory stimuli might be an index for odor-induced emotion and recognition.
20217380|a|Olfaction is a unique sensory modality. Odor molecules reach olfactory receptors by inspiration, and odor information projects directly to limbic structures not through the thalamus. Odor stimuli thus induce respiratory changes, and simultaneously induce emotion and memory recognition via stimulation of olfactory-related limbic structures. We review the relations between respiration and olfaction, and between brain rhythm and respiration from our studies in normal subjects and in patients with Parkinson's disease who had been reported to have olfactory impairment.

The goal of this study was to determine whether the severity of olfactory impairment is associated with subsequent risk of developing complications of PD. One hundred patients with PD self-administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Testing was done, on average, 3.6 years from the time of initial diagnosis. The incidence of neuropsychiatric features of PD, including cognitive decline and visual hallucinations, was ascertained through chart review after an average of 6.8 years of follow-up. Incidence of motor outcomes including falls and dyskinesias was also obtained. There was a significant trend for increased risk of neuropsychiatric complications across declining quartiles of olfactory test scores. In addition, subjects in the lowest quartile of olfactory performance had a significantly higher adjusted risk of hallucinations (HR = 4.70, 95% CI 1.64, 13.42) and cognitive decline (HR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.05, 9.21) than those in the reference quartile. There was no association between olfactory dysfunction and dyskinesias, and a very modest association with risk of falls. These findings suggest that severity of olfactory impairment early in the disease course may be a useful marker for the risk of neuropsychiatric complications of PD.

21205674|t|Olfaction in Parkin heterozygotes and compound heterozygotes: the CORE-PD study.
21205674|a|BACKGROUND: While Parkinson disease (PD) is consistently associated with impaired olfaction, one study reported better olfaction among Parkin mutation carriers than noncarriers. Whether olfaction differs between Parkin mutation heterozygotes and carriers of 2 Parkin mutations (compound heterozygotes) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between Parkin genotype and olfaction in PD probands and their unaffected relatives. METHODS: We administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) to 44 probands in the Consortium on Risk for Early-Onset Parkinson Disease study with PD onset <=50 years (10 Parkin mutation heterozygotes, 9 compound heterozygotes, 25 noncarriers) and 80 of their family members (18 heterozygotes, 2 compound heterozygotes, 60 noncarriers). In the probands, linear regression was used to assess the association between UPSIT score (outcome) and Parkin genotype (predictor), adjusting for covariates. Among family members without PD, we compared UPSIT performance in heterozygotes vs noncarriers using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for family membership, age, gender, and smoking. RESULTS: Among probands with PD, compound heterozygotes had higher UPSIT scores (31.9) than heterozygotes (20.1) or noncarriers (19.9) (p < 0.001). These differences persisted after adjustment for age, gender, disease duration, and smoking. Among relatives without PD, UPSIT performance was similar in heterozygotes (32.5) vs noncarriers (32.4), and better than in heterozygotes with PD (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Olfaction is significantly reduced among Parkin mutation heterozygotes with PD but not among their heterozygous relatives without PD. Compound heterozygotes with PD have olfaction within the normal range. Further research is required to assess whether these findings reflect different neuropathology in Parkin mutation heterozygotes and compound heterozygotes.

21846992|t|Correlation between progressive changes in piriform cortex and olfactory performance in early Parkinson's disease.
21846992|a|OBJECTIVES: The mechanism underlying olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between sequential changes of volume change of cortex associated with olfactory function and degree of deficiency of olfactory performance in PD. METHODS: Based on the arbitrary cut-off score of olfactory performance measured by 'five odors olfactory detection arrays', subjects were classified into three groups: PD patients with olfactory impairment (OPD, n = 12), PD without olfactory impairment (NPD, n = 14), and healthy controls without olfactory impairment (NC, n = 26). A morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance images (voxel-based morphometry; VBM) was used to investigate cortical volume change. RESULTS: The scores of olfactory performance were higher in both NPD and OPD groups than in the NC group independent of age and disease duration, indicating that NPD subjects did have board line deficiency of olfaction though not meet the cut-off score for abnormal olfactory function. Both NPD and OPD had cortical atrophy in the parahippocampal gyrus (PCG), but only OPD also had change in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Correlation analysis revealed that decrement of volumes of PCG and right OFC was associated with decreased olfactory detection sensitivity, and the right OFC was also correlated to olfactory identification. However, no correlation was found between structural changes and the severity of the disease measured by UPDRS score. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed that atrophy in piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex is associated with olfactory dysfunction in early PD. Atrophy of the orbitofrontal cortex becomes significant as olfactory damage progresses. Volume measurement of olfaction-associated areas together with the assessment of olfactory function may be a sensitive indicator for the early diagnosis of PD.

22674288|t|Olfactory dysfunctions in neurodegenerative disorders.
22674288|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom in the patients with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, studies of olfactory dysfunction have focused on its potential as a medication-independent biomarker for disease progression and as an early indicator for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. In the past decades, great achievements have been obtained in elucidating the neuroanatomy and the function of olfactory system, yet the pathogenesis of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders remains elusive. The neuropathologic changes of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases may involve the olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb, primary olfactory cortices, and their secondary targets changes. This article summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on pathophysiological changes of the olfactory system in neurodegenerative disorders and attempts to find the association between olfactory dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders.

23257936|t|Olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis: evidence of a decrease in different aspects of olfactory function.
23257936|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Numerous authors have described olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) in recent years. The aim of this study was to specify the aspects of olfactory perception that are most affected and to identify any correlations with clinical, anatomical and functional data. METHODS: 50 patients with remitting or secondary progressive MS were included. Personal data were collected (medical history, characteristics of their disease, depression and disability scores and number of lesions on cerebral imaging). An olfactory test (Sniffin Sticks ) was used to evaluate subjects' olfactory function. RESULTS: The odor detection threshold is the most sensitive marker, with 40% of patients presenting hyposmia. The ability to identify odors is affected later on, and is inversely correlated with the level of disability. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that several aspects of olfactory function are altered in MS, particularly those aspects requiring greater cognitive involvement, such as discrimination and identification of odors.

23450985|t|Olfactory dysfunction: common in later life and early warning of neurodegenerative disease.
23450985|a|BACKGROUND: Disturbances of smell and taste are common. About 5% of the general population have anosmia (absence of the sense of smell). Olfactory dysfunction can markedly impair the quality of life. METHODS: Review of pertinent literature retrieved by a selective search. RESULTS: In recent years, simple and reliable tests of the sense of smell have been introduced in otorhinolaryngology. Olfactory testing has become a new focus of attention in neurology as well, mainly because many patients with neurodegenerative diseases-including the majority of those with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease-have olfactory loss early on in the course of their disorder. Olfactory dysfunction is thus regarded as an early sign of neurodegenerative disease that may allow a tentative diagnosis to be made years before the motor or cognitive disturbances become evident. As for the treatment of olfactory loss, anti-inflammatory drugs and surgery can help in some cases, and olfactory training can lead to significant improvement of post-viral olfactory deficits. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction is common and becomes more common with advancing age. It is increasingly receiving attention as an important sign for the early diagnosis and the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders.

24190245|t|Effects of rasagiline on olfactory function in patients with Parkinson's disease.
24190245|a|BACKGROUND: Impairment of olfactory function is a well recognized nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson's disease(PD). The aim of this investigation was to determine if the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline can improve olfaction in PD patients. METHODS: Thirty-four PD patients participated in this single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled,double-blind study. Seventeen patients were randomly assigned to rasagiline and 17 patients to placebo. Orthoand retronasal olfactory testing and recording of event related potentials were performed before and after 120 days of rasagiline versus placebo intake. RESULTS: When comparing olfactory score differences between baseline and after 120 days between the 2 groups, the level of significance was not reached. CONCLUSIONS: The primary end point of the study was not reached, and therefore, a specific effect of rasagiline on olfactory function in PD could not be demonstrated.

24643014|t|Identifying the clusters within nonmotor manifestations in early Parkinson's disease by using unsupervised cluster analysis.
24643014|a|BACKGROUND: Classical and data-driven classifications of Parkinson's disease (PD) are based primarily on motor symptoms, with little attention being paid to the clustering of nonmotor manifestations. METHODS: Clinical data on demographic, motor and nonmotor features, including the Korean version of the sniffin' stick (KVSS) test results, and responses to the screening questionnaire of the nonmotor features were collected from 56 PD patients with disease onset within 3 years. Nonmotor subgroups were classified using unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). In addition to unsupervised HCA, we performed a cross-sectional analysis comparing the performance on the KVSS olfactory test with other nonmotor manifestations of the patients. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (87.5%) had hyposmia based on the KVSS test. HCA suggested three nonmotor clusters for all PD patients and two nonmotor clusters in de novo PD patients, without a priori assumptions about the relatedness. In the cross-sectional analysis, dream-enactment behavior was more prevalent in patients with lower olfactory scores, implying impaired olfactory function (P = 0.029 for all PD patients; P = 0.046 for de novo PD patients). CONCLUSION: We propose the existence of different clusters of nonmotor manifestations in early PD by using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the identification of nonmotor subgroups based on unsupervised HCA of multiple nonmotor manifestations in the early stage of the disease.

24939002|t|Odor identification in frontotemporal lobar degeneration subtypes.
24939002|a|Odor identification impairment is a feature of several neurodegenerative disorders. Although neurodegenerative changes in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) subtypes involve areas important for olfactory processing, data on olfactory function in these patients are limited. An 18-item, multiple-choice odor identification test developed at our memory clinic, the Motol Hospital smell test, was administered to 9 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, 13 patients with the language variants, primary nonfluent aphasia (n = 7) and semantic dementia (n = 6), and 8 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Compared to the control group (n = 15), all FTLD subgroups showed significant impairment of odor identification (P < .05). The differences between the FTLD subgroups were not significant. No correlation between odor identification and neuropsychological tests results was found. Our data suggest that odor identification impairment is a symptom common to FTLD syndromes, and it seems to be based on olfactory structure damage rather than cognitive decline.

25916921|t|[Correlations between olfactory and cognitive functions in early stage Parkinson's disease].
25916921|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the general characteristics of olfactory and cognitive functions in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and examine their correlations. METHODS: The olfactory functions were assessed for 63 PD patients and 55 age and gender-matched normal subjects using T&T olfactory assessment. The scales of mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were employed. The olfactory and cognitive parameters and their relationship were analyzed. There were five different odors in T&T testing liquid and each odor had 5 concentration gradients. The level had an assigned value of 1 to 5 and number 3 represented the standard threshold of olfactory recognition. The mean value of five odors was overall olfactory detection or cognition threshold. RESULTS: (1) The olfactory detection and recognition thresholds were 4.0 +- 1.3/4.8 +- 0.9 in PD group versus 2.5 +- 0.9/2.9 +- 0.9 in normal controls. The scores of MoCA and MMSE were lower in PD group than those in controls (23.7 +- 3.0 vs 25.9 +- 2.0, t = 4.727, P = 0.000; 27.8 +- 1.9 vs 28.9 +- 0.9, t = 4.036, P = 0.000). (2) Linear correlation analysis showed that olfactory recognition threshold was correlated negatively with MoCA scores. The olfactory detection and recognition thresholds were correlated negatively with the score of visual-spatial perception and executive capability (r = -0.365, -0.403, P < 0.05). The olfactory recognition threshold was correlated negatively with the score of delayed memory (r = -0.299, P < 0.05). And this phenomenon was absent in controls. CONCLUSION: Early PD patients have olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment. And these two non-motor symptoms are negatively correlated.

25934852|t|Odor identification and Alzheimer disease biomarkers in clinically normal elderly.
25934852|a|OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate cross-sectional associations between odor identification ability and imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration and amyloid deposition in clinically normal (CN) elderly individuals, specifically testing the hypothesis that there may be an interaction between amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in predicting odor identification dysfunction. METHODS: Data were collected on 215 CN participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Measurements included the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and neuropsychological testing, hippocampal volume (HV) and entorhinal cortex (EC) thickness from MRI, and amyloid burden using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET. A linear regression model with backward elimination (p < 0.05 retention) evaluated the cross-sectional association between the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and amyloid burden, HV, and EC thickness, assessing for effect modification by PiB status. Covariates included age, sex, premorbid intelligence, APOE epsilon4 carrier status, and Boston Naming Test. RESULTS: In unadjusted univariate analyses, worse olfaction was associated with decreased HV (p < 0.001), thinner EC (p = 0.003), worse episodic memory (p = 0.03), and marginally associated with greater amyloid burden (binary PiB status, p = 0.06). In the multivariate model, thinner EC in PiB-positive individuals (interaction term) was associated with worse olfaction (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In CN elderly, worse odor identification was associated with markers of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, individuals with elevated cortical amyloid and thinner EC exhibited worse odor identification, elucidating the potential contribution of olfactory testing to detect preclinical AD in CN individuals.

26017214|t|Non-motor signs in Parkinson's disease: a review.
26017214|a|During the past decade the view of Parkinson's disease (PD) as a motor disorder has changed significantly and currently it is recognized as a multisystem process with diverse non-motor signs (NMS). In addition to been extremely common, these NMS play a major role in undermining functionality and quality of life. On the other hand, NMS are under recognized by physicians and neglected by patients. Here, we review the most common NMS in PD, including cognitive, psychiatric, sleep, metabolic, and sensory disturbances, discuss the current knowledge from biological, epidemiological, clinical, and prognostic standpoints, highlighting the need for early recognition and management.

26122543|t|The diagnostic value of dopamine transporter imaging and olfactory testing in patients with parkinsonian syndromes.
26122543|a|The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of olfactory testing and presynaptic dopamine imaging in diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS); to evaluate if the combination of these two diagnostic tools can improve their diagnostic value. A prospective investigation of 24 PD patients, 16 APS patients and 15 patients with non-parkinsonian syndromes was performed during an 18-month period. Single photon emission computed tomography with the presynaptic radioligand (123)I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN( )) and olfactory testing with the Brief 12-item Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) were performed in all patients. DaTSCAN was analysed semi-quantitatively, by calculating two different striatal uptake ratios, and visually according to a predefined ranking scale. B-SIT score was significantly lower for PD patients, but not significantly different between APS and non-parkinsonism. The visual assessment of DaTSCAN had higher sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared to olfactory testing. Most PD patients (75%) had visually predominant dopamine depletion in putamen, while most APS patients (56%) had visually severe dopamine depletion both in putamen and in caudate nucleus. The combination of DaTSCAN and B-SIT led to a higher rate of correctly classified patients. Olfactory testing can distinguish PD from non-parkinsonism, but not PD from APS or APS from non-parkinsonism. DaTSCAN is more efficient than olfactory testing and can be valuable in differentiating PD from APS. However, combining olfactory testing and DaTSCAN imaging has a higher predictive value than these two methods separately.

26136625|t|Abnormal Olfaction in Parkinson's Disease Is Related to Faster Disease Progression.
26136625|a|INTRODUCTION: A possible association between olfactory dysfunction and Parkinson's disease (PD) severity has been a topic of contention for the past 40 years. Conflicting reports may be partially explained by procedural differences in olfactory assessment and motor symptom evaluation. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-six nondemented PD patients performed the Brief-Smell Identification Test and test scores below the estimated 20th percentile as a function of sex, age, and education (i.e., 80% specificity) were considered demographically abnormal. Patients underwent motor examination after 12 h without antiparkinsonian medication. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent of PD patients had abnormal olfaction. Abnormal performance on the Brief-Smell Identification Test was associated with higher disease severity (i.e., Hoehn and Yahr, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III, Freezing of Gait questionnaire, and levodopa equivalent dose), even when disease duration was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal olfaction in PD is associated with increased severity and faster disease progression.

26179331|t|Delineating nonmotor symptoms in early Parkinson's disease and first-degree relatives.
26179331|a|Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are an important prodromal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, their frequency, treatment rates, and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the early motor phase is unclear. Rates of NMS in enriched at-risk populations, such as first-degree PD relatives, have not been delineated. We assessed NMS in an early cohort of PD, first-degree PD relatives and control subjects to address these questions. In total, 769 population-ascertained PD subjects within 3.5 years of diagnosis, 98 first-degree PD relatives, and 287 control subjects were assessed at baseline across the following NMS domains: (1) neuropsychiatric; (2) gastrointestinal; (3) sleep; (4) sensory; (5) autonomic; and (6) sexual. NMS were much more common in PD, compared to control subjects. More than half of the PD cases had hyposmia, pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, or urinary dysfunction. NMS were more frequent in those with the postural instability gait difficulty phenotype, compared to the tremor dominant (mean total number of NMS 7.8 vs. 6.2; P < 0.001). PD cases had worse HRQoL scores than controls (odds ratio: 4.1; P < 0.001), with depression, anxiety, and pain being stronger drivers than motor scores. NMS were rarely treated in routine clinical practice. First-degree PD relatives did not significantly differ in NMS, compared to controls, in this baseline study. NMS are common in early PD and more common in those with postural instability gait difficulty phenotype or on treatment. Despite their major impact on quality of life, NMS are usually under-recognized and untreated.

26626018|t|Olfaction in Parkin single and compound heterozygotes in a cohort of young onset Parkinson's disease patients.
26626018|a|BACKGROUND: Parkin related Parkinson's disease (PD) is differentiated from idiopathic PD by absent or sparse Lewy bodies, and preserved olfaction. The significance of single Parkin mutations in the pathogenesis of PD is debated. OBJECTIVES: To assess olfaction results according to Parkin mutation status. To compare the prevalence of Parkin single heterozygous mutations in patients diagnosed with PD to the rate in healthy controls in order to establish whether these single mutations could be a risk factor for developing PD. METHODS: Parkin gene mutation testing was performed in young onset PD (diagnosed <50 years old) to identify three groups: Parkin homozygous or compound heterozygote mutation carriers, Parkin single heterozygote mutation carriers, and non-carriers of Parkin mutations. Olfaction was tested using the 40-item British version of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT). RESULTS: Of 344 young onset PD cases tested, 8 (2.3%) were Parkin compound heterozygotes and 13 (3.8%) were Parkin single heterozygotes. Olfaction results were available in 282 cases (eight compound heterozygotes, nine single heterozygotes, and 265 non-carriers). In Parkin compound heterozygotes, the median UPSIT score was 33, interquartile range (IQR) 28.5-36.5, which was significantly better than in single Parkin heterozygotes (median 19, IQR 18-28) and non-carriers (median score 22, IQR 16-28) (ANOVA P < 0.001). These differences persisted after adjusting for age, disease duration, gender, and smoking (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in UPSIT scores between single heterozygotes and non-carriers (P = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Parkin compound heterozygous mutations have relatively preserved olfaction compared to Parkin single heterozygotes and non-carriers. The prevalence of Parkin single heterozygosity is similar to the 3.7% rate reported in healthy controls.

26776568|t|Effect of olfactory impairment and white matter hyperintensities on cognition in Parkinson's disease.
26776568|a|INTRODUCTION: Although white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and olfactory dysfunction are independently associated with the cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD), the effects of simultaneous presence of these abnormalities remain unknown. Thus, we investigated the different effects of deep WMH and periventricular WMH on olfactory and cognitive performance and evaluated the additive effects of the concurrent presence of WMH and olfactory dysfunction on cognitive performance in PD. METHODS: We enrolled 171 patients with non-demented PD whose WMH scores were assessed using a semi-quantitative visual rating system. The olfactory and cognitive performance was assessed using the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification (CCSI) test and the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery. Additionally, the additive effects of concurrent WMH and olfactory dysfunction on cognitive performance were investigated using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The deep WMH score exhibited a significant negative correlation with the CCSI score (p = 0.026) but the total WMH and periventricular WMH did not. A multiple regression analysis revealed that the total WMH (beta = -0.109, p = 0.011) and deep WMH (beta = -0.153, p = 0.020) severities had significant negative correlations with semantic fluency. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the simultaneous presence of severe olfactory dysfunction and deep WMH was associated with a greater risk for the semantic fluency impairments (odds ratio = 15.909, p = 0.0005) compared to patients with mild deep WMH or high CCSI scores. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that deep WMH was closely coupled with olfactory impairments and cognitive decline in PD. Moreover, the concurrent presence of severe deep WMH and olfactory impairments has a greater influence on semantic fluency.

26948859|t|Valproic acid ameliorates olfactory dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice of Alzheimer's disease: Ameliorations from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb.
26948859|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, pointing to the progression to dementia. Recent studies have revealed that valproic acid (VPA) has neuroprotective effects in rodent models of AD. In this study, we investigated the effects of VPA on olfactory dysfunction of APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse models of AD. After continuous treatment with a 100mg/kg daily dose of VPA for 3 months, APP/PS1 mice showed improved olfactory performances. In agreement with the behavioral findings, VPA treatment reduced amyloid beta (Abeta) burden in the olfactory epithelium (OE) of transgenic mice. And, VPA increased epithelial thickness of the olfactory mucosa through decreased cell apoptosis and increased cell proliferation. In the olfactory bulb (OB), VPA administration also reduced senile plaques and levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta42 peptides. Besides, VPA promoted the increase of mitral cells and decrease of neurofilament immunostaining. In hence, VPA treatment completely improved the olfactory performances and prevented degenerative changes of the OE and OB. Our study raises the possibility of AD diagnosis by OE biopsy. Moreover, VPA may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction in AD patients.

27063616|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis: A scoping review of the literature.
27063616|a|OBJECTIVE: Olfactory dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has been reported, but results have been inconsistent. In this review we describe, synthesize, and interpret the existing literature on olfactory dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis and identify gaps in the current level of knowledge. METHODS: The study design was a scoping review of the literature covering several study designs. Systematic Searches of the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO and Google Scholar databases were conducted that included key words related to Multiple Sclerosis and Olfaction Disorders. Literature that met the criteria of pertaining to both Multiple Sclerosis and olfactory dysfunction was identified, with the aim of providing an overview of the extent and types of research available in this area. RESULTS: Sixty-one reports were identified in the initial search, with 40 meeting the study criteria. Twenty-five clinical studies were included. Among them, 23 studies measured for olfactory dysfunction in MS patients, ten evaluated MRI correlates of olfactory dysfunction, and five evaluated neurophysiology correlates of olfactory dysfunction. Six of the included studies were abstracts. In addition, thirteen reviews/commentaries and two case studies were included. The majority of the studies identified some degree of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients, and various aspects and correlations with olfactory impairment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The overall weight of the literature suggests that olfactory dysfunction may occur in MS. Although there is variability in reported frequency, the more robust studies suggest the prevalence is significant, ranging from 20% to 45% in the MS population. Despite this, the mechanisms are unknown and the clinical relevance of this association has not been well explored. Interesting findings relating mood disorders, cognition, and olfactory dysfunction in MS are also suggested but remain poorly developed and require further investigation. Future studies are also warranted to understand the dynamic changes in olfactory function during the course of MS, and to correlate olfactory function with relapses/disease activity.

27098668|t|Olfactory dysfunction is related to postoperative delirium in Parkinson's disease.
27098668|a|Operations often lead to delirium in elderly patients, particularly those with impaired cognition, suggesting that underlying neuropathology may play a role in the development of postoperative delirium. Olfactory dysfunction is a well-known marker of underlying Lewy body pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the prognostic value of olfaction for the development of postoperative delirium in PD remains unclear. 34 PD patients with or without postoperative delirium following surgery under general anesthesia were included in this study (n = 17 for each group). Cross-Cultural Smell Identification scores were lower in PD patients with postoperative delirium (4.4 +- 1.5) relative to the delirium-free controls (6.8 +- 2.4, p < 0.005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that olfaction and operation time were significant predictors of the development of postoperative delirium. Impaired olfaction is significantly associated with postoperative delirium in PD. Olfaction may be useful for identifying PD patients susceptible to postoperative delirium.

27262147|t|The nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease: pathophysiology and management advances.
27262147|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In recent years progress has been made in the detection and evaluation of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. The pathophysiology is better understood and new treatment is available, which will be discussed in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: The most intriguing recent finding is the fact that Parkinson's disease may be a spreading disease. From the environment a toxin, bacteria, or virus may start in genetically susceptible patients a cascade of alpha-synuclein aggregation which reaches via the olfactory and the enteric system of the gut the brain where further spreading causes symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, motor impairment, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. New treatment should address the abnormal alpha-synuclein folding. If this would be achieved premotor signs, such as hyposmia, rapid eye movement-sleep behavior disorder, constipation, or depression may be a kind of biomarkers which allow together with other diagnostic tools, such as parenchymal sonography, iodobenzamide-scintigraphy and dopamine transporter scans the prediction whether somebody might be under way to develop the full-blown Parkinson's disease syndrome. SUMMARY: Parkinson's disease seems to be a spreading disease which causes not only a dopaminergic deficit as major cause for the movement disorder but also impairs function of many other brain centers which leads to a multitransmitter malfunction.

27538667|t|The combined effect of REM sleep behavior disorder and hyposmia on cognition and motor phenotype in Parkinson's disease.
27538667|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are recognized as pre-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive dysfunction is observed at a high rate even in the early stages of PD as an important non-motor symptom. PD has been classified in different subtypes and it is unknown if olfactory dysfunction and RBD occur more often in one particular subtype. We investigated the relationship between olfactory impairment, RBD, initial cognitive performance and motor phenotype in PD. METHOD: Nighty-eight patients with drug-naive idiopathic PD who visited the Movement Disorders Unit of Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea from March 2012 to February 2014 were retrospectively included. Patients were divided into tremor-dominant-type and akinetic-rigid-type PD subgroups using part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Olfaction was assessed by the Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test. RBD was screened using screening questionnaires. Initial cognitive function was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULT: The PD-normosmia group had higher MMSE scores (p=0.008). PD patients who have both RBD and olfactory dysfunction had lower MMSE scores (p=0.013). Presence of both RBD and hyposmia in PD patients was more strongly correlated with poor cognitive dysfunction. PD patients with RBD and/or hyposmia primarily exhibited the akinetic-rigidity phenotype. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction and RBD differed according to the motor phenotypes of PD. This suggests that olfactory dysfunction and RBD might relate to prognosis in patients with PD. Patients who have both hyposmia and RBD were more likely to exhibit cognitive dysfunction.

27556251|t|Patterns of olfactory impairment reflect underlying disease etiology.
27556251|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether the pattern of olfactory impairment seen in psychophysical testing reflects underlying disease etiology. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1,226 patients from our tertiary referral center. Only hyposmic patients with the following conditions were included: postinfectious hyposmia, posttraumatic hyposmia, hyposmia secondary to sinonasal disease, and hyposmia secondary to Parkinson disease. Patients with anosmia were excluded. RESULTS: Using a repeated measures analysis of variance (within subject factor "test": threshold [T], discrimination [D], identification [I]; between subject factor: "etiology") with posthoc Bonferroni corrected t tests, we found significant interaction between the factors "test" and "etiology" (F6,2444 = 8.46, P < 0.001), indicating that different causes of hyposmia produce different patterns of olfactory loss with respect to the individual subtests T, D, and I . Specifically, patients with Parkinson disease performed relatively well in odor threshold testing, but poorly in odor identification and discrimination compared with the other etiology groups. Conversely, patients with sinonasal disease performed well in odor identification and discrimination but poorly in odor threshold. Patients with postinfectious and posttraumatic hyposmia performed relatively well in both thresholds and discrimination but poorly in identification. However, patients with posttraumatic hyposmia had globally reduced scores compared with the other groups. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to comprehensively show that patterns of olfactory impairment reflect underlying disease etiology. We suggest that multicomponent olfactory testing should be performed, especially if there is diagnostic uncertainty. However, to clearly separate different patterns of olfactory loss to the various causes at an individual level, more work is needed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4. Laryngoscope, 2016 127:291-295, 2017.

27699718|t|Olfactory Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease Patients with the LRRK2 G2385R Variant.
27699718|a|Olfactory dysfunction has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients carrying the LRRK2 G2019S variant in Caucasians but rarely in those with the LRRK2 G2385R variant. In this study, we performed genotyping for the LRRK2 G2385R variant in PD patients recruited from the Movement Disorder Clinic of Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing and in healthy controls randomly selected from the Beijing Longitudinal Study on Aging cohort. The "five-odor olfactory detection array", an olfactory threshold test, was used to assess olfactory function. One hundred and eighty-six participants were enrolled, comprising 43 PD patients without (iPD) and 25 with (LRRK2-PD) the LRRK2 G2385R variant, and 118 healthy controls. Our results showed that the threshold of olfactory identification was significantly worse in PD patients than in controls, but not significantly different between the iPD and LRRK2-PD groups. These findings suggested that although olfactory function in LRRK2-PD patients is impaired, it is similar to that in iPD patients.

28351487|t|Viremic attack explains the dual-hit theory of Parkinson's disease.
28351487|a|The dual-hit theory of Parkinson's disease proposes that an airborne pathogen attacks both the olfactory and enteric nervous systems to initiate the Lewy pathology, gradually leading to devastating neurodegenerative processes within the brain. Based on published literatures, this article proposes a hypothesis that viruses with viremic potential can simultaneously attack both of these nervous systems via viremia due to the lack of a blood-nerve barrier in these tissues, thereby explaining the dual-hit theory. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying the neuropathology will facilitate development of better prophylactic and early intervention strategies against Parkinson's disease.

28552865|t|New development of diagnosis and treatment for Parkinson's disease.
28552865|a|New methods for the diagnosis and new treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) were explained. As imaging tools, neuromelanin imaging using brain MRI, meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy, dopamine transporter scintigraphy, and transcranial sonography were introduced. Olfactory dysfunction and REM sleep behavior disorders (RBD), which are important non-motor symptoms, and the new Clinical Criteria for PD launched by Movement Disorder Society (MDS) were also described. Investigative new medications and new anti-PD medications, which recently became available in Japan, were introduced. I explained the rationale of early treatment, strategy of initial treatment, the significance of continuous dopaminergic stimulation, strategy of treatment for advanced PD, and deep brain stimulation as a surgical treatment together with promising new treatments including gene therapy and cell transplantation.

28856094|t|Alterations in striato-thalamo-pallidal intrinsic functional connectivity as a prodrome of Parkinson's disease.
28856094|a|Although the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains anchored around the cardinal motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity and postural instability, it is becoming increasingly clear that the clinical phase of the disease is preceded by a long period of neurodegeneration, which is not readily evident in terms of motor dysfunction. The neurobiological mechanisms that underpin this prodromal phase of PD remain poorly understood. Based on converging evidence of basal ganglia (BG) dysfunction in early PD, we set out to establish whether the prodromal phase of the disease is characterized by alterations in functional communication within the input and output structures of the BG. We analyzed resting-state functional MRI data collected from patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and/or hyposmia, two of the strongest markers of prodromal PD, in comparison to age-matched controls. Relative to controls, subjects in the prodromal group showed reduced intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity in a striato-thalamo-pallidal network. Functional connectivity alterations were restricted to the BG and did not extend to functional connections with the cortex. The data suggest that local interactions between input and output BG structures may be disrupted already in the prodromal phase of PD.

28906025|t|Vitamin D in the Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome (PARS) study.
28906025|a|BACKGROUND: Lower vitamin D levels have been associated with manifest Parkinson's disease, prompting the hypothesis that vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency may increase risk for PD. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate vitamin D levels in a population at risk for developing PD. METHODS: Plasma vitamin D levels were measured in the Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome Study, a cohort of asymptomatic individuals, some of whom are at high risk for PD. Vitamin D levels were compared between subjects at high risk for PD (hyposmia and dopamine transporter scan deficit) versus all others and examined for correlations with dopaminergic system integrity. RESULTS: Mean vitamin D levels did not differ between groups, with a level of 27.8 ng/mL (standard deviation = 12.0) in the high-risk group versus 24.7 ng/mL (standard deviation = 9.0) in all others (P = 0.09). Vitamin D levels did not associate with putaminal dopamine transporter uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Our data from the asymptomatic Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome cohort do not support the hypothesis that chronic vitamin D insufficiency threatens dopaminergic system integrity, contributing to PD pathogenesis.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

28969383|t|A ventral glomerular deficit in Parkinson's disease revealed by whole olfactory bulb reconstruction.
28969383|a|Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease and is an early symptom, but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Hindering progress in our mechanistic understanding of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is the paucity of literature about the human olfactory bulb, both from normal and Parkinson's disease cases. Qualitatively it is well established that the neat arrangement of the glomerular array seen in the mouse olfactory bulb is missing in humans. But rigorous quantitative approaches to describe and compare the thousands of glomeruli in the human olfactory bulb are not available. Here we report a quantitative approach to describe the glomerular component of the human olfactory bulb, and its application to draw statistical comparisons between olfactory bulbs from normal and Parkinson's disease cases. We subjected horizontal 10 microm sections of olfactory bulbs from six normal and five Parkinson's disease cases to fluorescence immunohistochemistry with antibodies against vesicular glutamate transporter-2 and neural cell adhesion molecule. We scanned the immunostained sections with a fluorescence slide scanner, segmented the glomeruli, and generated 3D reconstructions of whole olfactory bulbs. We document the occurrence of atypical glomerular morphologies and glomerular-like structures deep in the olfactory bulb, both in normal and Parkinson's disease cases. We define a novel and objective parameter: the global glomerular voxel volume, which is the total volume of all voxels that are classified immunohistochemically as glomerular. We find that the global glomerular voxel volume in Parkinson's disease cases is half that of normal cases. The distribution of glomerular voxels along the dorsal-ventral dimension of the olfactory bulb in these series of horizontal sections is significantly altered in Parkinson's disease cases: whereas most glomerular voxels reside within the ventral half of olfactory bulbs from normal cases, glomerular voxels are more evenly spread among the ventral and dorsal halves of olfactory bulbs from Parkinson's disease cases. These quantitative whole-olfactory bulb analyses indicate a predominantly ventral deficit in the glomerular component in Parkinson's disease, consistent with the olfactory vector hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. The distribution of serine 129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein immunoreactive voxels correlates with that of glomerular voxels. The higher the serine 129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein load of an olfactory bulb from a Parkinson's disease case, the lower the global glomerular voxel volume. Our rigorous quantitative approach to the whole olfactory bulb will help understand the anatomy and histology of the normal human olfactory bulb and its pathological alterations in Parkinson's disease.

29063713|t|Cognition and the course of prodromal Parkinson's disease.
29063713|a|BACKGROUND: Prospective data on cognition in prodromal Parkinson's disease are limited. The objectives of this study were to assess in prodromal PD (1) if baseline cognition predicts conversion to clinical PD, (2) if baseline dopamine transporter binding predicts longitudinal changes in cognition, and (3) if impaired olfaction predicts future cognitive decline. METHODS: Prodromal participants were 136 hyposmic individuals enrolled in the Parkinson Associated Risk Study. We examined baseline neuropsychological test performance in PD converters versus nonconverters and the association between baseline dopamine transporter binding and change in cognition. An additional 73 normosmic individuals were included in analyses of the relationship between hyposmia and cognitive decline. RESULTS: In prodromal participants, baseline cognitive scores did not significantly predict conversion, but converters performed numerically worse on 5 of the 6 cognitive domains assessed, with the greatest differences in executive function/working memory (0.68 standard deviation lower) and global cognition (0.64 standard deviation lower). Lower baseline dopamine transporter binding predicted greater future decline in processing speed/attention (P = 0.02). Hyposmia predicted greater future decline in language (P = 0.005) and memory (P = 0.01) abilities. CONCLUSIONS: Given hyposmia in the general population predicts cognitive decline, the role of cognition in predicting conversion in prodromal PD needs to be assessed in large cohorts followed long-term. The dopamine system may be associated with changes in processing speed/attention in individuals at risk for PD.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

29653909|t|Comprehensive identification of delusions and olfactory, tactile, gustatory, and minor hallucinations in Parkinson's disease psychosis.
29653909|a|INTRODUCTION: Psychotic symptoms are underdiagnosed in Parkinson's disease (PD), and there is a need for a comprehensive PD psychosis rating scale. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 199 consecutive PD outpatients. After a routine clinical visit that included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMS-Quest), subjects completed the enhanced Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms in PD (eSAPS-PD), a structured clinical interview that included the standard SAPS-PD with additional prompts for delusions and olfactory, gustatory, and minor hallucinations. Based on the combined results of these assessments, subjects were categorized as having major psychotic symptoms (hallucinations or delusions; PDP-major), isolated minor psychotic symptoms (passage hallucinations, presence hallucinations, or illusions; PDP-minor), or no psychotic symptoms (PD-controls). RESULTS: We identified 58 subjects (29%) with psychotic symptoms, including 28 (14%) with major psychotic symptoms and 30 (15%) with isolated minor psychotic symptoms. Hallucinations were present in 56 subjects (28%); most commonly visual (24%, of which 21% were minor only), followed by olfactory (6%), tactile (4%), auditory (2%), and gustatory (1%). The eSAPS-PD detected psychotic symptoms in more subjects (n = 55, 28%) than all other assessments combined (clinical visit, UPDRS part 1, and NMS-Quest) (n = 22, 11%). Compared with PD-controls, PDP-minor subjects had a higher burden of other non-motor symptoms on the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (37 [27-51] vs. 18 [9-36], p < 0.001) and lower quality of life scores on the PD Quality of Life Questionnaire (138 [125-151] vs. 149 [137-165], p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The eSAPS-PD can markedly improve detection of psychotic symptoms in PD.

29784561|t|Parkinson's disease phenotype is influenced by the severity of the mutations in the GBA gene.
29784561|a|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene are divided into mild and severe (mGBA, sGBA) based on their contribution to the phenotype of Gaucher disease (GD) among homozygotes. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients carrying mutations in the GBA gene to better characterize genotype-phenotype correlations. METHODS: Patients underwent a comprehensive assessment of medical, neurological, cognitive and non-motor functions. Data from these patients was explored to evaluate differences in disease phenotype based on genotype. RESULTS: A total of 355 PD patients participated in this study; 152 idiopathic PD patients, 139 mGBA, 48 sGBA and 16 GD-PD. Groups were similar in age, sex, years of education and age of onset. Both sGBA and GD-PD had higher Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores (p = 0.041), higher frequencies of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (p = 0.022) and hallucinations (p < 0.0001) compared to the other groups of patients. sGBA experienced more non-motor symptoms (p < 0.0001), depression (p < 0.001) and worse hyposmia (p = 0.010). Trail making test was significantly longer in GD-PD followed by sGBA, mGBA and iPD (p = 0.005). DISCUSSION: Motor, cognitive, olfactory and psychiatric symptoms are more severe in sGBA and GD-PD compared to mGBA and iPD, reinforcing the notion that the severity of the PD phenotype is related to the severity of the mutation in the GBA gene.

29914019|t|Early Intervention with a Multi-Ingredient Dietary Supplement Improves Mood and Spatial Memory in a Triple Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
29914019|a|The increasing global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and failure of conventional treatments to stop neurodegeneration necessitates an alternative approach. Evidence of inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress prior to the accumulation of amyloid-beta in the prodromal stage of AD (mild cognitive impairment; MCI) suggests that early interventions which counteract these features, such as dietary supplements, may ameliorate the onset of MCI-like behavioral symptoms. We administered a polyphenol-containing multiple ingredient dietary supplement (MDS), or vehicle, to both sexes of triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice and wildtype mice for 2 months from 2-4 months of age. We hypothesized that the MDS would preserve spatial learning, which is known to be impaired in untreated 3xTg-AD mice by 4 months of age. Behavioral phenotyping of animals was done at 1-2 and 3-4 months of age using a comprehensive battery of tests. As previously reported in males, both sexes of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior at 1-2 months of age, prior to deficits in learning and memory, which did not appear until 3-4 months of age. The MDS did not reduce this anxiety or prevent impairments in novel object recognition (both sexes) or on the water maze probe trial (females only). Strikingly, the MDS specifically prevented 3xTg-AD mice (both sexes) from developing impairments (exhibited by untreated 3xTg-AD controls) in working memory and spatial learning. The MDS also increased sucrose preference, an indicator of hedonic tone. These data show that the MDS can prevent some, but not all, psychopathology in an AD model.

29936793|t|Impaired Taste Associative Memory and Memory Enhancement by Feeding Omija in Parkinson's Disease Fly Model.
29936793|a|Neurodegeneration can result in memory loss in the central nervous system (CNS) and impairment of taste and smell in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The neurodegeneration seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by functional loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have also found a role for dopaminergic neurons in regulating taste memory rewards in insects. To investigate how taste memories and sugar sensitivity can be affected in PD, we utilized the DJ-1beta mutant fruit fly, DJ-1betaex54 , as a PD model. We performed binary choice feeding assays, electrophysiology and taste-mediated memory tests to explore the function of the DJ-1beta gene in terms of sugar sensitivity as well as associative taste memory. We found that PD flies exhibited an impaired ability to discriminate sucrose across a range of sugar concentrations, with normal responses at only very high concentrations of sugar. They also showed an impairment in associative taste memory. We highlight that the taste impairment and memory defect in DJ-1betaex54 can be recovered by the expression of wild-type DJ-1beta gene in the dopaminergic neurons. We also emphasized the role of dopaminergic neurons in restoring taste memory function. This impaired memory property of DJ-1betaex54 flies also allows them to be used as a model system for finding supplementary dietary foods that can improve memory function. Here we provide evidence that the associative taste memory of both control and DJ-1betaex54 flies can be enhanced with dietary supplementation of the medicinal plant, omija.

30416108|t|[Impairment of Cross-modality: A New Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease].
30416108|a|It is known that Parkinson's disease impairs various cognitive functions including olfaction. However, until recently it was unclear whether Parkinson's disease also affects cross-modal function of vision and olfaction. A recent study showed that odor evaluation in patients with Parkinson's disease is unaffected by visual information, while healthy controls overestimated smell, when sniffing odorless liquid while viewing pleasant or unpleasant visual cues. Dopamine transporter deficit in the striatum, in particular in the posterior putamen, correlated with the limited visual effect in patients with Parkinson's disease. The findings suggest that Parkinson's disease impairs cross-modal function of vision and olfaction due to posterior putamen deficit. This review discusses that the cross-modal dysfunction may serve as the basis of novel precursor assessment of Parkinson's disease.

30465490|t|Smelling multiple sclerosis: Different qualities of olfactory function reflect either inflammatory activity or neurodegeneration.
30465490|a|BACKGROUND: Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and olfactory function are both emerging biomarkers in multiple sclerosis (MS). Impairment of odor identification and discrimination is an irreversible feature of more advanced MS suggested to be associated with neurodegeneration, while olfactory threshold is a transient feature of early, active MS possibly associated with short-term inflammatory disease activity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to validate the association of olfactory (dys)function and parameters of MS disease course in a large cohort of MS patients and to correlate olfactory function with pRNFL thickness as a surrogate biomarker of neurodegeneration. METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, olfactory function was assessed using the Sniffin' Sticks test, which quantifies three different qualities of olfactory function (threshold, discrimination, and identification). pRNFL thickness was measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Results were correlated with age, sex, disease duration, relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), cognitive function, depression, smoking, and pRNFL thickness by multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: We included 260 MS patients (mean age of 35.9 years, 68.7% female). Olfactory threshold correlated significantly with number of relapses in the year prior to assessment and shorter disease duration. Odor discrimination, identification, and their sum score were significantly correlated with longer disease duration, higher EDSS, and reduced cognitive function. pRNFL thickness was associated with identification and discrimination, but not with threshold. CONCLUSION: Olfactory threshold is a marker of short-term inflammatory relapse activity unrelated to parameters of neurodegeneration, while odor identification and discrimination are markers of neurodegeneration mostly independent of relapse activity. Assessment of olfactory function provides an opportunity to stratify MS patients with regard to inflammation and neurodegeneration.

30634006|t|The role of sensory sensitivity in predicting food selectivity and food preferences in children with Tourette syndrome.
30634006|a|Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by involuntary, repetitive and non-rhythmic motor and vocal tics. Despite suggestion that diet may affect tics, and the substantial research into children's diet, eating behaviours and sensory processing in comorbid disorders (e.g. ASD), research in TS is lacking. The present study examined differences between children with and without TS in parental reports of child selective eating, food preferences and sensitivity, and aimed to examine sensory sensitivity as a predictor of food selectivity outcomes in children with and without TS. Thirty caregivers of children with TS (M = 10 years 8 months [SD = 2.40]) and the caregivers of 30 age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children (M = 9 years 9 months [SD = 2.50]) completed the following measures online: Short Sensory Profile, Food Preference Questionnaire for Children, Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. Children with TS were reported to have significantly higher levels of food selectivity and sensory sensitivity, and less preference for fruit and vegetables than TD children. Importantly, while higher levels of overall sensory sensitivity predicted eating outcomes in the TS group, only sensitivity to taste/smell was found to be a predictor of food selectivity and preference for vegetables for both groups of children. The findings suggest that efforts to address food selectivity in children with TS may be enhanced by including strategies that address atypical sensory processing.

30738141|t|Olfactory bulb atrophy and caspase activation observed in the BACHD rat models of Huntington disease.
30738141|a|Olfactory dysfunction is observed in several neurological disorders, including Huntington disease (HD), and correlates with global cognitive performance, depression and degeneration of olfactory regions in the brain. Despite clear evidence demonstrating olfactory dysfunction in HD patients, only limited details are available in murine models and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In order to determine if alterations in the olfactory bulb (OB) are observed in HD we assessed OB weight or area from 3 to 12 months of age in the BACHD transgenic lines (TG5 and TG9). A significant decrease in the OB was observed at 6 and 12 months of age compared to WT. We also detected increased mRNA and protein expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) in the OB of TG5 compared to TG9 at specific ages. Despite the higher expression of mHTT in the TG5 OBs, there was increased nuclear accumulation of mHTT in the OB of TG9 compared to WT and TG5 rats. As we observed atrophy of the OB in the BACHD rats we assessed for caspase activation, a known mechanism underlying the cell death observed in HD. We characterized caspase-3, -6, -8 and - 9 mRNA and protein expression levels in the OB of the BACHD transgenic lines at 3, 6 and 12 months of age. Alterations in caspase mRNA and protein expression were detected in the TG5 and TG9 lines. However, the changes observed in the mRNA and protein levels are in some cases discordant, suggesting that the caspase protein modifications detected may be more attributable to post-translational modifications. The caspase activation studies support that cell death may be increased in the rodent HD OB and further our understanding of the olfactory dysfunction and the role of caspases in the pathogenesis of HD.

30919499|t|Prodromal Parkinson's Disease: The Decade Past, the Decade to Come.
30919499|a|The past decade has seen a dramatic expansion of the field of prodromal PD. Ten years ago, there were only six known prodromal markers of disease, none of which had more than two studies documenting diagnostic value. We now have at least 16 markers, with as many as 10 prospective studies for a single marker. This review summarizes the major advances over the last decade and speculates about the advances we will see in the decade to come. The most notable advances over the last decade came through the study of high-risk cohorts (REM sleep behavior disorder and later genetic and autonomic cohorts), the generation of more representative population-based cohorts for studying prodromal PD, major advances in neuroimaging of early disease stages, the emerging likelihood that tissue biopsy will be able to diagnose prodromal PD, and the coalescence of prodromal markers into discrete criteria. As the next decade dawns, we await increasing precision of sensitivity and specificity estimates of known markers, the discovery of new biomarkers of prodromal disease, improvements in diagnosis using combined methods/criteria (with increasing recognition of prodromal PD as one stage of the full PD spectrum), and ultimately the development of neuroprotective therapy that can be provided at the earliest stages of disease.   2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

30944919|t|Odor Identification Performance in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease Is Associated With Gender and the Genetic Variability of the Olfactory Binding Protein.
30944919|a|Deficits in olfaction are among the most frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and can be detected early compared with motor symptoms. The reason for the early onset, as well as the mechanism involved remains unknown. We aimed to characterize the olfactory performance of patients with PD and age-matched healthy control (HC) participants in association with gender and a specific polymorphism in the odorant-binding protein IIa (OBPIIa) gene, which plays a crucial role in the perception of odors. The olfactory performance was assessed using the odor identification part of the Sniffin' Sticks test in 249 participants (patients with PD: n = 131 and HC participants: n = 118). All participants were genotyped for the rs2590498 polymorphism of the OBPIIa gene, whose major allele A is associated with a higher retronasal perception than the minor allele G. A higher number of men with PD than women with PD exhibited hyposmia. Importantly, OBPIIa gene polymorphism showed an effect on PD-related olfactory deficits only in women. Women with PD carrying two sensitive alleles (AA) showed a better olfactory performance than women with PD with at least one insensitive allele (G); the olfactory scores of the AA genotype women with PD were not different from those of HC participants. In conclusion, our results confirmed a sex effect on the reduced olfactory performance of patients with PD and identified the OBPIIa locus, which may provide a mechanism to determine the risk factor for olfactory deficits in women with PD at the molecular level.

31125602|t|Evaluation of Carnosine Intervention in the Thy1-aSyn Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.
31125602|a|Parkinson disease (PD) is a leading neurodegenerative disease, with multifaceted interacting mechanisms. The Thy1-aSyn mouse model of PD exhibits many features of PD patients, including sensorimotor and olfactory dysfunction and protein aggregation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the dipeptide carnosine, which has anti-aggregating and metal-chelating properties, would provide beneficial effects on the motor and olfactory deficits observed in Thy1-aSyn mice. After 2 months of daily treatment with either intranasal (2 mg/day) or oral (10 mM in drinking water) carnosine, Thy1-aSyn mice and wild-type BDF1 mice were assessed for sensorimotor (challenging beam traversal test and spontaneous activity) and olfactory (buried pellet test) function. In addition, the olfactory epithelium was evaluated immunohistochemically for expression of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and the carnosine transporter Pept2. Olfactory function was unaffected by carnosine treatment via either administration route. In contrast, intranasal carnosine prevented the normal decline in gait function seen in the challenging beam test in the Thy1-aSyn mice. Moreover, carnosine-treated Thy1-aSyn mice exhibited decreased aSyn immunostaining in the olfactory epithelium compared to vehicle-treated Thy1-aSyn mice, and the carnosine transporter Pept2 was immunolocalized to the apical surface of the olfactory epithelium. These findings demonstrate that intranasal carnosine shows promise in slowing the progression of motor deficits and aSyn deposition in PD.

31271464|t|Predictive value of olfactory impairment for cognitive decline among cognitively normal adults.
31271464|a|OBJECTIVE: Dementia affects over 47 million people worldwide. Olfactory impairment (OI) is a well-established predictive marker of conversion to dementia among those with mild cognitive impairment. This systematic review aims to describe the predictive value of OI for future cognitive decline among cognitively normal adults. METHODS: A literature search encompassing PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane for longitudinal cohort studies following cognitively normal adults with baseline OI in comparison to those without OI reporting incident cognitive impairment or dementia was included. Study design, participant demographics, olfactory testing method, and incidence of cognitive decline or dementia were abstracted. Two investigators independently reviewed all articles. RESULTS: The search yielded 964 nonduplicate abstracts and titles, from which 19 full-text articles were reviewed and 10 were included. Studies included were all good quality (mean score 8.7 of 9), and all studies (100%) found a statistically significant association between baseline OI and incident cognitive decline compared with normosmic controls. CONCLUSION: The existing literature suggests that OI predicts future cognitive decline among cognitively normal adults, supporting olfactory evaluation as a low-cost, minimally invasive, and widely available screening tool to be used in combination with other tests to identify adults at early risk of dementia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 130:840-847, 2020.

31856640|t|Reduced cerebral blood flow in an alpha-synuclein transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
31856640|a|There is increasing evidence that widespread cortical cerebral blood flow deficits occur early in the course of Parkinson's disease. Although cerebral blood flow measurement has been suggested as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, as well as a means for tracking response to treatment, the relationship of cerebral blood flow to alpha-synucleinopathy, a major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, remains unclear. Therefore, we performed arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging on transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type alpha-synuclein and age-matched controls to measure cerebral blood flow and degenerative changes. As reported for early-stage Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein mice exhibited a significant reduction in cortical cerebral blood flow, which was accompanied by motor coordination deficits and olfactory dysfunction. Although no overt degenerative changes were apparent in diffusion tensor imaging images, magnetic resonance imaging volumetric analysis revealed a significant reduction in olfactory bulb volume, similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease patients. Our data, representing the first report of cerebral blood flow deficit in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, suggest a causative role for alpha-synucleinopathy in cerebral blood flow deficits in Parkinson's disease. Thus, alpha-synuclein transgenic mice comprise a promising model to study Parkinson's disease-related mechanisms of cerebral blood flow deficits and to investigate further its utility as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease.

32568206|t|Analysis of Taste Sensitivities in App Knock-In Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
32568206|a|BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported a decline in taste sensitivities in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, the detail remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of cognitive impairment on taste sensitivity using an App knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Behavioral assays, a brief access test, and a 48 h two-bottle preference test, to assess taste sensitivities were started from 12 months of age in mice that were confirmed to have impaired cognition. RESULTS: In the assays, there was no significant difference in taste sensitivities between wild type and App knock-in mice. Additionally, no apparent difference was observed in the expression of taste markers in their taste bud cells. CONCLUSION: We concluded that cognitive impairment might not greatly affect taste sensitivity.

33229797|t|Perception of pungent, gustatory and olfactory stimuli in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.
33229797|a|Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a rare disease caused by a mutation in the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, which results in an absence of Adelta and C fibers. It can be considered that this defect may also lead to deterioration of oral sensations. The aim of the present study was to clarify the ability of CIPA patients to perceive pungent, gustatory, and olfactory stimuli, which is essential for eating function, and the impact of the defect on dietary habits. Sensitivities to capsaicin and the five basic tastes were evaluated by measuring their threshold values, and dietary habits were examined using a questionnaire. Additionally, odor identification ability was evaluated using the odor stick method. The detection threshold for capsaicin and the recognition threshold for sour taste were significantly higher in the patients than in healthy volunteers. The questionnaire responses showed that the patients consumed spicy food more often. All patients were able to identify the tested odors, except those to which they had not been well accustomed. Since the abilities of CIPA patients to perceive taste and smell were not basically impaired, despite their lower sensitivity to capsaicin, it was suggested that their dietary habits were only minimally affected, except for intake of pungent foods.

33606814|t|Associations between probable REM sleep behavior disorder, olfactory disturbance, and clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease: A multicenter cross-sectional study.
33606814|a|BACKGROUND: Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and olfactory dysfunction are useful for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). RBD and severe olfactory dysfunction are also regarded as risk factors for cognitive impairment in PD. This study aimed to assess the associations between RBD, olfactory function, and clinical symptoms in patients with PD. METHODS: The participants were 404 patients with non-demented PD. Probable RBD (pRBD) was determined using the Japanese version of the RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ-J) and the RBD Single-Question Screen (RBD1Q). Olfactory function was evaluated using the odor identification test for Japanese. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Movement Disorder Society Revision of the Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts I-IV. RESULTS: In total, 134 (33.2%) patients indicated a history of pRBD as determined by the RBD1Q and 136 (33.7%) by the RBDSQ-J based on a cutoff value of 6 points. Moreover, 101 patients were diagnosed as pRBD by both questionnaires, 35 by the RBDSQ-J only, and 33 by the RBD1Q only. The MDS-UPDRS parts I-III scores were significantly higher and disease duration significantly longer in the pRBD group. pRBD was significantly associated with male gender and the MDS-UPDRS part I score. The olfactory identification function was significantly reduced in the pRBD group. CONCLUSIONS: About 33% of the patients with PD had pRBD based on the questionnaires, and both motor and non-motor functions were significantly decreased in these patients. These results suggest that more extensive degeneration occurred in patients with non-demented PD with RBD.

33663578|t|Enhancing GABAergic signaling ameliorates aberrant gamma oscillations of olfactory bulb in AD mouse models.
33663578|a|BACKGROUND: Before the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques and the onset of learning memory deficits, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience olfactory dysfunction, typified by a reduced ability to detect, discriminate, and identify odors. Rodent models of AD, such as the Tg2576 and APP/PS1 mice, also display impaired olfaction, accompanied by aberrant in vivo or in vitro gamma rhythms in the olfactory pathway. However, the mechanistic relationships between the electrophysiological, biochemical and behavioral phenomena remain unclear. METHODS: To address the above issues in AD models, we conducted in vivo measurement of local field potential (LFP) with a combination of in vitro electro-olfactogram (EOG), whole-cell patch and field recordings to evaluate oscillatory and synaptic function and pharmacological regulation in the olfactory pathway, particularly in the olfactory bulb (OB). Levels of protein involved in excitation and inhibition of the OB were investigated by western blotting and fluorescence staining, while behavioral studies assessed olfaction and memory function. RESULTS: LFP measurements demonstrated an increase in gamma oscillations in the OB accompanied by altered olfactory behavior in both APP/PS1 and 3xTg mice at 3-5 months old, i.e. an age before the onset of plaque formation. Fewer olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and a reduced EOG contributed to a decrease in the excitatory responses of M/T cells, suggesting a decreased ability of M/T cells to trigger interneuron GABA release indicated by altered paired-pulse ratio (PPR), a presynaptic parameter. Postsynaptically, there was a compensatory increase in levels of GABAAR alpha1 and beta3 subunits and subsequent higher amplitude of inhibitory responses. Strikingly, the GABA uptake inhibitor tiagabine (TGB) ameliorated abnormal gamma oscillations and levels of GABAAR subunits, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for early AD symptoms. These findings reveal increased gamma oscillations in the OB as a core indicator prior to onset of AD and uncover mechanisms underlying aberrant gamma activity in the OB. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the concomitant dysfunction of both olfactory behavior and gamma oscillations have important implications for early AD diagnosis: in particular, awareness of aberrant GABAergic signaling mechanisms might both aid diagnosis and suggest therapeutic strategies for olfactory damage in AD.

33924222|t|Molecular and Genetic Factors Involved in Olfactory and Gustatory Deficits and Associations with Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.
33924222|a|Deficits in olfaction and taste are among the most frequent non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD) that start very early and frequently precede the PD motor symptoms. The limited data available suggest that the basis of the olfactory and gustatory dysfunction related to PD are likely multifactorial and may include the same determinants responsible for other non-motor symptoms of PD. This review describes the most relevant molecular and genetic factors involved in the PD-related smell and taste impairments, and their associations with the microbiota, which also may represent risk factors associated with the disease.

34088871|t|Association of Lewy Bodies With Age-Related Clinical Characteristics in Black and White Decedents.
34088871|a|OBJECTIVE: The associations of Lewy bodies (LBs) with olfactory dysfunction, parkinsonism, and higher odds of dementia were assessed in Black and White community-dwelling elders and racial differences in these associations were tested. METHODS: Black decedents (n = 81) were matched 2-to-1 by age, sex, years of education, and follow-up time in the study with White decedents (n = 154) from 4 longitudinal studies of dementia and aging. Participants underwent uniform clinical examination and cognitive, motor, and olfactory testing. LBs were detected in 7 brain regions by alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry and racial differences in their association with olfaction, parkinsonism, and odds of dementia were determined using regression analyses. RESULTS: The mean scores of the odor test, global parkinsonism signs, and global cognition were lower in Black than White decedents; the frequency of dementia was similar in both groups. The frequency of LBs was similar in Black and White decedents (~25%), as was the frequency of LBs in individual brain regions, while the mean LB counts/mm2 were similar in all regions except the cingulate cortex, which showed higher mean LB counts in Black decedents. In regression analyses, LBs were associated with impaired olfaction (-2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.45 to -1.01) and higher odds of dementia (odds ratio 3.0, 95% CI 1.10-8.17) in both racial groups; an association with parkinsonism was stronger in Black than White decedents. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency, distribution, and clinical manifestations of LBs are similar in Black and White elders.

34366379|t|A Multisensory Deficit in the Perception of Pleasantness in Parkinson's Disease.
34366379|a|BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), due to the impact on quality of life. Anhedonia, the inability to experience joy and lust, has a prevalence of up to 46% in PD. The perception of pleasantness of an odor is reduced in anhedonia without PD. We previously showed a reduced hedonic olfactory perception in PD, i.e., patients evaluated odors as less pleasant or unpleasant compared to controls. This deficit correlated with anhedonia. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to confirm these findings. Moreover, we hypothesized that the perception of pleasantness in PD is affected on a multisensory level and correlates with anhedonia. Therefore, we assessed olfactory, visual and acoustic evaluation of pleasantness in PD and healthy individuals. METHODS: Participants had to rate the pleasantness of 22 odors, pictures, and sounds on a nine-point Likert scale. Depression, anhedonia, and apathy were assessed by means of questionnaires. Results of the pleasantness-rating were compared between groups and correlated to scores of the questionnaires. RESULTS: In particular pleasant and unpleasant stimuli across all three modalities are perceived less intense in PD, suggesting that a reduced range of perception of pleasantness is a multisensory phenomenon. However, only a reduction of visual hedonic perception correlated with anhedonia in PD. A correlation of reduced perception of pleasantness with apathy or depression was not present. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence for a multisensory deficit in the perception of pleasantness. Further studies should delineate the underlying neural circuity and the diagnostic value to detect neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD.

34833401|t|Advancement of PD Is Reflected by White Matter Changes in Olfactory Areas: A Pilot Study.
34833401|a|Loss of sense of smell is a well-known non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we present insight into the association between PD advancement and equivalents of smell loss in olfactory-eloquent brain areas, such as the posterior cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. Twelve PD patients in different Hoehn and Yahr stages and 12 healthy normosmic individuals were examined with diffusion tensor imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were used to analyze microstructural changes in white matter adjacent to the bilateral posterior and orbitofrontal cortex. Axial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were significantly higher in olfactory ROIs in advanced PD patients. The results of this preliminary study indicate that PD advancement is associated with progressive neurodegeneration in olfactory-related brain areas.

34958025|t|Human APOE e3 and APOE e4 Alleles Have Differential Effects on Mouse Olfactory Epithelium.
34958025|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-dependent disorder whose risk is affected by genetic factors. Better models for investigating early effects of risk factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype are needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether APOE genotype produces neuropathologies in an AD-susceptible neural system, we compared effects of human APOE e3 (E3) and APOE e4 (E4) alleles on the mouse olfactory epithelium. METHODS: RNA-Seq using the STAR aligner and DESeq2, immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3 and phosphorylated histone H3, glucose uptake after oral gavage of 2-[1,2-3H (N)]-deoxy-D-glucose, and Seahorse Mito Stress tests on dissociated olfactory mucosal cells. RESULTS: E3 and E4 olfactory mucosae show 121 differentially abundant mRNAs at age 6 months. These do not indicate differences in cell type proportions, but effects on 17 odorant receptor mRNAs suggest small differences in tissue development. Ten oxidoreductases mRNAs important for cellular metabolism and mitochondria are less abundant in E4 olfactory mucosae but this does not translate into differences in cellular respiration. E4 olfactory mucosae show lower glucose uptake, characteristic of AD susceptibility and consistent with greater expression of the glucose-sensitive gene, Asns. Olfactory sensory neuron apoptosis is unaffected at age 6 months but is greater in E4 mice at 10 months. CONCLUSION: Effects of human APOE alleles on mouse olfactory epithelium phenotype are apparent in early adulthood, and neuronal loss begins to increase by middle age (10 months). The olfactory epithelium is an appropriate model for the ability of human APOE alleles to modulate age-dependent effects associated with the progression of AD.

35902902|t|Olfactory swab sampling optimization for alpha-synuclein aggregate detection in patients with Parkinson's disease.
35902902|a|BACKGROUND: In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) detection of pathological alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in olfactory mucosa (OM) is not as accurate as in other alpha-synucleinopathies. It is unknown whether these variable results might be related to a different distribution of pathological alpha-syn in OM. Thus, we investigated whether nasal swab (NS) performed in areas with a different coverage by olfactory neuroepithelium, such as agger nasi (AN) and middle turbinate (MT), might affect the detection of pathological alpha-syn. METHODS: NS was performed in 66 patients with PD and 29 non-PD between September 2018 and April 2021. In 43 patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also obtained and all samples were analyzed by RT-QuIC for alpha-syn. RESULTS: In the first round, 72 OM samples were collected by NS, from AN (NSAN) or from MT (NSMT), and 35 resulted positive for alpha-syn RT-QuIC, including 27/32 (84%) from AN, 5/11 (45%) from MT, and 3/29 (10%) belonging to the non-PD patients. Furthermore, 23 additional PD patients underwent NS at both AN and MT, and RT-QuIC revealed alpha-syn positive in 18/23 (78%) NSAN samples and in 10/23 (44%) NSMT samples. Immunocytochemistry of NS preparations showed a higher representation of olfactory neural cells in NSAN compared to NSMT. We also observed alpha-syn and phospho-alpha-syn deposits in NS from PD patients but not in controls. Finally, RT-QuIC was positive in 22/24 CSF samples from PD patients (92%) and in 1/19 non-PD. CONCLUSION: In PD patients, RT-QuIC sensitivity is significantly increased (from 45% to 84%) when NS is performed at AN, indicating that alpha-syn aggregates are preferentially detected in olfactory areas with higher concentration of olfactory neurons. Although RT-QuIC analysis of CSF showed a higher diagnostic accuracy compared to NS, due to the non-invasiveness, NS might be considered as an ancillary procedure for PD diagnosis.

36702960|t|Non-visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.
36702960|a|BACKGROUND: Non-visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be prevalent and distressing. Most existing research has however, focused on visual hallucinations as well as related risk factors. The current study thus conducted a systematic review to collate existing evidence on non-visual hallucinations in PD, focusing on their prevalence, phenomenology, and clinical-cognitive correlates. METHODS: Ninety-one relevant studies were included from a systematic search across PsycINFO APA, PubMed, and Web of Science, for peer-reviewed publications in the English language, from 1970 to the present. These comprised a mix of case (30 studies; n = 56) and group design (62 studies; n = 7346) studies, divided into three somewhat overlapping collections to address our three research foci. RESULTS: Prevalence estimates for hallucinations were: auditory 1.5-72.0%, olfactory 1.6-21.0%, somatic-tactile 0.4-22.5%, gustatory 1.0-15.0%, and sensed presence 0.9-73.3%. Phenomenological inquiries revealed descriptions of vivid, consuming events replete with elaborate detail, adversely affecting PD patients in different ways. Overt experiences of multisensory hallucinations were also highly variable (0.4-80%) but exceedingly common, reported by almost half of the 45 included prevalence studies. There was some evidence for modality-specific hallucination predictors, but this was largely tentative, pending robust replication. CONCLUSIONS: Marked prevalence figures coupled with phenomenological descriptions implicating distress denote that non-visual and multisensory hallucinations in PD are of clinical significance. More direct research and clinical attention need to be devoted to the study and management of such hallucinatory experiences.

36716914|t|Progressive Spread of Beta-amyloid Pathology in an Olfactory-driven Amyloid Precursor Protein Mouse Model.
36716914|a|Years before Alzheimer's disease (AD) is diagnosed, patients experience an impaired sense of smell, and beta-amyloid plaques accumulate within the olfactory mucosa and olfactory bulb (OB). The olfactory vector hypothesis proposes that external agents cause beta-amyloid to aggregate and spread from the OB to connected downstream brain regions. To reproduce the slow accumulation of beta-amyloid that occurs in human AD, we investigated the progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid across the brain using a conditional mouse model that overexpresses a humanized mutant form of the amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) in olfactory sensory neurons. Using design-based stereology, we show the progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques within the OB and cortical olfactory regions with age. We also observe reduced OB volumes in these mice when hAPP expression begins prior-to but not post-weaning which we tracked using manganese-enhanced MRI. We therefore conclude that the reduced OB volume does not represent progressive degeneration but rather disrupted OB development. Overall, our data demonstrate that hAPP expression in the olfactory epithelium can lead to the accumulation and spread of beta-amyloid through the olfactory system into the hippocampus, consistent with an olfactory system role in the early stages of beta-amyloid-related AD progression.

37929819|t|Drosophila olfaction as a model system for studying human neurological disorders.
37929819|a|The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been one of the finest systems for decoding myriad puzzles across different domains of biology. Beyond addressing the fundamental problems, it has been used as a fantastic model organism for human disease research. Being an insect, Drosophila has a robust and advanced olfactory system that has been used many times as a model neuronal circuit to study fundamental questions in neurobiology. The circuit is well-explored at anatomical, physiological, and functional levels. It provides several advantages for the study of neurobiological disorders, such as spatiotemporally regulated misexpression or knockdown of disease proteins, genetic tractability, well-studied neuroanatomy, simple behavioural training paradigms, and quantifiable assays. Hence, Drosophila olfaction has been a favourite choice for the study of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, etc. This review aims to discuss earlier progress and future scope in using the Drosophila olfactory system for modelling human neurological pathophysiology for conducting fundamental and applied research. A major goal of research in biological science is to alleviate human disease burden. Diverse experimental systems are required to address different aspects of disease aetiology. Drosophila is one of the finest in vivo systems; its olfactory system is arguably the most well-characterized circuit for modelling human neurological disorders. A vast amount of research has been conducted to decipher cellular, molecular, and even cognitive aspects of human disorders using the Drosophila olfactory system. This review aims at summarizing such research progress to date and critically analysing the suitability of this system for modelling more complex neurological conditions.

38291474|t|Olfactory and cognitive decrements in 1991 Gulf War veterans with gulf war illness/chronic multisymptom illness.
38291474|a|BACKGROUND: Gulf War illness (GWI)/Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI) is a disorder related to military service in the 1991 Gulf War (GW). Prominent symptoms of GWI/CMI include fatigue, pain, and cognitive dysfunction. Although anosmia is not a typical GWI/CMI symptom, anecdotally some GW veterans have reported losing their sense smell shortly after the war. Because olfactory deficit is a prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and because we previously reported suggestive evidence that deployed GW veterans may be at increased risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia, the current study examined the relationship between olfactory and cognitive function in deployed GW veterans. METHODS: Eighty deployed GW veterans (mean age: 59.9  +-7.0; 4 female) were tested remotely with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Veterans also completed self-report questionnaires about their health and deployment-related exposures and experiences. UPSIT and MoCA data from healthy control (HC) participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study were downloaded for comparison. RESULTS: GW veterans had a mean UPSIT score of 27.8  +- 6.3 (range 9-37) and a mean MoCA score of 25.3  +- 2.8 (range 19-30). According to age- and sex-specific normative data, 31% of GW veterans (vs. 8% PPMI HCs) had UPSIT scores below the 10th percentile. Nearly half (45%) of GW veterans (vs. 8% PPMI HCs) had MoCA scores below the cut-off for identifying MCI. Among GW veterans, but not PPMI HCs, there was a positive correlation between UPSIT and MoCA scores (Spearman's rho = 0.39, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in UPSIT or MoCA scores between GW veterans with and without history of COVID or between those with and without Kansas GWI exclusionary conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of olfactory and cognitive deficits and a significant correlation between UPSIT and MoCA scores in a cohort of 80 deployed GW veterans, 99% of whom had CMI. Because impaired olfactory function has been associated with increased risk for MCI and dementia, it may be prudent to screen aging, deployed GW veterans with smell identification tests so that hypo- and anosmic veterans can be followed longitudinally and offered targeted neuroprotective therapies as they become available.

1642478|t|Lack of major olfactory dysfunction in MPTP-induced parkinsonism.
1642478|a|The olfactory function of 6 patients whose parkinsonism was the result of intravenous administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was compared to that of 12 age-matched patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 10 age-matched normal control subjects. Unlike their PD counterparts, the olfactory test scores of patients with MPTP-induced parkinsonism did not differ significantly from those of control subjects. These findings suggest that MPTP-induced parkinsonism, unlike idiopathic PD, is unaccompanied, on average, by major alterations in the ability to smell.

2938530|t|The toxicity of D-penicillamine in systemic sclerosis.
2938530|a|We studied D-penicillamine toxicity in 259 patients with systemic sclerosis treated since 1972. The average daily dose of 635 mg was given for a mean of 1.8 years. Of patients with systemic sclerosis, 47% has side effects from D-penicillamine treatment, similar to the 56% of 807 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in seven separate series. Individual manifestations of toxicity included rash, proteinuria, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysgeusia, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Four episodes each of myasthenia gravis and pemphigus occurred in our patients; both were reported rarely in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse effects occurred more frequently after rapid increases in dosage. Treatment had to be discontinued due to toxicity in 29% of patients with systemic sclerosis and in 33% of those with rheumatoid arthritis. Although toxic, with a high frequency of adverse effects, D-penicillamine can be used safely in the treatment of systemic sclerosis. Pemphigus and myasthenia gravis may occur more frequently with therapy for systemic sclerosis than with that for rheumatoid arthritis.

7651444|t|The anterior olfactory nucleus in Parkinson's disease.
7651444|a|Impaired olfaction occurs in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and Lewy bodies have been found in the olfactory bulb and tract. We now confirm the latter finding and show that this presence of Lewy bodies is associated with significant neuronal loss. A quantitative study of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) was performed in tissue obtained postmortem from seven patients with PD and seven age-matched controls. Neuronal loss was seen in the PD bulb and tracts (p < 0.01), and a strong correlation of neuronal loss with disease duration was detected (R = -0.87). The presence of Lewy bodies was confirmed with immunocytochemical staining for ubiquitin in all the PD cases.

9134451|t|Olfactory function in Huntington's disease patients and at-risk offspring.
9134451|a|Odor identification ability and detection threshold sensitivity were measured in 25 probands with Huntington's disease, 12 at-risk offspring, and 37 unrelated controls. Relative to controls and at-risk offspring, HD patients exhibited significant impairment on both measures of olfactory function. By contrast, at-risk offspring did not evidence any olfactory impairment relative to controls. Thus, impaired olfactory function does not aggregate in the family members of HD patients, and does not serve as an indicator of genetic vulnerability to the disorder.

9153598|t|Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
9153598|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate olfactory function in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: A standardised odour identification test was used, together with an evoked potential assessment with hydrogen sulphide. In addition, histological analysis was performed on the olfactory bulbs of cadavers who died from Parkinson's disease. RESULTS: Over 70% of patients studied (71 of 96) were outside the 95% limit of normal on the identification test in an age matched sample and there was an unusual pattern of selective loss to certain odours, not hitherto described. The evoked potentials were significantly delayed but of comparable amplitude to a control matched population. Of the 73 patients studied only 37 had a technically satisfactory record containing a clear response to both gases and of these, 12 were delayed. For H2S there was more delay on stimulating the right nostril than the left. Some patients with normal smell identification test scores had delayed evoked potentials. In the pathological examination of olfactory bulbs from eight brains, changes characteristic of Parkinson's disease (Lewy bodies) were seen in every olfactory bulb, particularly in the anterior olfactory nucleus, and were sufficiently distinct to allow a presumptive diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory damage in Parkinson's disease is consistent and severe and may provide an important clue to the aetiology of the disease.

9363356|a|This paper, presented in part as an invited lecture on the occasion of Professor E.P. Koster's retirement from Utrecht University, summarizes a large body of human studies performed at the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center during the last 17 years. Details of the development of standardized olfactory tests are provided, including their validation and application in a wide variety of clinical and laboratory settings. Included are studies related to transduction mechanisms in olfactory coding and factors that adversely influence olfactory function (e.g. age, gender, smoking, exposure to environmental chemicals, numerous diseases). A brief discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the olfactory vector hypothesis for neurodegenerative diseases is also presented.

10645703|t|Odor detection, learning, and memory in Huntington's disease.
10645703|a|We compared 7 mildly affected Huntington's disease (HD) patients to 7 age- and education-matched healthy controls (NC) on an odor detection test, the California Odor Learning Test, and the California Verbal Learning Test. Results demonstrated that odor detection sensitivity, but not group membership, accounted for significant variance in total olfactory learning. Both groups learned fewer items in the olfactory modality compared to the verbal modality, but retained a similar amount following a delay. No group differences were demonstrated for verbal recognition discriminability, but the HD group demonstrated significantly impaired odor recognition discriminability. Finally, odor detection provided excellent classification sensitivity and specificity between the patients and controls, suggesting that olfactory testing may provide a sensitive measure of the early disease process in HD.

11770926|t|Imaging of the olfactory system.
11770926|a|The olfactory system consists of the primary olfactory nerves in the nasal cavity, the olfactory bulbs and tracts, and numerous intracranial connections and pathways. Diseases affecting the sense of smell can be located both extracranially and intracranially. Many sinonasal inflammatory and neoplastic processes may affect olfaction. Intracranially congenital, traumatic, and neurodegenerative disorders are usually to blame for olfactory dysfunction. The breadth of diseases that affect the sense of smell is astounding, yet the imaging ramifications have barely been explored.

15312967|t|Impaired conditioned taste aversion learning in APP transgenic mice.
15312967|a|Cognition in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been predominantly characterized in explicit spatial orientation tasks. However, dementia in AD encompasses also implicit memory systems. In the present study a line of transgenic mice (TgCRND8) encoding a double mutated allele of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes was evaluated in an implicit associative learning task of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). CTA is a form of Pavlovian classical conditioning, in which a mouse learns to avoid a novel taste of saccharine (conditioned stimulus) paired with an experimentally induced (systemic injection of lithium chloride) nausea (unconditioned stimulus). In contrast to conditioned non-Tg mice, TgCRND8 APP mice developed weaker aversion against saccharine and quickly increased its consumption in repeated tests. These results indicate that TgCRND8 mice show a significant impairment not only in explicit spatial memory, as has been previously shown [Nature 408 (2000) 979], but also in implicit memory. Control experiments confirmed that TgCRND8 and non-Tg mice had comparable taste sensitivities in response to appetitive as well as aversive tastes. The study suggests that the CTA paradigm can be a sensitive tool to evaluate deficits in implicit associative learning in APP transgenic mouse models of AD.

16076406|a|The medical community has neglected olfactory dysfunction for a long time. However, over the last two decades, remarkable progress has been made in terms of understanding the sense of smell and both the assessment and diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction. Currently, there are only a few validated olfactory tests. The most commonly used one is the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Owing to its cultural biases, this test is mostly used in the United States. "Sniffin' Sticks" are one of the first European tests to be widely used. Since their development in 1996, they have been applied in numerous studies and have found increasing use in otolaryngology clinics. The goal of this article is to present Sniffin' Sticks and to provide a review of clinical olfactory research during recent years.

16609806|t|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 olfactory impairment shows a pattern similar to other major neurodegenerative diseases.
16609806|a|Olfactory function is affected in different neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been found that some hereditary ataxias are also associated with significant olfactory impairment. However, the initial findings did not examine the nature of the olfactory impairment associated with these ataxias. In the present article the effect of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) on olfactory function was studied in 53 SCA2 patients and 53 healthy control subjects from Holguin, Cuba. Several tests were applied to evaluate olfactory threshold, description, identification and discrimination. The results show significant impairment in SCA2 patients on all olfactory measurements, and the pattern of olfactory deficits found suggests that they have much in common with those reported for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

16903132|t|Estrogen and performance in recognition memory for olfactory and visual stimuli in females diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
16903132|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a deficit in episodic recognition memory for odors. It is hypothesized that the higher rate of AD in women may be due to estrogen-deprivation in postmenopausal women. Research suggests that estrogen may help to minimize cognitive decline in AD as well as postmenopausal olfactory loss. The current study examined the effects of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on performance of a recognition memory task for olfactory and visual stimuli in women AD patients. Participants included 24 women AD patients who were ERT users and 77 women AD patients who never used ERT. Compared with the ERT non-users, the ERT users committed significantly less false-positive memory errors for olfactory stimuli, whereas performance for visual stimuli did not differentiate between ERT users and non-users. The results suggest benefits of ERT could help ameliorate the earliest symptoms of AD, olfactory dysfunction, and memory impairment.

17050264|t|Olfactory functions in asymptomatic carriers of the Huntington disease mutation.
17050264|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder initially affecting the basal ganglia and especially the head of the caudate nucleus. Neuropsychological research has indicated that olfactory dysfunction may appear early in HD, prior to the onset of significant motor or cognitive dysfunction. The aim of this study was to examine whether asymptomatic carriers of the Huntington disease mutation also exhibit olfactory dysfunction. To address this issue we presented an extensive olfactory test battery comprising tasks assessing olfactory sensitivity, intensity discrimination, quality discrimination, episodic odor memory, and odor identification, to a group of gene carriers and nonmutation carriers of the disease. The results showed that gene carriers were selectively impaired in discriminating odor quality, although performance did not differ from noncarriers across the other tasks. The role played by striatum and then in particular the caudate nucleus for olfactory processing in general, and for odor quality discrimination in particular, is discussed.

18098296|t|Mild Parkinsonian signs are associated with lower olfactory test scores in the community-dwelling elderly.
18098296|a|Mild Parkinsonian signs (MPS, impaired gait, rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor) are commonly found during the clinical examination of older people and may be a precursor to Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Marked deficits in olfaction occur in PD and AD. The objective of this study was to determine whether University of Pennsylvania Smell Test (UPSIT) scores were lower in nondemented community-dwelling elderly with versus without MPS. Nondemented persons age >or=65 years without PD in Washington Heights-Inwood, NY were evaluated with an abbreviated motor Unified PD Rating Scale and a 40-item UPSIT. Lower UPSIT and higher transformed UPSIT score (square root [UPSIT - 41]) indicated greater olfactory dysfunction. One-hundred-seventy-seven (16.4%) of 1,078 participants had MPS. Mean UPSIT scores (MPS vs. without MPS) were 24.3 +/- 7.1 versus 26.4 +/- 6.8, P < 0.001. In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age and education, transformed UPSIT score was associated with MPS (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.52, P = 0.02). In an adjusted logistic regression analysis, participants with higher transformed UPSIT scores (based on a median split) were 1.55 times more likely to have MPS than were those with lower scores (P = 0.01). Within transformed UPSIT score quartiles, the odds of having MPS were 1.0 (reference), 1.35, 2.02, and 2.20 (P < 0.05). The association with transformed UPSIT scores was similar across MPS subtypes (axial dysfunction, rigidity, tremor).MPS were associated with a mild reduction in olfactory function. These observations further support the view of MPS as a marker of emerging degenerative brain pathologies.

18838108|t|Selective hyposmia in Parkinson disease: association with hippocampal dopamine activity.
18838108|a|Olfactory dysfunction is common in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and has been attributed to early pathological deposition of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in primary olfactory centers. However, olfactory deficits do not always worsen over time despite progression of disease raising the possibility of additional pathobiological mechanisms contributing to olfactory functions in PD, such as changes in olfactory neurotransmitter functions. Neurotransmitter changes, such as altered dopaminergic status, may also better explain the selective nature of odor identification deficits in PD. Proper odor identification depends on higher order structures, such as the hippocampus, for olfactory cognitive or memory processing. Using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), we previously identified three odors (banana, licorice, dill pickle, labeled as UPSIT-3) that PD subjects most frequently failed to recognize compared to age- and gender-matched controls. We also identified six odors that were equally successfully identified by controls and PD subjects (NPD-Olf6). A ratio of UPSIT-3 divided by NPD-Olf6 scores provides another descriptor of selective hyposmia in PD ("olfactory ratio"). In this study we investigated the pathophysiology of hyposmia in PD using dopamine transporter (DAT) PET. Twenty-nine PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III; 7f/22m; age 60.2+/-10.8) underwent olfactory testing using the UPSIT and [(11)C]beta-CFT DAT PET. DAT binding potentials (BP) were assessed in the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral and dorsal striatum. We found that correlation coefficients between total UPSIT scores and regional brain DAT BP were highest for the hippocampus (Rs=0.54, P=0.002) and lower for the amygdala (Rs=0.44, P=0.02), ventral (Rs=0.48, P=0.008) and dorsal striatum (Rs=0.39, P=0.03). Correlations were most significant for the selective hyposmia measures and hippocampal DAT: UPSIT-3 (Rs=0.65, P=0.0001) and the olfactory ratio (Rs=0.74, P<0.0001). We conclude that selective hyposmia in PD is more robustly correlated with hippocampal rather than amygdala, ventral or dorsal striatal dopamine innervation as shown by DAT binding. These findings indicate that mesolimbic dopamine innervation of the hippocampus may be a determinant of selective hyposmia in PD.

19562770|t|Expanding the clinical phenotype of SNCA duplication carriers.
19562770|a|SNCA duplication is a recognized cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to explore the genetic and clinical variability in the disease manifestation. Molecular characterization was performed using real-time PCR, SNP arrays, and haplotype analysis. We further studied those patients who were found to harbor SNCA duplication with olfactory function tests, polysomnography, and PET. We identified four new families and one sporadic patient with SNCA duplication. Eleven symptomatic patients from these four families presented with parkinsonism, of which three subsequently developed dementia. The lifetime estimate of overall penetrance was 43.8%. FDG-PET study of symptomatic patients showed hypometabolism in the occipital lobe, whereas asymptomatic carriers of SNCA duplication demonstrated normal glucose metabolism. Symptomatic patients showed abnormal olfactory function and polysomnography and asymptomatic carriers showed normal results. The clinical features of SNCA duplication include parkinsonism with or without dementia. Asymptomatic carriers displayed normal test results with the eldest individual aged 79 years; thus, even a carrier of SNCA duplication may escape the development of PD. This difference in age-associated penetrance may be due to the genetic background or environmental exposures. Further studies of SNCA duplication carriers will help identify disease-modifiers and may open novel avenues for future treatment.

19569277|a|Throughout human evolution, smell lost its important role to be replaced by other senses. Although, it retained a "role"in several "healing" practices. The aim of this review was to analyze the possible roles and influences of olfaction on higher brain functions, like mood and memory, and in contrast heightened the influence of pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia on the olfactory function, based on recent animal and human data. In this neuro-psychiatric approach, the immune system could have a central role.

19775703|t|Immunohistochemical, volumetric, and functional neuroimaging studies in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
19775703|a|Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely associated with olfactory loss. Deficits in the sense of smell may precede clinical motor symptoms by years. Although there is more and more evidence from recent studies to support this view, it remains unclear which substrates would cause the olfactory deficit. Studies based on biopsies from the olfactory epithelium did not reveal specific changes in the nasal mucosa of PD patients compared to patients who were hyposmic for other reasons. Thus, PD-related olfactory impairment seems not to be directly associated with specific changes in the olfactory epithelium. With regard to volumetrics of the olfactory bulb (OB) results indicated that there is little or no difference between PD patients and healthy controls in terms of OB volume. Again, these data support the idea that olfactory loss in PD is not a consequence of damage to the olfactory epithelium but rather results from central-nervous changes. Finally, studies based on functional MRI suggested that neuronal activity in the amygdala and hippocampus is reduced in PD patients compared to controls which may specifically impact on olfactory function. In addition, neuronal activity in components of cortico-striatal loops appears to be up-regulated indicating compensatory processes involving the dopaminergic system. Thus, it seems that cerebral changes, and not changes at the level of the olfactory epithelium, are the basis of the olfactory loss observed in PD patients.

19783257|t|Olfactory system pathology as a model of Lewy neurodegenerative disease.
19783257|a|Olfactory dysfunction has gained recognition as an early and nearly universal feature of Lewy body Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, research efforts have focused on the use of early non-motor symptoms of PD as early biomarkers and have suggested that investigating neurodegeneration in the aspects of the nervous system subserving these symptoms may offer important insights into the pathophysiology of Lewy body PD. Therefore, there has been interest in characterizing the pathology observed in the olfactory bulb and system of patients with PD, dementia with Lewy bodies and perhaps more importantly, in subjects with incidental Lewy pathology, defined as people with Lewy pathology without evidence of Parkinsonism or dementia during life. The olfactory bulb may be ideally suited to investigations into the pathophysiology of the Lewy body disorders as it is one of the few areas of the brain wherein the entirety of neurons susceptible to Lewy neurodegeneration, including the dendritic arborization, cell soma, axon and synaptic terminals, can be examined in the same preparation. Interestingly, there is a lack of Lewy neurodegeneration in the dopaminergic neurons of the olfactory bulb and paradoxically, an apparent increase in dopaminergic neurons in some PD patients compared to controls. In this report, the known neuropathology of the olfactory system in PD will be reviewed and the advantages of investigating degeneration of the olfactory bulb as a model of Lewy neurodegeneration will be discussed.

20223708|t|Relevance of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity and reduced odor identification in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.
20223708|a|BACKGROUND: Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity determined by transcranial sonography (TCS) and olfactory dysfunction are common findings in Parkinson disease (PD), which may reveal a prodromal synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). METHODS: TCS and the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) were performed in 34 consecutive patients with iRBD (67.9+/-6.1years), 17 consecutive patients with PD (66.4+/-6.7years), and 21 control group subjects (64.4+/-5.8years). RESULTS: There was a significantly increased area of echogenicity in the SN in the iRBD group (0.20+/-0.13cm2) and PD group (0.22+/-0.11cm2) compared with the control group (0.06+/-0.06cm(2)). We found pathological SN hyperechogenicity (0.20cm2) in 41.2% of the iRBD group, 52.6% of the PD group, and 9.5% of the control group. Further, there were abnormal findings of both pathological SN hyperechogenicity (0.20cm2) and functional anosmia or hyposmia in 4 (11.8%) or 9 (26.5%) of the iRBD group subjects, respectively, and 7 (57.9%) or 2 (11.8%) of the PD group subjects, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pathological SN hyperechogenic abnormality and functional anosmia in iRBD may be a disease state in the transition to a neurodegenerative disease.

Although nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation is a key patholobiological feature of PD, age-associated nigrostriatal denervation (AASDD) occurs also with normal aging and can be more prominent in some elderly. We investigated the relationship between AASDD and olfactory performance in community-dwelling subjects. Community-dwelling subjects (n=73, 44 F/29 M, mean age 64.0+-16.4, range 20-85) underwent brain dopamine transporter (DAT) [(11)C]2-beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (beta-CFT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and olfactory assessment using the 40-odor University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Subjects with clinical or DAT PET evidence of Parkinson disease (PD) were not eligible for the study. AASDD was defined based on normative data in young and middle-aged subjects. Compared to a mild and general linear decline in odor identification observed in most subjects (R(2)=0.18, P=0.0002), there were 13 subjects who deviated below the 5% confidence interval level in age-predicted UPSIT scores. Analysis limited to elderly subjects 60 years and over demonstrated a significant association between poor smell (n=10 out of 49, 20.4%) and AASDD (chi(2)=4.4, P<0.05). There is a significant association between olfactory dysfunction and more prominent nigrostriatal denervation in the elderly. Olfactory assessment may have potential as a screening tool to detect age-accelerated neurodegeneration in the elderly.

21075145|t|Modeling Parkinson's disease genetics: altered function of the dopamine system in Adh4 knockout mice.
21075145|a|Class IV alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH4) efficiently reduces aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation, and may thus serve to protect from toxic effects of aldehydes e.g. on neurons. We hypothesized that ADH4 dysfunction may increase risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) and previously reported association of an ADH4 allele with PD. We found that a promoter polymorphism in this allele induced a 25-30% reduction of transcriptional activity. Based on these findings, we have now investigated whether Adh4 homo- (Adh4-/-) or heterozygous (Adh4+/-) knockout mice display any dopamine system-related changes in behavior, biochemical parameters or olfaction compared to wild-type mice. The spontaneous locomotor activity was found to be similar in the three groups, whereas administration of d-amphetamine or apomorphine induced a significant increase in horizontal activity in the Adh4-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. We measured levels of monoamines and their metabolites in striatum, frontal cortex and substantia nigra and found increased levels of dopamine and DOPAC in substantia nigra of Adh4-/- mice. Investigation of olfactory function revealed a reduced sense of smell in Adh4-/- mice accompanied by alterations in dopamine metabolite levels in the olfactory bulb. Taken together, our results suggest that lack of Adh4 gene activity induces changes in the function of the dopamine system, findings which are compatible with a role of loss-of-function mutations in ADH4 as possible risk factors for PD.

21301897|t|Mice with genetic deletion of the heparin-binding growth factor midkine exhibit early preclinical features of Parkinson's disease.
21301897|a|There is considerable evidence showing that the neurodegenerative processes that lead to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) begin many years before the appearance of the characteristic motor symptoms and that impairments in olfactory, cognitive and motor functions are associated with time-dependent disruption of dopaminergic neurotransmission in different brain areas. Midkine is a 13-kDa retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding growth factor involved in many biological processes in the central nervous system such as cell migration, neurogenesis and tissue repair. The abnormal midkine expression may be associated with neurochemical dysfunction in the dopaminergic system and cognitive impairments in rodents. Here, we employed adult midkine knockout mice (Mdk(-/-)) to further investigate the relevance of midkine in dopaminergic neurotransmission and in olfactory, cognitive and motor functions. Mdk(/-) mice displayed pronounced impairments in their olfactory discrimination ability and short-term social recognition memory with no gross motor alterations. Moreover, the genetic deletion of midkine decreased the expression of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra reducing partially the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the olfactory bulb and striatum of mice. These findings indicate that the genetic deletion of midkine causes a partial loss of dopaminergic neurons and depletion of dopamine, resulting in olfactory and memory deficits with no major motor impairments. Therefore, Mdk(-/-) mice may represent a promising animal model for the study of the early stages of PD and for testing new therapeutic strategies to restore sensorial and cognitive processes in PD.

21517181|t|Both odor identification and ApoE-epsilon4 contribute to normative cognitive aging.
21517181|a|Research indicates that apoliprotein E (ApoE) plays a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and possibly in the cognitive decline associated with normative aging. More recently, researchers have shown that ApoE is expressed in olfactory brain structures, and a relationship among ApoE, AD, and olfactory function has been proposed. In the current analyses, we investigated the contribution of ApoE and odor identification in decline trajectories associated with normative cognitive aging in various domains, using longitudinal data on cognitive performance available from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Data on both ApoE status and olfactory functioning were available from 455 individuals ranging in age from 50 to 88 years at the first measurement occasion. Odor identification was measured via a mailed survey. Cognitive performance was assessed in up to 5 waves of in-person testing covering a period of 16 years. Latent growth curve analyses incorporating odor identification and ApoE status indicated a main effect of odor identification on the performance level in three cognitive domains: verbal, memory, and speed. A main effect of ApoE on rates of decline after age 65 was found for verbal, spatial, and speed factors. The consistency of results across cognitive domains provides support for theories that posit central nervous system-wide origins of the olfaction-cognition-ApoE relationship; however, olfactory errors and APOE epsilon4 show unique and differential effects on cognitive trajectory features.

21741995|t|Olfactory memory is impaired in a triple transgenic model of Alzheimer disease.
21741995|a|Olfactory memory dysfunctions were investigated in the triple-transgenic murine model of Alzheimer's disease (3 x Tg-AD). In the social transmission of food preference test, 3 x Tg-AD mice presented severe deficits in odor-based memory, without gross changes in general odor-ability. Abeta and tau immunoreactivity was not observed in the primary processing regions for odor, the olfactory bulbs (OBs), whereas marked immunostaining was present in the piriform, entorhinal, and orbitofrontal cortex, as well as in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that the impairment in olfactory-based information processing might arise from degenerative mechanisms mostly affecting higher cortical regions and limbic areas, such as the hippocampus.

21753163|t|Phenotype in parkinsonian and nonparkinsonian LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers.
21753163|a|OBJECTIVES: Using a family study design, we describe the motor and nonmotor phenotype in probands with LRRK2 G2019S mutations and family members and compare these individuals to patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (iPD) and unrelated controls. METHODS: Probands with G2019S mutations and their first-degree relatives, subjects with iPD, and unrelated control subjects were identified from 4 movement disorders centers. All underwent neurologic examinations and tests of olfaction, color vision, anxiety, and depression inventories. RESULTS: Tremor was more often a presenting feature among 25 individuals with LRRK2-associated PD than among 84 individuals with iPD. Subjects with LRRK2-PD had better olfactory identification compared with subjects with iPD, higher Beck Depression Inventory scores, and higher error scores on Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test of color discrimination. Postural or action tremor was more common among 29 nonmanifesting mutation carriers compared with 53 noncarriers within the families. Nonparkinsonian family members had higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores, more constipation, and worse color discrimination than controls, regardless of mutation status. CONCLUSIONS: Although tremor is a more common presenting feature of LRRK2-PD than iPD and some nonmotor features differed in degree, the phenotype is largely overlapping. Postural or action tremor may represent an early sign. Longitudinal evaluation of a large sample of nonmanifesting carriers will be required to describe any premotor phenotype that may allow early diagnosis.

22049439|t|Sensory network dysfunction, behavioral impairments, and their reversibility in an Alzheimer's beta-amyloidosis mouse model.
22049439|a|The unique vulnerability of the olfactory system to Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides a quintessential translational tool for understanding mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction and pathological progression in the disease. Using the Tg2576 mouse model of beta-amyloidosis, we show that aberrant, hyperactive olfactory network activity begins early in life, before detectable behavioral impairments or comparable hippocampal dysfunction and at a time when amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition is restricted to the olfactory bulb (OB). Hyperactive odor-evoked activity in the piriform cortex (PCX) and increased OB-PCX functional connectivity emerged at a time coinciding with olfactory behavior impairments. This hyperactive activity persisted until later in life when the network converted to a hyporesponsive state. This conversion was Abeta-dependent, because liver-X receptor agonist treatment to promote Abeta degradation rescued the hyporesponsive state and olfactory behavior. These data lend evidence to a novel working model of olfactory dysfunction in AD and, complimentary to other recent works, suggest that disease-relevant network dysfunction is highly dynamic and region specific, yet with lasting effects on cognition and behavior.

22285107|t|Impaired decision-making in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.
22285107|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) frequently develop Parkinson's disease (PD), which can impair decision-making ability. This study was undertaken to investigate decision-making ability and its relation to olfactory function in patients with idiopathic RBD. METHODS: This study used the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Sniffin' Stick Test for examination of 38 patients with idiopathic RBD (iRBD) and 34 age-matched healthy control subjects (HC). Associations between these test results and other clinical RBD variables were also assessed. RESULTS: Total IGT score and Sniffin' Stick Test scores were significantly lower in the iRBD group than in the HC group. The iRBD group IGT scores in the first, third, and final blocks were significantly lower than those of the HC group. In the iRBD group, no association was found between the total IGT score and the Sniffin' Stick Test score or any clinical RBD variable. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired decision-making associated with iRBD can herald PD. However, decision-making disability is thought to appear irrespective of olfactory dysfunction and progression of RBD pathology.

22469332|t|Taste disorders in myasthenia gravis: a multicenter cooperative study.
22469332|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of taste disorders in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). METHODS: We studied 371 Japanese patients with MG (127 men and 244 women; mean age, 56.6+-16.9years) consecutively evaluated between May and September 2010 in six neurological centers comprising the East Japan MG Study Group. Ninety-three patients (25%) had thymoma. We interviewed all patients to determine whether they had taste disorders during the clinical course of MG and then further evaluated the patients with MG, who reported having taste disorders, using a questionnaire. RESULTS: Taste disorders were observed in 16 (4.3%) of the 371 patients with MG. We concluded that taste disorders in 2.4% of patients with MG excluding other factors were associated with MG itself. All patients had thymoma with seropositivity for anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Thymoma tended to be advanced, and four patients with Masaoka stage IVa required radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Five patients noticed taste disorders 2-3 months before the onset of MG. Sweet taste loss was more common than salty, bitter, and sour taste loss. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first systematic survey of taste disorders in patients with MG by a multicenter study. Taste disorders were more common in the present sample of patients with MG than in the general population.

22682755|t|Olfaction, dyskinesia and profile of weight change in Parkinson's disease: identifying neurodegenerative phenotypes.
22682755|a|OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between olfaction and body weight profile in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Prospective assessment of 99 PD patients for clinical parameters, olfaction using UPSIT and current and previous body weight. Patients were categorised as weight losers (WL) and non-weight losers (NWL) depending on change of weight from previous years. Olfaction was categorised into two groups at the cut-off of the median level of UPSIT scores. Data was analysed to study the relationship of olfaction on weight change. RESULTS: Thirty-nine were weight losers (WL) and 60 non-weight losers (NWL). WL were significantly older (p = 0.02), females (p = 0.03) and had more severe impairment of olfaction, UPSIT 15 +- 4 vs 19 +- 5; p < 0.004. Patients with more severe olfaction (anosmic) impairment were older (p = 0.001) and had significantly lower weight, 75 vs 83 kg, p = 0.01. There was no difference in the proportion of smokers, medication usage, difficult swallowing or calorie consumption in any group. Weight losers and severe olfaction loss were associated with more severe H&Y stage. Patients below the median-UPSIT (anosmic) had lost weight during the previous years whereas those above the median (hyposmic) had gained weight. Regression analysis revealed UPSIT at the median level to be the most significant variable (p < 0.001) for weight loss. There was continuous loss of olfaction with increasing disease severity. Higher olfactory loss was associated with higher risk of dyskinesia. CONCLUSION: Early assessment of olfaction may identify patients of different phenotypes for weight change and risk of dyskinesia during the course of the disease.

22733427|t|Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and subtypes of Parkinson's disease.
22733427|a|Numerous studies have explored the potential relationship between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and manifestations of PD. Our aim was to perform an expanded extensive assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations in PD to identify whether RBD was associated with differences in the nature and severity of these manifestations. PD patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose the presence of RBD. Participants then underwent an extensive evaluation by a movement disorders specialist blinded to PSG results. Measures of disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, therapy complications, and autonomic, psychiatric, visual, and olfactory dysfunction were assessed and compared using regression analysis, adjusting for disease duration, age, and sex. Of 98 included patients, 54 had RBD and 44 did not. PD patients with RBD were older (P = 0.034) and were more likely to be male (P < 0.001). On regression analysis, the most consistent links between RBD and PD were a higher systolic blood pressure (BP) change while standing (-23.9 +- 13.9 versus -3.5 +- 10.9; P < 0.001), a higher orthostatic symptom score (0.89 +- 0.82 versus 0.44 +- 0.66; P = 0.003), and a higher frequency of freezing (43% versus 14%; P = 0.011). A systolic BP drop >10 could identify PD patients with RBD with 81% sensitivity and 86% specificity. In addition, there was a probable relationship between RBD and nontremor predominant subtype of PD (P = 0.04), increased frequency of falls (P = 0.009), and depression (P = 0.009). Our results support previous findings that RBD is a multifaceted phenomenon in PD. Patients with PD who have RBD tend to have specific motor and nonmotor manifestations, especially orthostatic hypotension.

23250125|t|Nonmotor symptoms in drug-induced parkinsonism and drug-naive Parkinson disease.
23250125|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical manifestations of drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) and Parkinson disease (PD) are nearly indistinguishable, making it difficult to differentiate DIP from PD, especially in the early stages. We compared non-motor symptoms between patients with DIP and those with drug-naive PD in the early stages using the Non Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 28 patients with DIP, 35 patients with drug-naive PD, and 32 controls with no history of neurological diseases or related medical problems. We investigated demographic characteristics, medical and drug history, parkinsonian motor symptoms, and non-motor symptoms. We used the NMSS to evaluate non-motor symptoms in all patients. RESULTS: The total NMSS scores were higher in patients with PD than those with DIP, as were the scores for certain domains, including the cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, urinary, sexual, and miscellaneous domains. When controlling for age and gender, the correlation analysis revealed that scores for urinary symptoms (urgency, frequency and nocturia), sleep disturbances (daytime sleep, restless legs), concentration, taste or smell were significantly associated with PD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that non-motor symptoms, particularly urinary symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, restless leg syndrome, attention deficit and hyposmia may be helpful to differentiate between DIP and PD in the early stages.

23828833|t|PREDICT-PD: identifying risk of Parkinson's disease in the community: methods and baseline results.
23828833|a|OBJECTIVES: To present methods and baseline results for an online screening tool to identify increased risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) in the UK population. METHODS: Risk estimates for future PD were derived from the results of a systematic review of risk factors and early features of PD. Participants aged 60-80 years without PD were recruited by self-referral. They completed an online survey (including family history, non-motor symptoms and lifestyle factors), a keyboard-tapping task and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Risk scores were calculated based on survey answers. Preliminary support for the validity of this algorithm was assessed by comparing those estimated to be higher risk for PD with those at lower risk using proxies, including smell loss, REM-sleep behaviour disorder and reduced tapping speed, and by assessing associations in the whole group. RESULTS: 1324 eligible participants completed the survey and 1146 undertook the keyboard-tapping task. Smell tests were sent to 1065 participants. Comparing the 100 highest-risk participants and 100 lowest-risk participants, median University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test scores were 30/40 versus 33/40 (p<0.001), mean number of key taps in 30 s were 55 versus 58 (p=0.045), and 24% versus 10% scored above cut-off for REM-sleep behaviour disorder (p=0.008). Regression analyses showed increasing risk scores were associated with worse scores in the three proxies across the whole group (p<=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PREDICT-PD is the first study to systematically combine risk factors for PD in the general population. Validity to predict risk of PD will be tested through longitudinal follow-up of incident PD diagnosis.

23904197|t|Interneurons and beta-amyloid in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory tubercle in APPxPS1 transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease.
23904197|a|Impaired olfaction has been described as an early symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroanatomical changes underlying this deficit in the olfactory system are largely unknown. Given that interneuron populations are crucial in olfactory information processing, we have quantitatively analyzed somatostatin- (SOM), parvalbumin- (PV), and calretinin-expressing (CR) cells in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and olfactory tubercle in PS1 x APP double transgenic mice model of AD. The experiments were performed in wild type and double transgenic homozygous animal groups of 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age to analyze early stages of the pathology. In addition, beta-amyloid (Abeta) expression and its correlation with SOM cells have been quantified under confocal microscopy. The results indicate increasing expressions of Abeta with aging as well as an early fall of SOM and CR expression, whereas PV was decreased later in the disease progression. These observations evidence an early, preferential vulnerability of SOM and CR cells in rostral olfactory structures during AD that may be useful to unravel neural basis of olfactory deficits associated to this neurodegenerative disorder.

23932763|t|The olfactory system.
23932763|a|Any dysfunction in olfaction requires a radiological exploration comprising the nasal cavity, the anterior base of the skull, in particular the frontal and temporal lobes. MRI is the reference examination, due to the frontal plane and the T1, T2 volume maps. In the child, aplasia of the olfactory bulbs falls within a polymalformation (CHARGE) or endocrine (Kallman) context. In the adult, rhino sinus disease and meningiomas are the most common etiologies. Frontal or temporal impairment: tumoral or vascular and neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's disease) may accompany a loss of olfaction.

24035915|t|Dose-dependent improvements in learning and memory deficits in APPPS1-21 transgenic mice treated with the orally active Abeta toxicity inhibitor SEN1500.
24035915|a|In the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, accumulation of Abeta1-42 peptides is suggested to initiate a cascade of pathological events. To date, no treatments are available that can reverse or delay AD-related symptoms in patients. In the current study, we introduce a new Abeta toxicity inhibitor, SEN1500, which in addition to its block effect on Abeta1-42 toxicity in synaptophysin assays, can be administered orally and cross the blood-brain barrier without adverse effects in mice. In a different set of animals, APPPS1-21 mice were fed with three different doses of SEN1500 (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) for a period of 5 months. Cognition was assessed in a variety of behavioral tests (Morris water maze, social recognition, conditioned taste aversion and passive avoidance). Results suggest a positive effect on cognition with 20 mg/kg SEN1500 compared to control APPPS1-21 mice. However, no changes in soluble or insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were detected in the brains of SEN1500-fed mice. SEN1500 also attenuated the effect of Abeta1-42 on synaptophysin levels in mouse cortical neurons, which indicated that the compound blocked the synaptic toxicity of Abeta1-42. In vitro and in vivo effects presented here suggest that SEN1500 could be an interesting AD therapeutic.

24252299|t|123I-MIBG cardiac uptake, smell identification and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT in the differential diagnosis between vascular parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease.
24252299|a|UNLABELLED: Vascular parkinsonism (VP) may occur as a distinct clinicopathological entity but the comorbid presence of vascular damage in Parkinson's disease (PD) is very frequent too. This differential diagnosis has therapeutic and prognostic implications but remains challenging as the usefulness of a number of supporting tools is still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the clinical value of cardiac (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) SPECT, olfactory function and (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT as supporting tools in the differential diagnosis between VP and PD. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 15 consecutive patients with suspected VP, 15 PD patients and 9 healthy subjects. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG SPECT (heart-to-mediastinum ratio) and olfactory testing (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test-UPSIT) were performed in all of them. (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT was performed in VP-suspected patients. RESULTS: Heart-to-mediatinum ratio was significant lower in suspected VP (mean 1.45) and PD (mean 1.16) compared to control group (mean 1.69) (p = 0.017 and p < 0.0001). VP patients presented a higher ratio than PD patients (p = 0.001). Control group presented a significant higher UPSIT score (mean 30.71) when compared to both VP (mean 18.33) and PD (mean 15.29) (p = 0.001 for both groups). Those VP with a cardiac (123)I-MIBG non suggestive of PD were more likely to have a higher UPSIT score (p = 0.006). (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging was heterogeneous (7/15 VP normal, 3/15 abnormal suggestive of PD and 5/15 abnormal but atypical for PD). CONCLUSIONS: The use of cardiac (123)I-MIBG SPECT and to a lesser extent UPSIT could assist the differential diagnosis between VP and PD in subjects in which the diagnosis remains uncertain despite (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging.

24413543|t|Possible link between Toxoplasma gondii and the anosmia associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
24413543|a|Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan infecting 30% to 50% of global human population. Recently, it was suggested that chronic latent neuroinflammation caused by the parasite may be responsible for the development of several neurodegenerative diseases manifesting with the loss of smell. Studies in animals inoculated with the parasite revealed cysts in various regions of the brain, including olfactory bulb. Development of behavioral changes was paralleled by the preferential persistence of cysts in defined anatomic structures of the brain, depending on the host, strain of the parasite, its virulence, and route of inoculation. Olfactory dysfunction reported in Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia was frequently associated with the significantly increased serum anti-T gondii immunoglobulin G antibody levels. Damage of the olfactory system may be also at least in part responsible for the development of depression because T gondii infection worsened mood in such patients, and the olfactory bulbectomized rat serves as a model of depression.

24495273|t|Taste-masked and affordable donepezil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablet as promising solution for non-compliance in Alzheimer's disease patients.
24495273|a|CONTEXT: Manufacturing process and superdisintegrants used in orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulation are often time discussed. However, the effect of suitable filler for ODT formulation is not explored thoroughly. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a novel taste masked and affordable donepezil hydrochloride ODT with fast disintegration time and stable to improve medication compliance of Alzheimer's disease patient. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The ODT was manufactured using simple wet-granulation method. Crospovidone XL-10 was used as superdisintegrant and optimization was done by comparing the effect of three grades of lactose monohydrate compound as filler: Starlac , Flowlac  and Tablettose . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Formulations containing higher amount of colloidal silicon dioxide showed increase in hardness, weight, disintegration time and wetting time after stability study. Formulation E which containing 50% of Starlac  was found with shortest in vitro disintegration time (21.7 +- 1.67 s), in vivo disintegration time (24.0 +- 1.05 s) and in vitro disintegration time in artificial salvia (22.5 +- 1.67 s). Physical stability studies at 40  C/75% RH for 6 months, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and X-ray diffraction results showed that the formulation was stable. The drug-released profile showed that 80% of donepezil hydrochloride was released within 1 min. A single-dose, fasting, four-period, seven-treatment, double-blinded study involving 16 healthy human volunteers was performed to evaluate the palatability of ODT. Formulation VII containing 10 mg of ammonium glycyrrhizinate was able to mask the bitter taste of the drug. CONCLUSION: The product has the potential to be commercialized and it might serve as solution for non-compliance among the Alzheimer's disease patients.

24554308|t|Olfactory bulb involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.
24554308|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mild cognitive impairment heralding its progression to dementia. The neuropathologic changes of olfactory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases may involve the olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb/tract, primary olfactory cortices, and their secondary targets. Olfactory dysfunction is related to deposition of pathological proteins, alpha-synuclein, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofilament protein in these areas, featured by neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies and neurites inducing a complex cascade of molecular processes including oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and cytosolic disruption of cellular processes leading to cell death. Damage to cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems is likely involved, since such damage is most marked in those diseases with severe anosmia. Recent studies of olfactory dysfunction have focused its potential as an early biomarker for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders and their disease progression. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on neuropathological and pathophysiological changes of the olfactory system in the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD and synucleinopathies. We also present neuropathological findings in the olfactory bulb and tract in a large autopsy cohort (n = 536, 57.8 % female, mean age 81.3 years). The severity of olfactory bulb HPtau, Abeta, and alphaSyn pathology correlated and increased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing neuritic Braak stages, Thal Abeta phases, and cerebral Lewy body pathology, respectively. Hence, further studies are warranted to investigate the potential role of olfactory biopsies (possibly restricted to the olfactory epithelium) in the diagnostic process of neurodegenerative diseases in particular in clinical drug trials to identify subjects showing early, preclinical stages of neurodegeneration and to stratify clinically impaired cohorts according to the underlying cerebral neuropathology.

24596271|t|Onset of hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24596271|a|The 5XFAD mice are an early-onset transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which amyloid plaques are first observed between two and four months of age in the cortical layer five and in the subiculum of the hippocampal formation. Although cognitive alterations have been described in these mice, there are no studies that focused on the onset of hippocampus-dependent memory deficits, which are a hallmark of the prodromal stage of AD. To identify when the first learning and memory impairments appear, 5XFAD mice of two, four, and six months of age were compared with their respective wild-type littermates using the olfactory tubing maze, which is a very sensitive hippocampal-dependent task. Deficits in learning and memory started at four months with a substantial increase at six months of age while no olfactory impairments were observed. The volumetric study using magnetic resonance imaging of the whole brain and specific areas (olfactory bulb, striatum, and hippocampus) did not reveal neuro-anatomical difference. Slight memory deficits appeared at 4 months of age in correlation with an increased astrogliosis and amyloid plaque formation. This early impairment in learning and memory related to the hippocampal dysfunction is particularly suited to assess preclinical therapeutic strategies aiming to delay or suppress the onset of AD.

25101541|t|Ethological endophenotypes are altered by elevated stress hormone levels in both Huntington's disease and wildtype mice.
25101541|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive, psychiatric, motor, neuroendocrine and peripheral dysfunctions. Symptom onset and progression can be closely modeled in HD transgenic mice, which facilitate the search for therapeutics and environmental modulators. In the first investigation of chronic stress in HD, we have previously shown that administering a moderate dose of the stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT) had no effect on short-term memory in wildtype (WT) mice but accelerated the onset of the impairment in male R6/1 HD mice. We now extend this investigation to ethological dysfunctions in HD, which we hypothesized to be more susceptible to CORT treatment compared to the same functions in WT littermates. Both genotypes consumed similar doses of CORT dissolved in drinking water across 6-14 weeks of age and were assessed for olfactory sensitivity, nest-building, saccharin preference as well as vocal responses to sociosexual stimuli. In female HD and WT mice, olfactory sensitivity and saccharin preference were reduced by 2 and 4 weeks of CORT, respectively. In males, there was no effect of CORT on saccharin preference, however the number of vocalizations to a female mouse was transiently increased by CORT-drinking, regardless of genotype. Nest-building was severely impaired in HD mice at an early age, but was unaffected by CORT. Our results suggest that the presence of the HD mutation had no bearing on CORT-induced effects at this dose, suggesting that even moderately elevated stress hormone levels can impair ethological behaviors in both the HD and healthy brain.

25228293|t|MRI study: objective olfactory function and CNS pathologies in patients with multiple sclerosis.
25228293|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease characterized by CNS lesions causing physical and cognitive impairment. Using psychophysical testing, an olfactory disorder is diagnosed in 15-38.5% of patients with MS. Olfactometry permits objective testing of the sensory nerve function. METHODS: The study looked at 20 patients with MS. Clinical, olfactory (chemosensory evoked potentials), and MRI data (volume of the bulbus olfactorius (BO), olfactory brain (OB), lesions in the CNS) were analyzed. RESULTS: 25 percent of patients were hyposmic, exhibiting higher OB lesion volumes and smaller bulb volumes. H2S and CO2 latencies and the BO volume (inversely) correlated with the volume and number of MS lesions of the olfactory brain in all patients. Patients with a smaller olfactory bulb volume exhibited longer H2S latencies (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: A relationship between olfactory bulb volume, olfactory brain lesion load, and objective olfactory function testing in MS patients was investigated in all patients. Our data shows that brain damage characteristic of MS, including reduced bulb volume, causes an increase in chemosensory potential latencies and an olfactory function deficit.

25270839|a|Among the main causes of olfactory disorders are chronic rhinosinusitis, head trauma, acute infections of the upper respiratory tract and neurodegenerative diseases. Olfactory disorders can impose major restrictions on our lives. Although there are numerous approaches for the therapy of olfactory disorders, double-blind comparison studies are needed to distinguish between the effects of these therapies and spontaneous remission of olfactory disorders. The most significant aspects of treatments seem to be anti-inflammatory measures and the regenerative capabilities of the olfactory neuroepithelium.

25283823|t|[A case of myasthenia gravis with invasive thymoma associated with diffuse panbronchiolitis, alopecia, dysgeusia, cholangitis and myositis].
25283823|a|A 43-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of diplopia, ptosis, and dysphagia that had begun three years previously. He was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG) and invasive thymoma and treated with corticosteroid, thymectomy, and radiation therapy. Ten years after the thymectomy, computed tomography (CT) showed metastasis of the thymoma in the left lower lobe of the lung. Two years after this recurrence, when the patient was 55, respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, persistent cough, and dyspnea appeared. Chronic sinusitis, diffuse centrilobular opacities on CT, and positivity for HLA-B54 led to a diagnosis of diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB). Despite treatment with clarithromycin, the respiratory symptoms worsened. The patient developed alopecia and body hair loss at the age of 56 followed by dysgeusia, cholangitis, and myositis with positivity for anti-Kv1.4 antibodies. Although treatment with an increased dose of corticosteroid improved hair loss, dysgeusia, cholangitis, and myositis, he died of progression of DPB and serious respiratory infection at the age of 58. In this case, various autoimmune disorders occurred together with MG as complications of thymoma. Although alopecia, dysgeusia, and myositis are already known as complications of MG associated with thymoma, cholangitis is not well-recognized since there have been few reports suggesting a causal relationship between cholangitis and thymoma. Furthermore, DPB caused by immunodeficiency and respiratory tract hypersensitivity associated with thymoma and HLA-B54, respectively, is the distinctive feature of our case. Neurologists should be aware that various organs can be damaged directly and indirectly by abnormal T cells from thymoma in patients with MG.

25510818|t|Biomarkers of Parkinson's disease: present and future.
25510818|a|Sporadic or idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder of unknown origin that ranks only second behind Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prevalence and its consequent social and economic burden. PD neuropathology is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta; however, more widespread involvement of other CNS structures and peripheral tissues now is widely documented. The onset of molecular and cellular neuropathology of PD likely occurs decades before the onset of the motor symptoms characteristic of PD. The hallmark symptoms of PD, resting tremors, rigidity and postural disabilities, are related to dopamine (DA) deficiency. Current therapies treat these symptoms by replacing or boosting existing DA. All current interventions have limited therapeutic benefit for disease progression because damage likely has progressed over an estimated period of ~5 to 15years to a loss of 60%-80% of the nigral DA neurons, before symptoms emerge. There is no accepted definitive biomarker of PD. An urgent need exists to develop early diagnostic biomarkers for two reasons: (1) to intervene at the onset of disease and (2) to monitor the progress of therapeutic interventions that may slow or stop the course of the disease. In the context of disease development, one of the promises of personalized medicine is the ability to predict, on an individual basis, factors contributing to the susceptibility for the development of a given disease. Recent advances in our understanding of genetic factors underlying or contributing to PD offer the potential for monitoring susceptibility biomarkers that can be used to identify at-risk individuals and possibly prevent the onset of disease through treatment. Finally, the exposome concept is new in the biomarker discovery arena and it is suggested as a way to move forward in identifying biomarkers of neurological diseases. It is a two-stage scheme involving a first stage of exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) to profile omic features in serum to discover molecular biomarkers. The second stage involves application of this knowledge base in follow-up studies. This strategy is unique in that it promotes the use of data-driven (omic) strategies in interrogating diseased and healthy populations and encourages a movement away from using only reductionist strategies to discover biomarkers of exposure and disease. In this short review we will examine 1) advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PD that have led to candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment efficacy and 2) new technologies on the horizon that will lead to novel approaches in biomarker development.

25569294|t|An algorithmic approach to the evaluation and treatment of olfactory disorders.
25569294|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current evidence in diagnosing olfactory disorders and suggest an algorithmic approach to patients with relevant complaints. RECENT FINDINGS: New literature suggests that the incidence of olfactory loss increases with age. Age-associated olfactory loss is often multifactorial and requires careful history and physical exam. Psychophysical tests have a role in screening patients at risk for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, but there is lack of evidence regarding timing and patient selection. Prediction of olfactory improvement in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is difficult with variable results from different studies. Olfactory training is suggested to be an emerging modality in patients with postinfectious olfactory loss. SUMMARY: There is no standard treatment for olfactory loss. Each patient must be approached individually based on the suspected cause. Patients with CRS may require medical management and surgical treatment for alleviation of their olfactory dysfunction.

25914172|t|Coadministration of hydroxysafflor yellow A with levodopa attenuates the dyskinesia.
25914172|a|Levodopa (L-DOPA) is used as the most effective drug available for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, long-term treatment of L-DOPA frequently causes complications, including abnormal involuntary movements such as dyskinesia and response fluctuations in PD patients. In the present work, we investigated whether hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) ameliorates L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of PD. Valid PD rats were treated daily with vehicle, HSYA alone, L-DOPA, or a combination of HSYA plus L-DOPA for 21days, respectively. L-DOPA (8mg/kg) and benserazide (15mg/kg) were treated intraperitoneally. HSYA was administrated intraperitoneally at a dose of 10mg/kg. The abnormal involuntary movements and rotational behavior were evaluated. The expression of the dopamine D3 receptor in the striatum was also assayed. The results demonstrated that daily administration of L-DOPA to PD rats for 21days induced a steady expression of dyskinesia. Coadministration of HSYA with L-DOPA significantly ameliorated L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The combination treatment also prevented the shortening of the motor response duration that defines wearing off motor fluctuations. HSYA also inhibited the increase of expression of the dopamine D3 receptor in the striatum. These findings demonstrated that HSYA provided anti-dyskinetic relief against L-DOPA in a preclinical model of PD via regulating the expression of the dopamine D3 receptor. The combination of L-DOPA and HSYA also reduced the likelihood of wearing off development, and may thus support the utility of such compounds for the improved treatment of PD.

25929658|t|Prevalence and timeline of nonmotor symptoms in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
25929658|a|Parkinson disease (PD) patients may experience nonmotor symptoms (NMS) before Parkinsonism onset. Patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) eventually develop PD and may represent premotor PD. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and perceived timeline of NMS in IRBD through validated scales and questionnaires used in PD research. In 44 IRBD patients and 40 matched controls, overall NMS evaluation was assessed by NMS questionnaire for Parkinson disease, olfaction by University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, dysautonomia by scales for outcomes in Parkinson's disease-autonomic, constipation by Rome III criteria, depression by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, cognitive impairment by Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and hypersomnia by Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Patients were asked to report the perceived time of onset of hyposmia, constipation, and depression. Hyposmia (52.3 vs. 20.0 %, p = 0.002) and constipation (56.8 vs. 20.0 %, p = 0.001) were more frequent in patients than in controls. Patients reported more memory problems and showed a trend toward lower score in MoCA. Depression and hypersomnia were not more frequent in patients. The first symptom perceived was RBD in 38.6 % patients, hyposmia in 15.9 %, constipation in 11.4 %, and depression in 6.8 %. The temporal course of the NMS studied was heterogeneous. The three most common presentations were RBD followed by hyposmia; hyposmia followed by RBD; and hyposmia followed by RBD and constipation occurring at the same time span. IRBD patients frequently exhibit NMS that occur in premotor PD, particularly hyposmia and constipation. In IRBD, the perceived timeline of NMS is highly variable. This variability may suggest that pathological changes occurring in IRBD subjects are also heterogeneous and not restricted to the structures that regulate REM sleep.

26293177|t|Cognition in individuals at risk for Parkinson's: Parkinson associated risk syndrome (PARS) study findings.
26293177|a|OBJECTIVES: The Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome Study identified a cohort of healthy adults with hyposmia and dopamine transporter binding reduction to characterize individuals at risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). We describe the cognitive profile of this cohort. METHODS: Individuals older than 50 y without PD were recruited. Two hundred twenty-five completed cognitive testing and were included in the final analysis. A neuropsychological test battery was administered and normative scores created for global cognition, memory, executive function/working memory, processing speed/attention, visuospatial abilities, and language domains. Other non-motor symptoms (constipation, depression, anxiety, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) were assessed through questionnaires. RESULTS: Individuals with both hyposmia and reduced dopamine transporter binding (n = 38) had lower mean scores for global cognition, executive function/working memory, and memory compared with all other participants (n = 187). In separate multivariate logistic regression models, lower global cognition (odds ratio, 1.97, P = 0.004), and specifically executive function/working memory (odds ratio, 1.84, P = 0.004) scores were associated with membership in the hyposmia with dopamine transporter reduction group. Combining hyposmia with relative impairment on specific cognitive domains increased the odds of dopamine transporter binding reduction compared with hyposmia alone, with the greatest increase in odds for hyposmia plus executive function/working memory relative impairment (68% increase in odds from 4.14 to 6.96). CONCLUSION: Changes in global cognitive abilities, and specifically executive function/working memory, are present in individuals at risk for PD. Combining non-motor features, including cognition, improves prediction of dopamine transporter binding reduction.

26946629|t|Ocular myasthenia gravis accompanied by anosmia.
26946629|a|We report a case of ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) accompanied by anosmia. A 76-year-old man had idiopathic anosmia of 2-year duration. Four months before consultation, he began to have drooping in the right upper eyelid along with muscle soreness, distension, and pain in the nape. His tongue was dark-red with a thin and white coating; his pulse was wiry and slippery. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, eyelid drooping and anosmia are the main signs of liver constraint and spleen deficiency. In Western Medicine, the diagnosis was ocular MG and idiopathic anosmia. Our patient, along with the literature, suggests that anosmia may be an early symptom before MG. MG accompanied by anosmia could be a special subtype of MG according to antibody production and symptoms.

27483429|t|Odor Identification Test in Idiopathic REM-Behavior Disorder and Parkinson's Disease in China.
27483429|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), which is a risk factor in the development of PD. However, a few studies have conflicting results when comparing dysosmia in the patients with iRBD and PD. There is no study investigating the olfactory function in Chinese patients with iRBD. Additionally, the Sniffin' Sticks screening 12 test (SS-12) contains several odors that are not familiar to people in different cultures. METHODS: Odor identification was evaluated in iRBD patients (n = 54), PD patients (n = 54) and healthy controls (n = 54). With the identification data, a brief odor identification test was established and then validated in other subjects. RESULTS: Odor identification scores in iRBD patients were significantly higher than those in PD patients (P<0.001) but lower than those in controls (P<0.001). At the cut-off value of 7.5, the Sniffin' Sticks clearly differentiated iRBD and PD patients from the controls, and the brief test could increase the specificity in diagnosing PD. Neither the Sniffin' Sticks nor the brief test could clearly differentiate PD and iRBD patients from each other. CONCLUSIONS: Olfaction is more impaired in PD patients than in iRBD patients, possibly due to the heterogeneity of iRBD patients. The Sniffin' Sticks could be a useful tool for differentiating iRBD patients from the healthy population, and it could be useful for screening people at high-risk of PD in China, especially when combined with polysomnography. To reduce the expense and time required for the Sniffin' Sticks test, this study shows that a brief test is feasible.

27686631|t|DNA polymerase beta decrement triggers death of olfactory bulb cells and impairs olfaction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
27686631|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves the progressive degeneration of neurons critical for learning and memory. In addition, patients with AD typically exhibit impaired olfaction associated with neuronal degeneration in the olfactory bulb (OB). Because DNA base excision repair (BER) is reduced in brain cells during normal aging and AD, we determined whether inefficient BER due to reduced DNA polymerase-beta (Polbeta) levels renders OB neurons vulnerable to degeneration in the 3xTgAD mouse model of AD. We interrogated OB histopathology and olfactory function in wild-type and 3xTgAD mice with normal or reduced Polbeta levels. Compared to wild-type control mice, Polbeta heterozygous (Polbeta+/- ), and 3xTgAD mice, 3xTgAD/Polbeta+/- mice exhibited impaired performance in a buried food test of olfaction. Polbeta deficiency did not affect the proliferation of OB neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone. However, numbers of newly generated neurons were reduced by approximately 25% in Polbeta+/- and 3xTgAD mice, and by over 60% in the 3xTgAD/Polbeta+/- mice compared to wild-type control mice. Analyses of DNA damage and apoptosis revealed significantly greater degeneration of OB neurons in 3xTgAD/Polbeta+/- mice compared to 3xTgAD mice. Levels of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) accumulation in the OB were similar in 3xTgAD and 3xTgAD/Polbeta+/- mice, and cultured Polbeta-deficient neurons exhibited increased vulnerability to Abeta-induced death. Olfactory deficit is an early sign in human AD, but the mechanism is not yet understood. Our findings in a new AD mouse model demonstrate that diminution of BER can endanger OB neurons, and suggest a mechanism underlying early olfactory impairment in AD.

27772753|t|Antioxidant and inflammatory biomarkers for the identification of prodromal Parkinson's disease.
27772753|a|OBJECTIVES: We explored the role of oxidative stress and inflammatory molecules as potential Parkinson (PD) biomarkers and correlated biological with non-motor abnormalities (olfactory impairment and dysautonomia), in patients with idiopathic REM behavior disorder (iRBD) (prodromal PD) and established PD. METHODS: We recruited 11 iRBD and 15 patients with idiopathic PD (Hohen&Yahr 1-3, on L-DOPA and dopamine agonists combination therapy) and 12 age- and sex-matched controls (CTRL). We measured total olfactory score (TOS), autonomic function [deep breathing (DB), lying to standing (LS) and Valsalva manoeuvre (VM) ratios], blood reduced glutathione (Br-GSH), oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (neopterin). RESULTS: Anosmia was similarly prevalent in iRBD (36%) and PD (33%) patients, but absent in CTRL. Orthostatic hypotension was more common among iRBD (73%) and PD (60%) than in CTRL (25%). By univariable ordinal logistic regression, TOS, Br-GSH, LS and VM ratio worsened from CTRL to iRBD and PD groups. Only reduced Br-GSH levels (p=0.037, OR=0.994; 95%CI 0.988-1.000) were independently associated to PD. TOS correlated with Br-GSH (R=0.34, p=0.037), VM ratio (R=0.43, p=0.015), and neopterin (rho=0.39, p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced systemic antioxidant capacity is found in prodromal and overt PD and may represent, in association with olfactory loss and cardiovascular dysautonomia, a useful biomarker for an integrative, early diagnosis of PD.

27780720|t|Unilateral olfactory sensitivity in multiple sclerosis.
27780720|a|It is not known whether lateralized olfactory sensitivity deficits are present in MS. Since projections from the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex are largely ipsilateral, and since both functional imaging and psychophysical studies suggest that the right side of the brain may be more involved in olfactory processing than the left, we addressed this issue by administering well-validated tests of odor detection, along with tests of odor identification, to each side of the nose of 73 MS patients and 73 age-, gender-, and race-matched normal controls. We also determined, in 63 of the MS patients, whether correlations were present between the olfactory test measures and MRI-determined lesions in brain regions ipsilateral and contralateral to the nose side that was tested. No significant left:right differences in either olfactory sensitivity or identification were present, although in both cases mean performance was lower in the MS than in the control subjects (ps<0.0001). Scores on the two sides of the nose were positively correlated with one another (threshold r=0.56, p<0.0001; Identification r=0.71, p<0.0001). The percent of MS patients whose bilateral test scores fell below the 10th percentile of controls did not differ between the odor identification and detection threshold tests. Both left and right odor identification and detection test scores were weakly correlated with lesion volumes in temporal and frontal lobe brain regions (r's<0.40). Our findings demonstrate that MS does not differentially influence odor perception on left and right sides of the nose, regardless of whether sensitivity or identification is being measured. They also indicate that tests of odor identification and detection are similarly influenced by MS and that such influences are associated with central brain lesions.

27802235|t|Mitochondrial Abnormalities and Synaptic Loss Underlie Memory Deficits Seen in Mouse Models of Obesity and Alzheimer's Disease.
27802235|a|Obesity is associated with impaired memory in humans, and obesity induced by high-fat diets leads to cognitive deficits in rodents and in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear how high-fat diets contribute to memory impairment. Therefore, we tested the effect of a high-fat diet on memory in male and female control non-transgenic (Non-Tg) and triple-transgenic AD (3xTgAD) mice and determined if a high-fat diet caused similar ultrastructural abnormalities to those observed in AD. Behavior was assessed in mice on control or high-fat diet at 4, 8, or 14 months of age and ultrastructural analysis at 8 months of age. A high-fat diet increased body weight, fat weight, and insulin levels with some differences in these metabolic responses observed between Non-Tg and 3xTgAD mice. In both sexes, high-fat feeding caused memory impairments in Non-Tg mice and accelerated memory deficits in 3xTgAD mice. In 3xTgAD mice, changes in hippocampal mitochondrial morphology were observed in capillaries and brain neuropil that were accompanied by a reduction in synapse number. A high-fat diet also caused mitochondria abnormalities and a reduction in synapse number in Non-Tg mice, but did not exacerbate the changes seen in 3xTgAD mice. Our data demonstrate that a high-fat diet affected memory in Non-Tg mice and produced similar impairments in mitochondrial morphology and synapse number comparable to those seen in AD mice, suggesting that the detrimental effects of a high-fat diet on memory might be due to changes in mitochondrial morphology leading to a reduction in synaptic number.

27812756|t|A prospective evaluation of taste in Parkinson's disease.
27812756|a|It is well known that Parkinson's disease is characterized by a variety of non-motor symptoms. A gustatory deficit is hypothesized to be one of them although few and only cross-sectional studies are available. The aim of our pilot study was to prospectively investigate the taste function in Parkinson's disease patients after some years from the first evaluation (mean follow-up 4.35 +- 0.49 years; time range 3.5-5.6 years). A group of 26 patients was re-examined (16 males and 10 females; mean age 70.9 +- 8.4 years, range 54-88 years). Taste function was assessed in one session, by means of the Whole Mouth Test (WMT) and Taste Strips Test (TST). Olfaction was also evaluated with the Sniffin' Sticks Identification Test (SST). All these tests are commercially available (Burghart Company, Germany). All patients were able to understand and complete the procedure. Although scores decreased over time, no significant difference was found between global taste scores of first and second evaluation, neither comparing every single taste quality (WMT: p = 0.234, Mann-Whitney U test; TST: p = 0.747, Mann-Whitney U test; McNemar chi-square in the range of 0-1.455). These results confirm a persistent but slight and stable taste impairment, in patients with Parkinson's disease. Future studies on a much larger sample of patients are certainly required.

28011307|t|The olfactory bulb as the entry site for prion-like propagation in neurodegenerative diseases.
28011307|a|Olfactory deficits are present in numerous neurodegenerative disorders and are accompanied by pathology in related brain regions. In several of these disorders, olfactory disturbances appear early and are considered as prodromal symptoms of the disease. In addition, pathological protein aggregates affect olfactory regions prior to other regions, suggesting that the olfactory system might be particularly vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases. Exposed to the external environment, the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb allow pathogen and toxin penetration into the brain, a process that has been proposed to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases. Determining whether the olfactory bulb could be a starting point of pathology and of pathology spread is crucial to understanding how neurodegenerative diseases evolve. We argue that pathological changes following environmental insults contribute to the initiation of protein aggregation in the olfactory bulb, which then triggers the spread of the pathology within the brain by a templating mechanism in a prion-like manner. We review the evidence for the early involvement of olfactory structures in neurodegenerative diseases and the relationship between neuropathology and olfactory function. We discuss the vulnerability and putative underlying mechanisms by which pathology could be initiated in the olfactory bulb, from the entry of pathogens (promoted by increased permeability of the olfactory epithelium with aging or inflammation) to the sensitivity of the olfactory system to oxidative stress and inflammation. Finally, we review changes in protein expression and neural excitability triggered by pathogenic proteins that can promote pathogenesis in the olfactory bulb and beyond.

28276076|t|Managing the oral side-effects of medications used to treat multiple sclerosis.
28276076|a|BACKGROUND: Many medications used to manage multiple sclerosis (MS) affect oral health. This review aimed to identify the oral side-effects of the current drugs recommended in Australia to treat MS and make dental practitioners aware of the range of symptoms. METHODS: The Australian Therapeutic Guidelines and the Australian Medicines Handbook were searched for medications used to treat MS. For each medication, the generic name, class, route of administration, dosage and drug company reported side-effects were extracted from the online Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMs) database. Meyler's Side-effect of Drugs Encyclopaedia was used to identify any additional oral adverse reactions to medications used to treat MS. RESULTS: Fourteen drugs were identified for the treatment of MS progression and 13 drugs for the treatment of MS symptoms. For these medications, 18 oral side-effects were documented: xerostomia was the most common, followed by dysgeusia, dysphagia, mouth ulceration and sinusitis. Anticholinergic drugs caused xerostomia while immunosuppressants resulted in more infection-related side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: Dental practitioners should be aware of the range of symptoms likely to be reported by this population. Clinicians are encouraged to continue providing dental care for their patients who develop MS and refer complex cases to specialists.

28424392|t|[The Role of Brodmann Area 12: Taste, Social Cognition, and Mental Time].
28424392|a|Broadman area 12, together with area 11, is located in the orbitofrontal area. A voxel-based morphometric (VBM) study revealed the association between bilateral brodmann areas 12/47 and taste disturbance in individuals with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In our VBM study in patients with Parkinson's disease, decision-making impairments were associated with atrophy of the bilateral Brodmann area 12, indicating that this area may play an important role in social cognitive function. Our recent study also demonstrated that this area may serve as time order judgement or mental time travel.

28595287|t|Conversion to Parkinson Disease in the PARS Hyposmic and Dopamine Transporter-Deficit Prodromal Cohort.
28595287|a|Importance: Detecting individuals at risk for Parkinson disease (PD) during the prodromal phase could clarify disease mechanisms and allow for treatment earlier in the disease process to possibly slow or prevent the onset of motor PD. Objective: To determine if the combination of smell identification testing followed by dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging can accurately and efficiently identify individuals from the general population at risk for conversion to a clinical diagnosis of PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Participants were identified from the community by olfactory testing assessed longitudinally with DAT imaging 2 and 4 years after baseline and by annual clinical follow-up to determine whether they had clinical evidence to establish a PD diagnosis. Participants were contacted by mail and completed olfactory testing at home. Longitudinal follow-up of clinical measures and DAT imaging occurred at specialty centers. There were 203 hyposmic and 100 normosmic participants. A total of 185 hyposmic and 95 normosmic individuals had at least 1 follow-up visit, and 152 hyposmic participants (82.2%) were either observed for 4 years or converted to PD during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: Percentage of individuals with hyposmia and a DAT deficit that converted to PD and the change in PD clinical scale scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and DAT imaging during 4-year follow-up. Results: Of 280 total participants, 140 (50.0%) were male, and the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 63 (8.7) years. Among 21 participants with hyposmia and a DAT deficit (65% or less of age-expected lowest putamen binding ratio) at baseline, 14 (67%) converted to PD at 4 years compared with 2 of 22 participants (9%) with a DAT in an indeterminate range (greater than 65%-80%) and 3 of 109 participants (2.8%) with no DAT deficit (greater than 80%) at baseline. Individuals with a baseline DAT deficit experienced a 4-year decline in DAT binding of 20.23% (SD, 15.04%) compared with 3.68% (SD, 18.36%) and 5.45% (SD, 13.58%) for participants with an indeterminate and no DAT deficit, respectively (P = .002). The relative risk of conversion to a diagnosis of PD in hyposmic individuals with a DAT deficit was 17.47 (95% CI, 7.02-43.45) compared with individuals with either indeterminate or no DAT deficit. Conclusions and Relevance: The combination of hyposmia and DAT deficit was highly predictive of conversion to PD within 4 years of clinical follow-up. Individuals with hyposmia and a DAT deficit had a 5% reduction in DAT binding annually, similar to early PD. These results provide a framework for planning disease prevention studies in PD.

28668282|t|Brain infusion of alpha-synuclein oligomers induces motor and non-motor Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in mice.
28668282|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor dysfunction, which is preceded by a number of non-motor symptoms including olfactory deficits. Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) gives rise to Lewy bodies in dopaminergic neurons and is thought to play a central role in PD pathology. However, whether amyloid fibrils or soluble oligomers of alpha-syn are the main neurotoxic species in PD remains controversial. Here, we performed a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of alpha-syn oligomers (alpha-SYOs) in mice and evaluated motor and non-motor symptoms. Familiar bedding and vanillin essence discrimination tasks showed that alpha-SYOs impaired olfactory performance of mice, and decreased TH and dopamine levels in the olfactory bulb early after infusion. The olfactory deficit persisted until 45days post-infusion (dpi). alpha- SYO-infused mice behaved normally in the object recognition and forced swim tests, but showed increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze tests 20 dpi. Finally, administration of alpha-SYOs induced late motor impairment in the pole test and rotarod paradigms, along with reduced TH and dopamine content in the caudate putamen, 45 dpi. Reduced number of TH-positive cells was also seen in the substantia nigra of alpha-SYO-injected mice compared to control. In conclusion, i.c.v. infusion of alpha-SYOs recapitulated some of PD-associated non-motor symptoms, such as increased anxiety and olfactory dysfunction, but failed to recapitulate memory impairment and depressive-like behavior typical of the disease. Moreover, alpha-SYOs i.c.v. administration induced motor deficits and loss of TH and dopamine levels, key features of PD. Results point to alpha-syn oligomers as the proximal neurotoxins responsible for early non-motor and motor deficits in PD and suggest that the i.c.v. infusion model characterized here may comprise a useful tool for identification of PD novel therapeutic targets and drug screening.

28944467|t|Olfactory Dysfunction Predicts Subsequent Dementia in Older U.S. Adults.
28944467|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and subsequent diagnosis of dementia. DESIGN: Longitudinal study of a population representative of U.S. older adults. SETTING: Home interviews (National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project). PARTICIPANTS: Men and women aged 57 to 85 (N = 2,906). MEASUREMENTS: Objective odor identification ability was measured at baseline using a validated five-item test. Five years later, the respondent, or a proxy if the respondent was too sick to interview or had died, reported physician diagnosis of dementia. The association between baseline olfactory dysfunction and an interval dementia diagnosis was tested using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, comorbidities (modified Charlson Comorbidity Index), and cognition at baseline (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire). RESULTS: Older adults with olfactory dysfunction had more than twice the odds of having developed dementia 5 years later (odds ratio = 2.13, 95% confidence interval = 1.32-3.43), controlling for the above covariates. Having more odor identification errors was associated with greater probability of an interval dementia diagnosis (P = .04, 1-degree of freedom linear-trend test). CONCLUSION: We show for the first time in a nationally representative sample that home-dwelling older adults with normal cognition and difficulty identifying odors face higher odds of being diagnosed with dementia 5 years later, independent of other significant risk factors. This validated five-item odor identification test is an efficient, low-cost component of the physical examination that can provide useful information while assessing individuals' risk of dementia. Use of such testing may provide an opportunity for early interventions to reduce the attendant morbidity and public health burden of dementia.

29297712|t|Comparison of olfactory function between neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis.
29297712|a|OBJECTIVES: Olfactory dysfunction (ODF) has been reported in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the comparison of olfactory function and olfactory-related gray matter (GM) between patients with NMO and MS needed to be further elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with NMO and 37 with MS were enrolled. Olfactory function was evaluated with a Japanese T&T olfactometer test kit, and the neuroanatomical features of olfactory-related GM were assessed using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Olfactory deficits were found in 51.4% of patients with NMO and 40.5% of patients with MS. Patients with NMO with ODF had significantly smaller olfactory bulbs than patients with MS with ODF (p = 0.031). Olfactory-related GM atrophy was found in patients with NMO in several regions of the right orbitofrontal cortex and right superior frontal gyrus; in patients with MS, reduced GM volume was found in the right parahippocampal gyrus and piriform cortex (p < 0.05, cluster size > 200 voxels). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory deficits are common in both NMO and MS. However, the neuroanatomical features related to olfactory deficits differ greatly between the two diseases.

29458280|t|Depressive Symptoms Are Associated With Color Vision but not Olfactory Function in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.
29458280|a|Depressive symptoms and sensory dysfunction, such as reduction in visual and olfactory function, are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have suggested that depressive symptoms are associated with visual impairments and potentially with hyposmia in several types of mood disorders. However, the relationship between depressive symptoms and sensory dysfunction remains unclear in PD. To examine the association of depressive symptoms with color vision and olfactory function in PD, the authors conducted a cross-sectional study in 159 patients with PD. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30); color vision was tested with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test (FMT); and olfactory function was tested with the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 Test. Results showed that the total error score (TES) for the FMT was significantly and independently correlated with scores on both the BDI-II and GDS-30 in a positive manner, suggesting that more severe depressive symptoms are associated with poorer color vision in PD. In addition, both somatic and effective subscores for the BDI-II were correlated with the TES on the FMT, while no significant correlation was observed between total scores on the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 Test and BDI-II or GDS-30. The decrease in color vision but not olfactory function was found to be associated with the severity of depressive symptoms in PD patients, supporting the idea that the occurrence of depressive symptoms in PD is linked with disruption of the visual system.

29709137|t|Smell functions in patients with multiple sclerosis: a prospective case-control study.
29709137|a|Smell functions in patients with multiple sclerosis: a prospective case-control study. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the smell function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Twenty subjects (six males, 14 females) who were diagnosed as having MS, based on the 2010 Revised McDonald criteria, and 20 healthy individuals (six males, 14 females) were included in this study. In order to measure smell identification abilities, each subject completed the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Central and peripheral regions of smell were measured using cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images. The central regions of smell (the temporal lobe insular gyrus and the corpus amygdala) and the peripheral regions of smell (the olfactory bulb, tract and sulcus) were examined in the cranial MR images. Regions of smell were also evaluated for the presence of MS lesions (plaques). RESULTS: The total BSIT scores of the subjects in the MS group were found to be significantly lower than those of the control group (p<0.05). In the MS group, measurement values of the central regions of smell (right corpus amygdala diameter, right and left corpus amygdala) were significantly higher than those of the control group (p<0.05). There were no MS 'lesions in the peripheral regions of smell, but MS lesions were observed in the central regions: the right temporal lobe insular gyrus (four patients, 20.0%); the left temporal lobe insular gyrus (two patients, 10.0%); and the right corpus amygdala (one patient, 5.0%). While these results are not sufficient for statistical analysis, the total smell scores of these patients were found to be low. CONCLUSION: There is a deterioration in the smell functions of patients with MS. Therefore, we highly recommend that ENT specialists use the easily accessible and reliable BSIT for the diagnosis of smell disorders.

29976255|t|Ablation of tau causes an olfactory deficit in a murine model of Parkinson's disease.
29976255|a|Parkinson's disease is diagnosed upon the presentation of motor symptoms, resulting from substantial degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Prior to diagnosis, there is a lengthy prodromal stage in which non-motor symptoms, including olfactory deficits (hyposmia), develop. There is limited information about non-motor impairments and there is a need for directed research into these early pathogenic cellular pathways that precede extensive dopaminergic death in the midbrain. The protein tau has been identified as a genetic risk factor in the development of sporadic PD. Tau knockout mice have been reported as an age-dependent model of PD, and this study has demonstrated that they develop motor deficits at 15-months-old. We have shown that at 7-month-old tau knockout mice present with an overt hyposmic phenotype. This olfactory deficit correlates with an accumulation of alpha-synuclein, as well as autophagic impairment, in the olfactory bulb. This pathological feature becomes apparent in the striatum and substantia nigra of 15-month-old tau knockout mice, suggesting the potential for a spread of disease. Initial primary cell culture experiments have demonstrated that ablation of tau results in the release of alpha-synuclein enriched exosomes, providing a potential mechanism for disease spread. These alterations in alpha-synuclein level as well as a marked autophagy impairment in the tau knockout primary cells recapitulate results seen in the animal model. These data implicate a pathological role for tau in early Parkinson's disease.

The second aim is to evaluate the changes of QoL following the use of a specific device that provides food flavour. Thirty-two ALS patients were recruited and divided into two groups: subjects feeding only through enteral tube (ET) and subjects still eating by oral way (OW). A specific set of questionnaires was selected and adapted to investigate possible changes of taste and the impact on psychological status and QoL. Moreover, a specific device that provides food flavours in a safety manner was applied to all patients. We found a perceived reduction of taste in ALS patients, in particular in the ET group. All patients showed a strong interest in the preservation of taste, and its loss negatively related to their QoL. The use of the flavour device improved the perceived QoL showing no side effects, even in the ET group. For the first time, our study revealed changes in taste perception in a cohort of ALS patients and the negative consequences that these changes have on psychological status and QoL. Furthermore, the positive effects of the device used to provide flavours suggest a possible rehabilitative effect, which should be better evaluated and confirmed in further studies.

31076272|t|Clinical practice guidelines for the management of olfactory dysfunction - Secondary publication.
31076272|a|OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-based recommendation for the management of olfactory dysfunction in accordance with the consensus reached by the Subcommittee of the Japanese Clinical Practice Guideline for olfactory dysfunction in the Japanese Rhinologic Society. METHODS: Seven clinical questions (CQs) regarding the management of olfactory dysfunction were formulated by the subcommittee of the Japanese Clinical Practice Guideline for olfactory dysfunction. We searched the literature published between April 1990 and September 2014 using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Ichushi Web databases. The main search terms were "smell disorder," "olfactory dysfunction," "olfactory loss," "olfactory disturbance," "olfactory impairments," "olfaction disorder," "smell disorder," "anosmia," "cacosmia," and "dysosmia." Based on the results of the literature review and the expert opinion of the Subcommittee, 4 levels of recommendation, from A-strongly recommended to D-not recommended, were adopted for the management of olfactory dysfunction. RESULTS: Both oral and locally administered corticosteroids have been strongly recommended for patients with olfactory dysfunction due to chronic rhinosinusitis. Nasal steroid spray and antihistamine drugs have been moderately recommended for patients with allergic rhinitis. Although no drugs have been deemed to be truly effective for post-viral olfactory dysfunction by randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) or placebo-controlled trials, olfactory training using odorants has been reported to be effective for improving olfactory function. There is considerable evidence that olfactory testing is useful for differential diagnosis, prediction of disease progression, and early detection of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The Clinical Practice Guideline has developed recommendations for the management of various aspects of olfactory dysfunction.

31703081|t|Olfactory screening of Parkinson's Disease patients and healthy subjects in China and Germany: A study of cross-cultural adaptation of the Sniffin' Sticks 12-identification test.
31703081|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory testing is a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Although fast and easy to use, the high intercultural variability of odor detection limits the world-wide use of the most common test sets. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test one of the most commonly used olfactory tests (Sniffin' Sticks 12-identification test) in an adapted version for a Chinese population of healthy subjects and PD patients. METHODS: For this purpose, cohorts of 39 Chinese and 41 German PD patients as well as 70 Chinese and 100 German healthy subjects have been examined both with the original and the adapted version of the Sniffin' Sticks test, the latter being designed according to the regional culture. RESULTS: The adapted Chinese version of the Sniffin' Sticks 12 identification test proved to discriminate Chinese PD patients from controls with a high specificity but relatively low sensitivity. Yet not all odor exchanges would have been necessary as the original odors including liquorice and coffee showed an equally high identification rate in the Chinese and German cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the newly adapted test could be used as a screening test for PD related olfactory dysfunction in a Chinese population. However further investigation will be necessary to optimize the selection of odors for the Chinese version of the test.

31713727|t|VGF peptides as novel biomarkers in Parkinson's disease.
31713727|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). At disease onset, a diagnosis is often difficult. VGF peptides are abundant in the SN and peripheral circulation; hence, we investigate whether their plasma profile may reflect the brain dopamine reduction. Using antibodies against the VGF C-terminal portion, we analyzed the rat brain and human plasma, with immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Rats were unilaterally lesioned with 6-hyroxydopamine and sacrificed either 3 or 6 weeks later with or without levodopa treatment. Plasma samples were obtained from PD patients, either at the time of diagnosis (group 1, drug naive, n = 23) or upon dopamine replacement (group 2, 1-6 years, n = 24; group 3, > 6 years, n = 16), compared with age-matched control subjects (group 4, n = 21). Assessment of the olfactory function was carried out in group 2 using the "Sniffin' Sticks" test. VGF immunoreactivity was present in GABAergic neurons and, on the lesioned side, it was reduced at 3 weeks and abolished at 6 weeks after lesion. Conversely, upon levopoda, VGF labeling was restored. In PD patients, VGF levels were reduced at the time of diagnosis (1504 +- 587 vs. 643 +- 348 pmol/mL, means +- S.E.M: control vs. naive; p < 0.05) but were comparable with the controls after long-term drug treatment (> 6 years). A linear correlation was demonstrated between VGF immunoreactivity and disease duration, levodopa equivalent dose and olfactory dysfunction. Plasma VGF levels may represent a useful biomarker, especially in the early stages of PD.

31847534|t|Strategic Timing of Glial HMOX1 Expression Results in Either Schizophrenia-Like or Parkinsonian Behavior in Mice.
31847534|a|Aims: In this original research communication, we assess the impact of shifting the window of glial HMOX1 overexpression in mice from early-to-midlife to mid-to-late life, resulting in two disparate conditions modeling schizophrenia (SCZ) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Mesolimbic hyperdopaminergia is a widely accepted feature of SCZ, while nigrostriatal hypodopaminergia is the sine qua non of idiopathic PD. Although the advent of parkinsonian features in SCZ patients after treatment with antidopaminergic agents is intuitive, subtle features of parkinsonism commonly observed in young, drug-naive schizophrenics are not. Similarly, emergent psychosis in PD subjects receiving levodopa replacement is not unusual, whereas spontaneous hallucinosis in nonmedicated persons with idiopathic PD is enigmatic. Investigations using GFAP.HMOX1 mice may shed light on these clinical paradoxes. Results: Astroglial heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) overexpression in mice throughout embryogenesis until 6 or 12 months of age resulted in hyperdopaminergia, hyperkinesia/stereotypy ameliorated with clozapine, deficient prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, reduced preference for social novelty, impaired nest building, and cognitive dysfunction reminiscent of SCZ. On the contrary, astroglial HO-1 overexpression between 8.5 and 19 months of age yielded a PD-like behavioral phenotype with hypodopaminergia, altered gait, locomotor incoordination, and reduced olfaction. Innovation: We conjecture that region-specific disparities in the susceptibility of dopaminergic and other circuitry to the trophic and degenerative influences of glial HMOX1 induction may permit the concomitant expression of mixed SCZ and PD traits within affected individuals. Conclusion: Elucidation of these converging mechanisms may (i) help better understand disease pathogenesis and (ii) identify HO-1 as a potential therapeutic target in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

31935728|t|Inability to Smell Peppermint Is Related to Cognitive Decline: A Prospective Community-Based Study.
31935728|a|BACKGROUND: A few studies have demonstrated the association of poorer olfactory identification (OI) with poorer cognition in population-based cohorts. None of them considered the outcome associated with the inability to smell a certain odor. OBJECTIVE: To verify the hypothesis that at least one specific odor is associated with incident cognitive decline among older adults. METHODS: In the Shanghai Aging Study, a sub-cohort of 948 dementia-free participants who had baseline OI measurements were prospectively followed for 5 years. RESULTS: An inability to smell peppermint (beta = -0.44, p < 0.001), rose (beta = -0.14, p = 0.040), or coffee (beta = -0.37, p = 0.002) was inversely related to the annual rate of change in the Mini Mental State Examination score, and an inability to smell peppermint was associated with a higher risk for incident dementia (hazard ratio 2.67, 95% CI 1.44-4.96) after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that some odors, especially peppermint, might be considered as a potential predictor for dementia in older populations.

32087739|t|Taste and smell function in Wolfram syndrome.
32087739|a|BACKGROUND: Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes, optic nerve atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss and neurodegeneration. Although olfactory dysfunction, a classical clinical marker of neurodegenerative processes, has been reported in Wolfram syndrome, its use as a clinical marker in Wolfram is limited due to data scarcity. In addition, it is unknown whether Wolfram syndrome affects the sense of taste. METHODS: Smell and taste perception were assessed in participants with Wolfram syndrome (n = 40) who were 15.1 +- 6.0 years of age (range: 5.1-28.7 years) and two sex- and age-matched control groups: one group with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D; n = 25) and a healthy control group (HC; n = 29). Smell sensitivity was assessed by measuring n-butanol detection thresholds and smell identification by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Taste function was assessed using NIH Toolbox, which includes the assessment of sucrose (sweet) taste preference, and perceived intensity of sucrose, sodium chloride (salty), and quinine hydrochloride (bitter) both in the tip of the tongue (regional test) and the whole mouth. RESULTS: Smell sensitivity was not significantly different among groups; however, smell identification was impaired in Wolfram syndrome, as reflected by significantly lower UPSIT scores in Wolfram syndrome compared to HC and T1D (P < 0.001). Compared to participants in the control groups, participants with Wolfram syndrome had a blunted perception of sweetness and saltiness when taste stimuli were applied regionally (P < 0.05), but differences in perceived intensity were no longer significant among groups when taste stimuli were tasted with the whole mouth. Groups preferred similar sucrose concentrations. CONCLUSION: Wolfram syndrome was associated with olfactory dysfunction. However, the olfactory dysfunction was qualitative (related to smell identification) and not secondary to olfactory insensitivity or diabetes, suggesting is arising from dysfunction in central olfactory brain regions. In contrast to olfaction, and despite decreased perception of taste intensity in the anterior tongue, the sense of taste was overall well-conserved in individuals with Wolfram syndrome. Future longitudinal studies of taste and smell perception in Wolfram syndrome will be important to determine the use of the chemical senses as clinical markers of disease progression.

33160016|t|Tip60 protects against amyloid-beta-induced transcriptomic alterations via different modes of action in early versus late stages of neurodegeneration.
33160016|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder hallmarked by amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque accumulation, neuronal cell death, and cognitive deficits that worsen during disease progression. Histone acetylation dysregulation, caused by an imbalance between reduced histone acetyltransferases (HAT) Tip60 and increased histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) levels, can directly contribute to AD pathology. However, whether such AD-associated neuroepigenetic alterations occur in response to Abeta peptide production and can be protected against by increasing Tip60 levels over the course of neurodegenerative progression remains unknown. Here we profile Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 dynamics and transcriptome-wide changes across early and late stage AD pathology in the Drosophila brain produced solely by human amyloid-beta42. We show that early Abeta42 induction leads to disruption of Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance during early neurodegenerative stages preceding Abeta plaque accumulation that persists into late AD stages. Correlative transcriptome-wide studies reveal alterations in biological processes we classified as transient (early-stage only), late-onset (late-stage only), and constant (both). Increasing Tip60 HAT levels in the Abeta42 fly brain protects against AD functional pathologies that include Abeta plaque accumulation, neural cell death, cognitive deficits, and shorter life-span. Strikingly, Tip60 protects against Abeta42-induced transcriptomic alterations via distinct mechanisms during early and late stages of neurodegeneration. Our findings reveal distinct modes of neuroepigenetic gene changes and Tip60 neuroprotection in early versus late stages in AD that can serve as early biomarkers for AD, and support the therapeutic potential of Tip60 over the course of AD progression.

33167591|t|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Is Accompanied by Protein Derangements in the Olfactory Bulb-Tract Axis.
33167591|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive muscle paralysis due to the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Recent studies point out an involvement of the non-motor axis during disease progression. Despite smell impairment being considered a potential non-motor finding in ALS, the pathobiochemistry at the olfactory level remains unknown. Here, we applied an olfactory quantitative proteotyping approach to analyze the magnitude of the olfactory bulb (OB) proteostatic imbalance in ALS subjects (n = 12) with respect to controls (n = 8). Around 3% of the quantified OB proteome was differentially expressed, pinpointing aberrant protein expression involved in vesicle-mediated transport, macroautophagy, axon development and gliogenesis in ALS subjects. The overproduction of olfactory marker protein (OMP) points out an imbalance in the olfactory signal transduction in ALS. Accompanying the specific overexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Bcl-xL in the olfactory tract (OT), a tangled disruption of signaling routes was evidenced across the OB-OT axis in ALS. In particular, the OB survival signaling dynamics clearly differ between ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), two faces of TDP-43 proteinopathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on high-throughput molecular characterization of the olfactory proteostasis in ALS.

33459707|t|Lateralized Deficits in Motor, Sensory, and Olfactory Domains in Dementia.
33459707|a|BACKGROUND: There exist functional deficits in motor, sensory, and olfactory abilities in dementias. Measures of these deficits have been discussed as potential clinical markers. OBJECTIVE: We measured the deficit of motor, sensory, and olfactory functions on both the left and right body side, to study potential body lateralizations. METHODS: This IRB-approved study (N = 84) performed left/right clinical tests of gross motor (dynamometer test), sensory (Von Frey test), and olfactory (peppermint oil test) ability. The Mini-Mental Status Exam was administered to determine level of dementia; medical and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS: Sensory and olfactory deficits lateralized to the left side of the body, while motor deficits lateralized to the right side. We found clinical correlates of motor lateralization: female, depression, MMSE <15, and diabetes. While clinical correlates of sensory lateralization: use of psychotherapeutic agent, age >=85, MMSE <15, and male. Lastly, clinical correlates of olfactory lateralization: age <85, number of medications >10, and male. CONCLUSION: These lateralized deficits in body function can act as early clinical markers for improved diagnosis and treatment. Future research should identify correlates and corresponding therapies to strengthen at-risk areas.

33711397|t|Olfactory dysfunction predicts the development of dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes.
33711397|a|AIMS: Olfactory dysfunction is associated with the transition from normal cognition to dementia in persons without type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate whether olfactory dysfunction could be an early marker of future dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This exploratory study included 151 older Japanese outpatients with type 2 diabetes who did not have a diagnosis of probable dementia at baseline. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine whether Open Essence (OE) test score at baseline is associated with the development of probable dementia. RESULTS: Over 3 years, approximately 9% of the study subjects developed probable dementia. Subjects with olfactory dysfunction at baseline developed probable dementia more frequently than those without. Multivariate logistic regression showed that lower OE test score, higher age, lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, higher total protein concentration, and more frequent use of a sulfonylurea are significantly associated with the development of probable dementia. Stepwise multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that change in OE test score over 3 years is significantly associated with change in MMSE score. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that olfactory dysfunction precedes the development of probable dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes.

33908332|t|Clinicoradiological features in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with olfactory dysfunction.
33908332|a|Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron involvement. Although olfactory dysfunction has been described in ALS, clinicoradiological features associated with the olfactory dysfunction remain poorly understood. Methods: We enrolled 30 patients with ALS and age- and sex-matched 53 healthy controls (HCs). All participants underwent the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) and clinical assessments, including disease duration, ALSFRS-R, site of onset, forced vital capacity, and cognitive examinations that reflected the general, executive, memory and language function. We investigated the associations between OSIT-J score and clinical features and examined atrophic changes by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to MRI. Results: The OSIT-J score was significantly lower in ALS patients than HCs (6.9 +- 3.2 vs. 9.8 +- 1.9, p < 0.001). In ALS, there were significant relationships between OSIT-J score and age at examination, frontal assessment battery, word fluencies, digit span forward, and ADAS-Jcog recognition, but not education, disease type, duration, ALSFRS-R and, %VC. Multiple regression analysis with stepwise method showed the only ADAS-Jcog recognition substantially predicted OSIT-J score. VBM analysis with age, sex, total intracranial volume, and ADAS-Jcog recognition as covariates showed OSIT-J scores were substantially correlated with atrophic changes of left orbital cortex consisting of gyrus rectus and medial orbital gyrus and right hippocampus in ALS. Conclusion: ALS patients could show substantial olfactory dysfunction in association with orbital cortex and hippocampus involvements. The olfactory examination could be a useful marker for screening of frontotemporal alteration in ALS.

34383302|t|Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings Among Individuals With Olfactory and Cognitive Impairment.
34383302|a|OBJECTIVES: The underlying mechanism of the association between olfactory impairment and dementia may be explained by neurodegenerative changes detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The purpose of this systematic review is to describe neurodegenerative changes on MRI in patients with olfactory impairment and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A literature search encompassing PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies with MRI and olfactory testing among participants diagnosed with MCI or dementia was performed. Sample size, study design, cognitive impairment type, olfactory testing, and MRI findings were abstracted. Two investigators independently reviewed all articles. RESULTS: The search yielded 556 nonduplicate abstracts, from which 86 articles were reviewed and 24 were included. Seventeen (71%) of 24 studies reported hippocampal volume findings, with 14 studies reporting a relationship between hippocampal volume and olfactory performance. Two (50%) of four prospective studies reported the potential utility of baseline hippocampal volume as a marker of dementia conversion from MCI. Five (21%) of 24 studies reporting olfactory functional MRI (fMRI) findings highlighted the utility of olfactory fMRI to identify individuals in the early stages of cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests hippocampal volume correlates with olfactory performance in individuals with cognitive impairment, and that olfactory fMRI may improve early detection of AD. However, the predictive utility of these imaging markers is limited in prospective studies. MRI may be a useful modality for selecting patients at high risk of future cognitive decline for enrollment in early treatment trials. Laryngoscope, 132:177-187, 2022.

34536552|t|Heterozygous GBA D409V and ATP13a2 mutations do not exacerbate pathological alpha-synuclein spread in the prodromal preformed fibrils model in young mice.
34536552|a|Autophagic dysregulation and lysosomal impairment have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, partly due to the identification of mutations in multiple genes involved in these pathways such as GBA, SNCA, ATP13a2 (also known as PARK9), TMEM175 and LRRK2. Mutations resulting in lysosomal dysfunction are proposed to contribute to Parkinson's disease by increasing alpha-synuclein levels, that in turn may promote aggregation of this protein. Here, we used two different genetic models-one heterozygous for a mutated form of the GBA protein (D409V), and the other heterozygous for an ATP13a2 loss-of-function mutation, to test whether these mutations exacerbate the spread of alpha-synuclein pathology following injection of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils in the olfactory bulb of 12-week-old mice. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that mice harboring GBA D409V+/- and ATP13a2+/- mutations did not have exacerbated behavioral impairments or histopathology (alpha-synuclein, LAMP2, and Iba1) when compared to their wildtype littermates. This indicates that in the young mouse brain, neither the GBA D409V mutation or ATP13a2 loss-of-function mutation accelerate the spread of alpha-synuclein pathology. As a consequence, we postulate that these mutations increase Parkinson's disease risk only by acting in one of the initial, upstream events in the Parkinson's disease pathogenic process. Further, the mutations, and the molecular pathways they impact, appear to play a less important role once the pathogenic process has been triggered and therefore do not specifically influence alpha-synuclein pathology spread.

34963564|t|Immunomodifying and neuroprotective effects of noscapine: Implications for multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders.
34963564|a|Noscapine is a phthalide isoquinoline alkaloid with antitussive activity. Noscapine protects oligodendroglia from ischemic and chemical injury, binds to bitter taste receptors, antagonizes the bradykinin and histaminergic systems, which may be of benefit in treatment of multiple sclerosis. Noscapine normalizes axonal transport and exerts significant therapeutic efficacy in animal models of Parkinson's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Noscapine exerts neuroprotective effects on oxygen- and glucose-deprived fetal cortical neuronal cells and reduces ischemic brain damage in neonatal rat pups. Pilot clinical studies indicated some beneficial effects of noscapine in stroke. Noscapine harbours anxiolytic activity and methyl-noscapine blocks small conductance SK channels, which is beneficial in alleviating anxiety and depression. Noscapine exerts anticholinesterase activity and acts inhibitory on the inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB, which may be harnessed in treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. With its blood-brain barrier traversing features and versatile actions, noscapine may be a promising agent in the armamentarium against neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.

35266981|t|Assessment of Self-reported Sense of Smell, Objective Testing, and Associated Factors in Middle-aged and Older Women.
35266981|a|Importance: Poor olfaction is common in older adults and signifies multiple adverse health outcomes, but it often goes unrecognized. Objective: To characterize the self-awareness of poor olfaction in women, including its prevalence, associated factors, reporting reliability, validity against an objective test, and factors associated with validity. Design, Setting, and Participants: These cross-sectional survey data and a case-control subsample were taken from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Sister Study. Of 41 118 participants (aged 41-85 years) who reported olfaction in 2014 through 2016, 3406 (aged 50-79 years) reported olfaction again in 2018 through 2019 and completed the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test, version A, including 2353 women who self-reported poor olfaction in 2014 through 2016 and 1053 women who reported normal olfaction. Data analyses were performed between May 28, 2021, and December 23, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported (yes/no) and objectively tested poor olfaction defined as a Brief Smell Identification Test score of 9 or lower. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess factors that might be associated with the prevalence and reporting accuracy of self-reported olfaction. In subsample analyses, the sampling strategy was accounted for to extrapolate data to eligible cohort samples. Results: Of the 41 118 women (mean [SD] age, 64.3 [8.7] years) included in the analysis, 3322 (8.1%) self-reported poor olfaction. Higher prevalence was associated with older age, not being married, current smoking status, frequent coffee drinking, overweight or obesity, less than optimal health, Parkinson disease, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and seasonal allergy, whereas a lower prevalence was associated with non-Hispanic Black race and physical activity. In the subsample analyses, olfaction status reported 3 years apart showed a modest agreement (kappa, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.51-0.61). The prevalence of objectively tested poor olfaction was 13.3% (95% CI, 11.5%-15.0%), and in contrast with self-reports, it was twice as high in non-Hispanic Black women as in non-Hispanic White women (24.5% vs 12.5%). Compared with objective tests, self-reports showed a low sensitivity (22.6%; 95% CI, 19.6%-25.6%), especially in non-Hispanic Black women (12.4%; 95% CI, 7.0%-17.8%). The specificity was uniformly high (>90%). Among participants who reported poor olfaction, higher odds of true vs false positives were associated with age older than 60 years (60-64 years old, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.51-1.87; 65-69 years old, 2.26; 95% CI, 2.03-2.51; 70-74 years old, 3.34; 95% CI, 3.00-3.73; >=75 years old, 5.17; 95% CI, 4.43-6.03), non-Hispanic Black race (2.00; 95% CI, 1.70-2.36), no college education (1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.48), underweight (1.40; 95% CI, 1.04-1.88), fair or poor health (1.37; 95% CI, 1.22-1.54), and Parkinson disease (7.60; 95% CI, 5.60-10.32). Among those with objectively tested poor olfaction, lower odds of true positives vs false negatives were associated with Black race (0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.86). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, the self-awareness and reporting accuracy of poor olfaction in middle-aged and older women were low, particularly in non-Hispanic Black women. Given its potential health implications, awareness of this common sensory deficit should be raised.

36038126|t|Evaluation of the sense of taste and smell in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
36038126|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) have an impaired sense of smell or taste. Neurofibromin, the NF1gene protein product is ubiquitous in the body and is especially associated with the development of neurogenetic structures. Lately enlarged olfactory bulbs have been described in patients with NF1. Until now, there is no study to evaluate the sense of smell and taste in patients with NF1. METHOD: This study has been approved by the Hamburg Ethics committee. An evaluation of the sense of smell and taste was undertaken in 26 patients with NF1 using the Burghart Sniffin' Sticks. Three patients were excluded due to a prior infection with the Corona virus. As a control group the same examination was performed in healthy individuals (same sex/ same age as the NF1 patients) by the same examiner. RESULTS: The results show a normal sense of smell in patients with NF1. The morphologic finding of enlarged olfactory bulbs seem to have no functional equivalent. However, 8 out of 23 patients with NF1 had difficulties identifying at least one taste flavor. In total 9.8% of possible taste qualities were misidentified. In the healthy control group, all taste qualities were identified correctly. Considering each taste quality as separate case, a significant difference in the taste function was identified based on Fisher's exact test (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: The current study does not show a correlation between NF1 and an impaired sense of smell. Yet significant reduction in the sense of taste was found in the patients with NF1. Further research will have to be conducted to find the underlying causal pathways. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: NF1 is recently being acknowledged not only for its' macroscopic aesthetic and functional impairments, but also as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Evaluating the neural structures in regard to their function is a first step in understanding more about the disease.

37146370|t|The effects of cognition, quality of life, and fatigue on olfactory function in patients with multiple sclerosis.
37146370|a|AIM: The frequency of olfactory dysfunction in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has revealed very different results in studies. Some studies have shown that olfactory dysfunction may be associated with cognitive impairment and poor quality of life. In these studies, different odor tests and cognitive tests were used and different results were obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty literate patients over the age of 18 and 24 healthy volunteers of similar age and education were included in the study. Sniffin' Sticks Odor Test, California Verbal Learning Test II, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Trail-Making Test, Quality of Life Short Form-36, Fatigue Impact Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were applied to the individuals. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction was detected in 50 % of the patients. High disability rate, low cognitive functions, low quality of life, and fatigue were identified as the factors affecting olfactory function negatively. Odor discrimination and identification abilities were associated with disability level and cognitive functions, whereas quality of life was linked to odor threshold scores. The olfactory function and cognitive abilities of patients with progressive MS (n = 5) were worse than those of patients with relapsing remitting MS (n = 35). CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction is common in patients with MS and is associated with disability and quality of life. Olfactory function can be used in the follow-up of patients and olfactory dysfunction deserves further study as a metric that might emerge as a biomarker.

38978196|t|Smell loss is associated with cognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.
38978196|a|BACKGROUND: Smell loss significantly impacts the quality of life in patients. However, there is limited research on smell loss in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the correlation between smell loss and cognitive impairment is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between smell loss and cognition impairment in ALS patients. METHODS: The study included 216 ALS patients. The Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS) and smell identification test specifically for the Chinese population (CSIT) were administered to evaluate participants' cognitive and olfactory function, respectively. RESULTS: After covarying for age, sex, BMI, education level, degree of hunger, dietary bias, eagerness for food, stress, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or rhinitis, CSIT scores were significantly correlated with ECAS scores (r = 0.162, p = 0.028), especially the ALS-specific scores (r = 0.158, p = 0.031). Even after excluding patients with URTI or rhinitis, the results were similar. CSIT scores were significantly correlated with ECAS scores (r = 0.224, p = 0.011), especially the ALS-specific scores (r = 0.205, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: In patients with ALS, smell loss is significantly correlated with cognitive impairment, particularly frontotemporal dysfunction. Cognitive dysfunction may lead to worse olfactory performance in ALS patients.

174916|t|Olfaction in multiple sclerosis. With a note on the discrepancy between optic and olfactory involvement.
174916|a|Serial binary dilutions of amyl acetate and nitrobenzene were used in a double-blind test to determine olfactory acuity of 40 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Similar determinations were made on 24 age- and sex-matched controls. Results of repeated measurements on 18 patients indicated that the methodology was reliably reproducible. When mean olfactory threshold on MS patients was compared with that of the controls no differences could be found. Among the MS patients, olfactory threshold did not vary with the presence or absence of optic involvement and correlated poorly with the degree of disability. These results are in disagreement with those of WENDER and SZMEJA who reported olfactory dysfunction in 18 out of 52 MS patients. Our findings are compatible with the observations of ZIMMERMAN and NETSKY who failed to find any plaques in olfactory tracts of MS brains. The significance of this disparity between involvement of optic and olfactory systems, both of which contain central myelin, is discussed. Available biochemical evidence suggests that, as postulated by LUMSDEN, sparing of olfactory tracts may in part be related to the relatively lower basic protein content of these structures.

3753915|t|Rank order scaling in taste evaluation.
3753915|a|A scoring system developed for comparing taste in two groups of individuals, patients with multiple sclerosis and a normal control group is described. The scoring system was extended to evaluate taste in renal patients paired by age and sex with controls. The results of the two comparisons are given. The scoring system can be used very flexibly in statistical comparison among groups and generated easily using a FORTRAN computer program. The use of this scoring system is compared with an alternative method which uses psychophysical functions.

6690766|t|Olfactory meningiomas. The missed diagnosis.
6690766|a|Olfactory meningiomas are benign, slow-growing intracranial tumors arising from the dura along the cribriform plate. The first clinical symptom is anosmia followed, usually after several years, by dementia and visual deterioration. A series of 36 patients are presented; in all cases but one, their conditions were diagnosed late and not until the tumor had reached a very large size. By the time the proper diagnosis was made and the tumors were surgically removed, mental or visual disability was often irreversible. Conditions of patients initially seen with anosmia should be investigated by presently available noninvasive diagnostic methods including computed tomographic scanning.

7176291|t|Presence of fungiform papillae in classic dysautonomia.
7176291|a|Lack of fungiform papillae over the surface of the tongue is considered essential for the diagnosis of familial dysautonomia. We describe two cases with dysautonomia in which the diagnosis was delayed because numerous fungiform papillae were easily seen. Only a close inspection of the tongue with an ophthalmologic slit lamp revealed that each papilla was degenerated and atrophic. Lacking a clinical sine qua non or easily available diagnostic laboratory tests, fungiform papillae should be studied in detail to establish not only that their number is sufficient but also that their shape and structure are normal. The simple technique described enables confirmation of the diagnosis in children and newborns in whom familial dysautonomia is suspected.

7493410|t|Expression of the amyloid protein precursor of Alzheimer's disease in the developing rat olfactory system.
7493410|a|The expression of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was examined in the olfactory system of the developing rat. Two monoclonal antibodies were used to detect APP: Alz-90, which specifically recognizes APP, and 22C11 which recognizes both APP and the structurally related protein APLP-2. Very similar patterns of immunoreactivity were observed with both antibodies. APP immunoreactivity was first detected in a subpopulation of olfactory epithelial cells at embryonic day 16 (E16), at a time when primary sensory olfactory axons are first beginning to pierce the glia limitans of the olfactory bulb. At E16, there were more olfactory receptor neurons which expressed APP than the olfactory marker protein (OMP), indicating that some APP-containing neurons were not fully mature. Between E16 and postnatal day 8 (P8), there was a marked increase in the number of primary sensory olfactory neurons expressing APP. In the olfactory bulb, APP was first detected in the mitral cell layer at E18, at a time when synapses are first beginning to form between the dendrites of these cells and primary sensory axons. The level of APP detected within mitral cell perikarya decreased after birth and could no longer be detected between P3 and P8. This indicated that once synaptic connections had been initiated within olfactory glomeruli, the expression of APP within the mitral cells was down-regulated. High levels of APP were, however, detected within the olfactory nerve fiber layer and glomeruli between P3 and P8. The results demonstrate that APP expression in the olfactory system is coordinately regulated with the major periods of synaptogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

7625148|t|Olfactory function in atypical parkinsonian syndromes.
7625148|a|INTRODUCTION: Olfaction is markedly impaired in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). This deficit contrasts with reports of preserved or only mildly reduced olfaction in patients with atypical parkinsonism. However, the sensitivity and specificity of olfactory function testing in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes has not been studied. In addition, olfactory function in patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) with a test score ranging from 0 to 40 we studied olfactory function in patients with IPD as well as other parkinsonian syndromes including CBD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). RESULTS: UPSIT scores in 118 patients with IPD, 29 with MSA, 15 with PSP, and 7 patients with CBD, as well as in 123 healthy control subjects revealed a marked impairment in the IPD group in contrast to mild impairment in MSA patients and normal olfaction in PSP and CBD patients. An UPSIT score of 25/40 was associated with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 85% in differentiating IPD from atypical parkinsonism. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that olfactory function is differentially impaired or preserved in distinct parkinsonian syndromes and that it might also have some value as a diagnostic pointer. Thus, preserved or mildly impaired olfactory function in a parkinsonian patient is more likely to be related to atypical parkinsonism such as MSA, PSP or CBD, whereas markedly reduced olfaction is more suggestive of IPD.

8156717|t|[A 46-year-old woman with myasthenia gravis associated with macromastia, erythroderma and hypogeusia].
8156717|a|A 46-year-old woman developed blepharoptosis, diplopia and hypogeusia in 1984, and was diagnosed as having myasthenia gravis and malignant thymoma. Her symptoms improved by thymectomy and oral prednisolone administration. In 1988 she complained of breast pain and swelling during menstruation. In 1990 her breast was enlarged to the size of an adult head, and she developed erythroderma and hypogeusia. She was admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital in August, 1990. On admission, erythema was seen in the whole body especially in the face, anterior chest, abdomen and the thigh. Her breast was the size of an adult head. Muscle strength was weak, and ocular movement was limited. She had blepharoptosis. Papillae of the tongue were atrophic. Endoclinological investigations revealed an elevation of PRL to 14.6 ng/ml (normal < 10), antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor to 118.0 nM (normal < 0.5). In TRH stimulation test the response of PRL was amplified. Four intrathoracic masses suspected of recurrence of malignant thymoma were seen in CT. Her macromastia depended upon the amount of PRL, and was reduced by bromocriptine. Erythroderma and hypogeusia were relieved by plasmaphersis. Therefore autoimmune mechanism may be related to these symptoms.

9285449|t|Assessment of olfaction in multiple sclerosis: evidence of dysfunction by olfactory evoked response and identification tests.
9285449|a|OBJECTIVE: To resolve whether the olfactory pathways are affected in multiple sclerosis. METHODS: Olfaction was assessed by: (1) The University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT, which uses microencapsulated odours that are released when scratched with a pencil) in 72 patients with multiple sclerosis and 96 controls, (2) olfactory evoked potentials (OEP) to 20 ppm H2S by volume, and 50% CO2 in air for 45 patients with multiple sclerosis and 47 controls. The abnormality rate in patients with multiple sclerosis for both tests (1) and (2) was compared with that for visual evoked potentials measured using a standard checquerboard technique. RESULTS: By comparison with controls, patients exhibited significantly low scores on the smell identification test with 15% of patients scoring outside the 95% confidence intervals for controls. The UPSIT was occasionally abnormal when the visual evoked potential (VEP) was normal. In general UPSIT scores correlated well with the H2S-evoked response in controls and patients. For H2S, there was a statistically significant increase of latency and decrease of amplitude for patients compared with controls. Increased H2S latency and reduced UPSIT score correlated with greater disability on conventional rating scales. Overall, H2S responses were abnormal in about one quarter of patients with multiple sclerosis. The sensitivity of UPSIT and OEP was similar although disorder on one test did not necessarily indicate abnormality in the other. The visual evoked potential was found to be a more sensitive indicator of disease than OEP or UPSIT. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the existence of olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis and validate a new evoked potential technique.

9929684|t|Olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis. Relation to plaque load in inferior frontal and temporal lobes.
9929684|a|The question of whether and to what degree multiple sclerosis (MS) influences the ability to smell is controversial. We administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) to 26 MS patients and concurrently employed high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify the number of demyelinating plaques within central brain structures. 38.5% of the patients demonstrated olfactory loss, with 7.7% exhibiting severe microsmia, 19.2% moderate microsmia, and 11.5% mild microsmia. None was anosmic, and no consistent left:right asymmetry in olfactory function or in hemispheric plaque numbers was observed. A strong negative correlation was found (Spearman r = -0.94) between UPSIT scores and the number of plaques within the inferior frontal and temporal lobes, but not within the rest of the brain. This study unequivocally demonstrates that a sizable proportion of MS patients suffer from olfactory loss commensurate with plaque activity within olfactory-related central brain regions, and is the first to explicate a physical basis for the olfactory dysfunction of any common neurologic disease.

10933437|t|Assessing olfaction in the Italian population: methodology and clinical application.
10933437|a|Disorders of the sense of smell are receiving growing clinical as well as experimental attention. Indeed, several neurological conditions have been associated with peripheral or central deficits of the olfactory system. In recent years, particular emphasis has been attributed to the early and severe olfactory impairment in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease. Olfactory assessment has also been included in comprehensive pre- and post-surgical evaluations of temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, the request for standardized methods of olfactory evaluation by forensic and occupational medicine is greatly increasing. Despite this requirement, there is no agreement in the Italian neurological community on olfactory assessment. This lack prompted us to generate a battery of standardized tests capable of bypassing cross-cultural differences in olfactory assessment and to be potentially useful in the clinical as well as experimental settings. Procedures of assessment of olfactory acuity (detection threshold), identification (multiple choice odor naming), discrimination (differentiation between similar/dissimilar odorants) and memory (recognition of a substance previously smelled) are fully described. In order to control bias factors depending upon the nature of the investigated disorder and the applied olfactory tasks, a minimal complementary neuropsychological assessment is recommended.

11464953|t|A phase I/II trial of recombinant methionyl human brain derived neurotrophic factor administered by intrathecal infusion to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
11464953|a|BACKGROUND: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent survival factor for motoneurons. This study investigated the safety and tolerability of recombinant methionyl human BDNF (r-metHuBDNF) infused intrathecally by means of an implanted pump in patients with ALS. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with probable or definite ALS were treated with either r-metHuBDNF (25, 60, 150, 400 or 1000 microg/day) or placebo in a 12-week, randomized, double-blinded, sequential, dose-escalation study. Test treatment was interrupted by a washout period from days 11 to 25 to allow the evaluation of laboratory safety measures. In each dose cohort four patients received r-metHuBDNF and one received placebo. On completion of the double-blind period of the study all patients continued to receive r-metHuBDNF in an open-label extension for up to 60 weeks. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken periodically from all patients for the measurement of r-metHuBDNF levels and in a minority of patients these were supplemented by cistemal samples. RESULTS: Within days after the initiation of infusion the majority of patients receiving r-metHuBDNF reported mild sensory symptoms, including paraesthesias or a sense of warmth, which were usually confined to the lower limbs and were frequently exacerbated by neck flexion. In most instances these symptoms decreased or even disappeared over several weeks. Sleep disturbance, dry mouth, agitation and other behavioural effects were encountered at higher doses (>150 microg/day) and necessitated dose reductions. The spinal CSF levels of r-metHuBDNF were directly related to dose, with a lumbar to cervical ratio of approximately 4:1. CONCLUSIONS: The intrathecal delivery of r-metHuBDNF in doses of up to 150 microg/day was well tolerated and appears feasible. The reversible CNS effects with higher dose indicate that BDNF can be delivered cranially against CSF flow. The small number of patients and the design of the study did not permit conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of the treatment.

14570842|t|Olfactory dysfunction in degenerative ataxias.
14570842|a|Several lines of evidence suggest that the cerebellum may play a role in higher-order olfactory processing. In this study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a standardised test of olfactory function, to patients with ataxias primarily due to cerebellar pathology (spinocerebellar ataxias and related disorders) and to patients with Friedreich ataxia, an ataxia associated mainly with loss of afferent cerebellar pathways. UPSIT scores were slightly lower in both patient groups than in the control subjects, but no differences were noted between the scores of the Friedreich and the other ataxia patients. Within the Friedreich ataxia group, the smell test scores did not correlate with the number of pathologic GAA repeats (a marker of genetic severity), disease duration, or categorical ambulatory ability. UPSIT scores did not correlate with disease duration, although they correlated marginally with ambulatory status in the patients with cerebellar pathology. This study suggests that olfactory dysfunction may be a subtle clinical component of degenerative ataxias, in concordance with the hypothesis that the cerebellum or its afferents plays some role in central olfactory processing.

14673578|t|Olfactory dysfunction in cerebellar ataxia and multiple system atrophy.
14673578|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction has been reported in Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: We studied olfactory function in eight patients with multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), eleven patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia of unknown etiology and thirteen controls matched for age and gender. Subjects received tests for n-butanol odor thresholds, odor identification, and odor discrimination. RESULTS: Olfactory thresholds were abnormally high in 16% of the patients. Odor discrimination and odor identification were impaired in 44 % and 74% of the patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in olfactory function between patients with sporadic ataxia of unknown etiology and MSA-C patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that olfactory dysfunction is common to various neurodegenerative disorders and not specifically restricted to PD or AD. Cerebellar dysfunction affected suprathreshold olfactory function more severely than odor thresholds. Thus cerebellar lesions may affect the processing of odor-related information to a higher degree than the transport of odorants to the receptor through sniffing.

15911797|t|[99mTc]TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging correlates with odor identification in early Parkinson disease.
15911797|a|BACKGROUND: In vivo imaging of the dopamine transporter with [99mTc]TRODAT-1 (TRODAT) and olfactory testing have both been proposed as potential biomarkers in Parkinson disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between TRODAT SPECT imaging, odor identification skills, and motor function in patients with early PD. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with a clinical diagnosis of early-stage PD (mean Hoehn & Yahr stage = 1.4) underwent TRODAT imaging, Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) ratings of motor function, and administration of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Brain images were obtained using a standardized processing protocol and specific uptake ratios for striatal regions of interest were calculated. Partial correlations between the imaging indices, disease duration, UPSIT scores, and UPDRS motor scores were then calculated. RESULTS: UPSIT scores were correlated with TRODAT uptake in the striatum as a whole (r = 0.66, p = 0.001). The putamen showed the strongest correlation with the UPSIT (r = 0.74; p < 0.001). The correlation between dopamine transporter density in the caudate and UPSIT was moderate (r = 0.36, p = 0.11), but was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory function is highly correlated with dopamine transporter imaging abnormalities in early Parkinson disease (PD). Further studies are warranted to determine whether changes over time in these two measures are also correlated in early PD.

16467634|t|An updated review of clinical olfaction.
16467634|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Disorders of the sense of smell can result through hundreds of different processes, but most commonly occur from upper-respiratory-tract infections, trauma, and chronic rhinosinusitis. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Research in the basic science of olfaction has progressed rapidly with powerful new molecular discoveries; however, our ability to treat these disorders remains limited. In clinical olfaction we are just realizing the broader existence of the sensory dysfunction in our population. We are discovering associations between neurodegenerative disorders and smell function that may allow us to identify these disorders earlier in the disease process. We are also challenging our previous categorization schemes and realizing that many etiologies cross the traditional conductive and neuro-sensory divisions. SUMMARY: Currently, aside from the possible therapeutic potential of systemic steroids, we have no effective treatment for the most common causes of olfactory loss. Recent advances in the basic science of olfaction provides us with an opportunity to develop new and novel clinical studies in an attempt at improving the quality of life for many of these patients.

16763975|t|Extrapyramidal symptoms in Wilson's disease are associated with olfactory dysfunction.
16763975|a|Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper, mainly in the liver and the brain. As copper accumulation in the brain leads to disturbances in basal ganglia function, neurological-type patients typically present with hypo- and hyperkinetic extrapyramidal symptoms, with Parkinsonism being very common. Although there are numerous reports on olfactory deficits in primary neurodegenerative disorders, olfactory function has not been investigated in metabolic disorders presenting with extrapyramidal features. Twenty-four patients with Wilson's disease participated in the investigation. All patients were treated pharmacologically. They comprised patients with liver disease alone (including mild enzyme elevation in asymptomatic individuals; n = 11) and/or neurological symptoms (n = 13) at the time of testing. Twenty-one patients underwent both [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was judged using a clinical score system ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). In all patients, psychophysical testing was performed using the Sniffin' Sticks, which involved tests for odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Results from the present study revealed that Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms show a significant olfactory dysfunction compared to hepatic-type patients. Individuals who are more severely neurologically affected also present with a more pronounced olfactory deficit. Of interest, there was no significant effect of long-term treatment with penicillamine on olfactory function. Olfactory function did not correlate significantly with the presence of MRI visible lesions in the basal ganglia or with any regional glucose metabolism as measured by [18]F-FDG-PET. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the underlying pathological alterations with degeneration in the basal ganglia and neuronal loss in association with a marked increase of the copper content in this brain region play a role in the olfactory deficit.

17380245|t|Odour identification in frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
17380245|a|Little information is available concerning olfactory processing in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). We undertook a case-control study of olfactory processing in three male patients fulfilling clinical criteria for FTLD. Odour identification (semantic analysis) and odour discrimination (perceptual analysis) were investigated using tests adapted from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. General neuropsychometry and structural volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were also performed. The three patients with FTLD exhibited a disorder of olfactory processing with the characteristics of a predominantly semantic (odour identification) deficit. This olfactory deficit was more prominent in patients with greater involvement of the temporal lobes on MRI. Central deficits of odour identification may be more common in FTLD than previously recognised, and these deficits may assist in clinical characterisation.

17400200|t|Olfactory abnormalities in Huntington's disease: decreased plasticity in the primary olfactory cortex of R6/1 transgenic mice and reduced olfactory discrimination in patients.
17400200|a|Reduced neuronal plasticity in the striatum, hippocampus, and neocortex is a common feature of transgenic mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD). Doublecortin (DCX) and polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) are associated with structural plasticity in the adult mammalian brain, are markers of newly formed neurons in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus, and are highly expressed in primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Animal studies have demonstrated that a reduction in plasticity in the piriform cortex is associated with a selective impairment in odour discrimination. Therefore, the number of DCX and PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells in the piriform cortex were quantified as measures of plasticity in early stage (fifteen week old) R6/1 transgenic HD mice. The transgenic mice had a large reduction in the number of DCX and PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells in the piriform cortex, similar to that previously reported in the R6/2 mice. We also tested whether odour discrimination, as well as identification and detection, were impaired in HD patients and found that patients (at a similar disease stage as the mice) had an impairment in odour discrimination and identification, but not odour detection. These results suggest that olfactory impairments observed in HD patients may be the result of reduced plasticity in the primary olfactory cortex.

17497563|t|Impairments in source memory for olfactory and visual stimuli in preclinical and clinical stages of Huntington's disease.
17497563|a|Individuals in preclinical and clinical stages of Huntington's disease (HD) demonstrate impairments in olfactory functioning. In addition, HD patients are impaired in source memory for verbal stimuli. A task combining both source and odor memory may be particularly sensitive to early changes in HD. The present study examined source and item memory for olfactory and visual stimuli in 10 individuals with HD, 10 asymptomatic HD gene carriers, 8 nongene carriers who had a parent with HD, and 20 normal controls. During the study phase, a male and a female experimenter (sources) presented odors and objects to the participant in an alternating sequence. To assess item memory, a stimulus from the study phase (target) and a novel stimulus (distractor) were presented, and the participant was asked to choose the target. To assess source memory, the experimenter presented a stimulus and asked whether the male or female experimenter had previously presented the stimulus. Results indicate that source memory for both visual and olfactory stimuli was impaired in HD patients compared to normal controls. In asymptomatic gene carriers, however, source memory for olfactory stimuli, but not visual stimuli, was more impaired than in nongene carriers and normal controls. Furthermore, gene carriers and HD patients showed a similar degree of impairment in source memory for olfactory stimuli. The only significant impairment found in item memory was for olfactory stimuli in HD patients. These results suggest that source memory for olfactory stimuli may be particularly sensitive to neuropathological changes in preclinical stages of HD.

18096682|t|Detection of Huntington's disease decades before diagnosis: the Predict-HD study.
18096682|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of the Predict-HD study is to use genetic, neurobiological and refined clinical markers to understand the early progression of Huntington's disease (HD), prior to the point of traditional diagnosis, in persons with a known gene mutation. Here we estimate the approximate onset and initial course of various measurable aspects of HD relative to the time of eventual diagnosis. METHODS: We studied 438 participants who were positive for the HD gene mutation, but did not yet meet the diagnostic criteria for HD and had no functional decline. Predictability of baseline cognitive, motor, psychiatric and imaging measures was modelled non-linearly using estimated time until diagnosis (based on CAG repeat length and current age) as the predictor. RESULTS: Estimated time to diagnosis was related to most clinical and neuroimaging markers. The patterns of association suggested the commencement of detectable changes one to two decades prior to the predicted time of clinical diagnosis. The patterns were highly robust and consistent, despite the varied types of markers and diverse measurement methodologies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings from the Predict-HD study suggest the approximate time scale of measurable disease development, and suggest candidate disease markers for use in preventive HD trials.

18702696|a|Accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system is a hallmark of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) and mutations that increase alpha-synuclein levels cause familial PD. Transgenic mice overexpressing alpha-synuclein under the Thy1 promoter (Thy1-aSyn) have high levels of alpha-synuclein expression throughout the brain but no loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons up to 8 months, suggesting that they may be useful to model pre-clinical stages of PD. Olfactory dysfunction often precedes the onset of the cardinal motor symptoms of PD by several years and includes deficits in odor detection, discrimination and identification. In the present study, we measured olfactory function in 3- and 9-month-old male Thy1-aSyn mice with a buried pellet test based on latency to find an exposed or hidden odorant, a block test based on exposure to self and non-self odors, and a habituation/dishabituation test based on exposure to non-social odors. In a separate group of mice, alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was assessed in the olfactory bulb. Compared with wildtype littermates, Thy1-aSyn mice could still detect and habituate to odors but showed olfactory impairments in aspects of all three testing paradigms. Thy1-aSyn mice also displayed proteinase K-resistant alpha-synuclein inclusions throughout the olfactory bulb. These data indicate that overexpression of alpha-synuclein is sufficient to cause olfactory deficits in mice similar to that observed in patients with PD. Furthermore, the buried pellet and block tests provided sufficient power for the detection of a 50% drug effect, indicating their usefulness for testing novel neuroprotective therapies.

18852351|t|The spectrum of parkinsonian manifestations associated with glucocerebrosidase mutations.
18852351|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) result in Gaucher disease and can be associated with a phenotype characterized by adult-onset progressive neurologic deterioration and parkinsonism. OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical and neurologic spectrum of parkinsonian manifestations associated with GBA mutations. Design, Setting, and Patients A prospective case series of 10 patients (7 men and 3 women) with parkinsonism and GBA mutations evaluated at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The GBA genotypes were identified by means of DNA sequencing. Tests evaluating neurologic, motor, cognitive, ocular, and olfactory functions were performed and the results were analyzed by a single team. RESULTS: Genotyping identified GBA mutations N370S, L444P, and c.84dupG and recombinant alleles. The mean age at onset of parkinsonian manifestations was 49 years (range, 39-65 years), disease duration was 7.8 years (range, 1.2-16.0 years), and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part III score was 26.3 (range, 13-38). Half of the patients reported cognitive changes later in the disease course. Six patients were diagnosed as having Parkinson disease, 3 as having Lewy body dementia, and 1 as having a "Parkinson plus" syndrome. The most frequent nonmotor finding was olfactory dysfunction. Atypical manifestations included myoclonus, electroencephalographic abnormalities, and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: In the homozygous and heterozygous states, GBA mutations are associated with a spectrum of parkinsonian phenotypes ranging from Parkinson disease, mostly of the akinetic type, to a less common phenotype characteristic of Lewy body dementia.

19176961|t|Treatment of early Parkinson's disease. Part 2.
19176961|a|The management of early Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the treatment of motor symptoms, and, increasingly, non-motor symptoms. Given the fast pace of clinical research in PD, clinicians are faced with the challenge of integrating the latest findings into the ongoing care of individual PD patients. Part 1 of this 2-part article reviews efficacy and safety data for the newest PD treatment options, as well as for established therapies. Part 2 of the article, presented here, reviews key data relevant to the assessment of potential neuroprotective therapies and the treatment of non-motor symptoms.

19445966|t|Rule learning, visuospatial function and motor performance in the Hdh(Q92) knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease.
19445966|a|Among a range of genetic mouse models of Huntington's disease, knock-in models that express full-length mutant huntingtin tend to have a slower developing and less severe behavioural phenotype than transgenic models carrying truncated variations of the human gene; as a result, these more subtle full-length knock-in models have been relatively neglected for behavioural and therapeutic studies. In the current study, we show that full-length knock-in Hdh(Q92) mice exhibit marked impairments at a relatively young age in delayed alternation, a cognitive test conducted in 9-hole operant chambers classically associated with prefrontal and corticostriatal function. Additional tests of motivation, visuomotor and rotarod performance were undertaken to determine the frontal-like specificity of the impairment; aspects of sensorimotor and motivational as well as cognitive performance were deficient in Hdh(Q92/Q92) mice in comparison with their wildtype littermates by 27 months of age. The present results demonstrate that Hdh(Q92/Q92) mice do exhibit clear impairments on a range of sensory, motor, motivational and cognitive tests, provided appropriate sensitive tasks are used.

20433414|t|No benefits from experimental treatment with olfactory ensheathing cells in patients with ALS.
20433414|a|Cell based therapies may be promising options for treating ALS. These therapies aim at neuronal replacement or they may prevent dysfunctional motor neurons from dying. Conflicting results on transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) in ALS mouse models indicate that this technique is not yet ready to progress to clinical trials. A Chinese group has nevertheless treated ALS patients with OECs. We carried out a prospective study of seven patients who underwent OEC treatment in China, following them from four months before departure until one year after treatment. Muscle strength, level of daily functioning and respiratory capacity were measured at regular intervals. Three patients reported subjective positive effects directly after treatment. No individual objective improvement was measured, and outcome measures gradually declined in all patients. Two patients had severe side-effects. Based on our findings in these ALS patients who underwent experimental OEC treatment, we conclude that there are no indications that this treatment is beneficial.

20629126|t|Gaucher disease ascertained through a Parkinson's center: imaging and clinical characterization.
20629126|a|Among the genes implicated for parkinsonism is glucocerebrosidase (GBA), which causes Gaucher disease (GD). Despite a growing literature that GD may present as parkinsonism, neuroimaging, olfaction, and neuropsychological testing have not been extensively reported. We describe transcranial sonography (TCS), 18F-fluorodopa (F-dopa) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron emission tomography, olfaction testing, neuropsychological testing, and clinical features in homozygous and compound heterozygous GBA mutation carriers identified through screening of 250 Ashkenazi Jewish parkinsonian individuals treated at a tertiary care center. We identified two individuals with N370S/R496H compound heterozygous mutations and two with N370S homozygous mutations; one individual died before completing detailed evaluation. TCS (n = 3) demonstrated nigral hyperechogenicity that was greater than controls [median area maximal substantia nigra echogenicity (aSNmax) = 0.28 cm(2) vs. 0.14 cm(2), P = 0.005], but similar to idiopathic PD (aSNmax = 0.31 cm(2)). FDG PET (n = 2) demonstrated hypermetabolism of the lentiform nuclei, and F-fluorodopa PET (n = 2), bilateral reduction in striatal F-dopa uptake. Olfaction was markedly impaired in the two tested cases, including onset of smell disturbance in adolescence in one. Neuropsychological features (n = 3) were consistent with Parkinson's disease (PD) or diffuse Lewy body disease (DLB). The imaging, neuropsychological and olfactory markers suggest the GD phenotype includes PD with and without features of DLB, marked olfactory loss, nigral hyperechogenicity on TCS, and F-dopa and FDG PET abnormalities.

20799106|t|The relationship between the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and olfaction in patients referred for a dementia evaluation.
20799106|a|The current study examined the relationship between a standardized dementia battery (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status [RBANS]) and a test of olfactory discrimination (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT]) in a heterogeneous sample of patients referred for a dementia assessment (N = 103). Significant moderate correlations were found between the UPSIT and each of the RBANS indexes, with the strongest correlation for Total Scale score, followed by the Delayed Memory Index and the Language Index. Significant moderate correlations were also found between the UPSIT and 11 of the 12 subtests of the RBANS. While the major RBANS indexes demonstrated significant correlations with education and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, a measure of premorbid IQ, the UPSIT did not. This suggests the UPSIT may be sensitive to decline in dementia and largely unaffected by premorbid cognitive functioning. As a result, the UPSIT may provide neuropsychologists with an efficient, cost-effective, and sensitive supplement to a standard dementia battery.

20975277|t|Olfactory identification deficits in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
20975277|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited angiopathy caused by mutations of the Notch 3 gene. Olfactory identification deficits are present in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. However, olfaction has not been investigated in CADASIL. The aim of the present study was to assess olfactory identification in CADASIL and to determine whether there is an association between olfactory identification and the frontotemporal lobe. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients and 27 control subjects had an olfactory identification test and neuropsychological testing. Brain MRIs were obtained from 25 patients. Involvement of frontal white matter, anterior temporal white matter and the external capsule were measured. RESULTS: Olfactory identification scores were lower in CADASIL patients than in healthy comparison subjects. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and semantic Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) were also affected. In CADASIL patients, olfactory identification scores correlated with MMSE, COWAT scores and Scheltens' scores from frontal white matter. The tendency for an association between olfactory identification scores and Scheltens' scores from anterior temporal white matter was also observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that olfactory identification deficits may be a sensitive indicator of frontotemporal dysfunction in CADASIL.

21047984|t|Altered activation patterns within the olfactory network in Parkinson's disease.
21047984|a|Olfactory impairment is a consistent premotor symptom in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), presumably caused by pathological processes in the olfactory bulb and olfactory structures within mesolimbic brain areas. The objective of the present study was to obtain an in-depth insight into olfactory network dysfunction in PD patients. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (3 T) was conducted with 16 early-stage PD patients and 16 matched controls during an odor detection task. Activation within the olfactory network was analyzed both in terms of strength of activation (whole-brain random effects, regions of interest [ROI] analysis based on the hemodynamic response function) as well as time-course characteristics (finite impulse response-based ROI analysis). Olfactory-induced activation in patients with PD in comparison to a standard activation pattern obtained from controls revealed profound hyperactivation in piriform and orbitofrontal cortices. However, whereas orbitofrontal areas seem to be unable to discriminate between signal and noise, primary olfactory cortex shows preserved discriminatory ability. These results support a complex network dysfunction that exceeds structural pathology observed in the olfactory bulb and mesolimbic cortices and thus demonstrate the important contribution of functional data to describe network dynamics occurring in the degenerating brain.

21221623|t|123I-MIBG cardiac uptake and smell identification in parkinsonian patients with LRRK2 mutations.
21221623|a|Reduced uptake of (123)I- metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) on cardiac gammagraphy and impaired odor identification are markers of neurodegenerative diseases with Lewy bodies (LB) as a pathological hallmark, such as idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). LRRK2 patients present with a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from IPD, but LB have not been found in some cases. Patients with such mutations could behave differently than patients with IPD with respect to MIBG cardiac uptake and olfaction. We studied 14 LRRK2 patients, 14 IPD patients matched by age, gender, disease duration and severity, and 13 age and gender matched control subjects. Olfaction was analyzed through the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). MIBG cardiac uptake was evaluated through the H/M ratio. The late H/M was 1.44 +- 0.31 for LRRK2 patients, 1.19 +- 0.15 for PD patients, and 1.67 +- 0.16 for control subjects. LRRK2 patients presented lower but not statistically significant MIBG cardiac uptake than controls (p = 0.08) and significant higher uptake than PD patients (p = 0.04). UPSIT mean scores were 21.5 +- 7.3 for LRRK2 patients, 18.7 +- 6.2 for IPD patients and 29.7 +- 5.7 for control subjects. UPSIT score was lower in both LRRK2 and PD than in controls. In LRRK2 patients a positive correlation was found between myocardial MIBG uptake and UPSIT scores, (R = 0.801, p < 0.001). In LRRK2 patients, MIBG cardiac uptake was less impaired than in PD; a positive correlation between MIBG cardiac uptake and UPSIT scores was observed. As MIBG cardiac reduced uptake and impaired odor identification are markers of LB pathology, this findings may represent neuropathological heterogeneity among LRRK2 patients.

21861097|t|Cognitive impairment in Huntington disease: diagnosis and treatment.
21861097|a|Cognition has been well characterized in the various stages of Huntington disease (HD) as well as in the prodrome before the motor diagnosis is given. Although the clinical diagnosis of HD relies on the manifestation of motor abnormalities, the associated impairments have been growing in prominence for several reasons. First, research to understand the most debilitating aspects of HD has suggested that cognitive and behavioral changes place the greatest burden on families, are most highly associated with functional decline, and can be predictive of institutionalization. Second, cognitive impairments are evident at least 15 years prior to the time at which motor diagnosis is given. Finally, cognitive decline is associated with biological markers such as brain atrophy, circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factors, and insulin-like growth factor 1. Efforts are now underway to develop valid and reliable measures of cognition in the prodrome as well as in all stages of HD so that clinical trials can be conducted using cognitive outcomes.

22125780|t|Just noticeable difference in olfaction: a discriminative tool between healthy elderly and patients with cognitive disorders associated with dementia.
22125780|a|Olfactory dysfunction appears to be one of the earliest signs of several age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer`s disease (AD) or Parkinson`s disease (PD). To rate performance and olfactory deficits in patients with cognitive disorders, various olfactory tasks have been used such as odor detection, discrimination, recognition memory, identification and naming but no study has been focused on just noticeable difference (JND), a sensitive tool of detection. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare variations in JNDs in healthy elderly and in patients with cognitive disorders associated with dementia. The results showed significantly higher olfactory JNDs in a population with cognitive disorders associated with dementia - i.e. a lower olfactory detection performance - compared to a control population paired in age, gender and education level. Additionally, the findings of the present study showed strong correlations between cognitive performances and JND scores in the control population contrary to the patient population. These findings are discussed in relation to the relevance of using olfactory JNDs in the diagnosis of dementias.

22834828|t|Adult neurogenesis in the olfactory system and neurodegenerative disease.
22834828|a|The olfactory system is unique in many respects-two of which include the process of adult neurogenesis which continually supplies it with newborn neurons, and the fact that neurodegenerative diseases are often accompanied by a loss of smell. A link between these two phenomena has been hypothesized, but recent evidence for the lack of robust adult neurogenesis in the human olfactory system calls into question this hypothesis. Nevertheless, model organisms continue to play a critical role in the exploration of neurodegenerative disease. In part one of this review we discuss the most promising recent technological advancements for studying adult neurogenesis in the murine olfactory system. Part two continues by looking at emerging evidence related to adult neurogenesis in neurodegenerative disease studied in model organisms and the differences between animal and human olfactory system adult neurogenesis. Hopefully, the careful application of advanced research methods to the study of neurodegenerative disease in model organisms, while taking into account the recently reported differences between the human and model organism olfactory system, will lead to a better understanding of the reasons for the susceptibility of olfaction to disease.

23494678|t|Levodopa gains psychostimulant-like properties after nigral dopaminergic loss.
23494678|a|Dopamine dysregulation syndrome shares some core behavioral features with psychostimulant addiction, suggesting that dopamine replacement therapy can acquire psychostimulantlike properties in some patients with Parkinson disease (PD). We here report strong experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis in an alpha-synuclein rat model of PD. Although levodopa had no effect in controls, it acquired 2 prominent psychostimulantlike properties in Parkinsonian rats: (1) it produced intense reward on its own and in parallel (2) decreased interest in other nondrug reward. These 2 effects may combine to explain the addictive use of levodopa after loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in some PD patients.

23817016|t|Dysregulation of brain olfactory and taste receptors in AD, PSP and CJD, and AD-related model.
23817016|a|Recently, we have shown the expression of novel chemoreceptors corresponding to the olfactory receptor (OR) and taste receptor (TASR) families in the human brain. We have also shown dysregulation of ORs and TASRs in the cerebral cortex in Parkinson's disease. The present study demonstrates the presence of OR mRNA and mRNA of obligated downstream components of OR signaling adenylyl cyclase 3 (ADYLC3) and olfactory G protein (Gnal) in the cerebral cortex of the mouse. Dysregulation of selected ORs and TASRs has been found in the entorhinal cortex and frontal cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a gradient compatible with Braak and Braak staging; frontal cortex in terminal stages of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy; and frontal cortex and cerebellum in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease subtypes methionine/methionine at codon 129 of PRNP (MM1) and valine/valine at codon 129 of PRNP (VV2). Altered OR, ADYLC3 and Gnal mRNA expression with disease progression has also been found in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, used as a model of AD. The function of these orphan receptors is not known, but probably related to cell signaling pathways responding to unidentified ligands. Variability in the drift, either down- or up-regulation, of dysregulated genes, suggests that central ORs and TASRs are vulnerable to variegated neurodegenerative diseases with cortical involvement, and that altered expression of ORs and TASRs is not a mere reflection of neuronal loss but rather a modulated pathological response.

23903258|t|[Increase in lipophilicity of enalaprilat by complexation with copper(II) or zinc(II) Ions].
23903258|a|Enalaprilat (H2L), which is the active metabolite of the pro-drug enalapril, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Some side effects such as neurodegeneration and taste disorder can be related to copper or zinc deficiency, which would be caused by the metal complex formation of dianionic elalaprilat (L(2-)). For a better understanding of this phenomenon, we investigated the solution species of enalaprilat in the presence of copper(II) or zinc(II) ions by pH titration analysis with I=0.10 M (NaCl) at 25C. The 1:1 complex formation constants (KML=[ML]/[M(2+)][L(2-)] M(-1)) of 10(7.4) for CuL and 10(4.4) for ZnL complexes were evaluated, indicating the presence of those complexes at a physiological pH. Furthermore, partition experiments with a two-phase system of 1-butanol/water at 25C disclosed that copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of enalaprilat were partially extracted into the organic layer. In the absence of those metal ions, enalaprilat was not soluble in the 1-butanol phase. The increase in lipophilicity of enalaprilat by metal complexation suggests that the long-term administration of enalapril could be a possible risk factor for the disrupted distribution of those metal ions in biological systems.

23948220|t|Clinical markers of early nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
23948220|a|BACKGROUND: Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is an early feature in alpha synucleinopathies and may precede other clinical manifestations of disease for several years. Olfactory dysfunction and mild motor abnormalities (MMAs) are highly prevalent in prodromal alpha synucleinopathies such as RBD and are suspected to be predictive neurodegenerative markers. Because both markers also are highly prevalent in the healthy elderly population, the discriminative value to detect an early neurodegenerative process is unclear. METHODS: We examined 28 patients with idiopathic RBD (iRBD) without manifest neurodegenerative disease to determine diagnostic accuracy of MMAs and olfactory dysfunction in identifying patients with early nigrostriatal degeneration in transcranial sonography (TCS) and (123)I-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography ((123)I-FP-CIT-SPECT). RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of our participants showed MMAs which were strongly associated with abnormal TCS and (123)I-FP-CIT-SPECT findings. The discriminative value in detecting participants with early nigrostriatal degeneration was excellent (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve, 0.84 [P<=.003] for TCS and 0.79 [P<=.066] for (123)I-FP-CIT-SPECT). Olfactory dysfunction was present in 78% of iRBD participants, but it was not linked with neuroimaging abnormalities or MMAs. Olfactory dysfunction did not discriminate participants with early nigrostriatal degeneration (area under the ROC curve, 0.54 [P<=.747] for TCS and 0.31 [P<=.225] for (123)I-FP-CIT-SPECT). Early RBD manifestation but no demographic (e.g., age, gender) or clinical characteristics of RBD (e.g., duration, severity of RBD) were associated with neuroimaging abnormalities in TCS and (123)I-FP-CIT-SPECT. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike olfactory dysfunction, MMAs discriminate patients with early nigrostriatal degeneration in iRBD. Early RBD manifestation seems to be an additional risk factor which aggravates neurodegenerative risk.

24131749|t|Olfactory dysfunction related to TDP-43 pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
24131749|a|AIMS: To clarify a possible contribution of TDP-43 pathology to odor dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. CASE REPORT: An 83-year-old woman suffered from muscle weakness, which started to deteriorate during the previous half year. In addition to her pyramidal signs, lower motor involvement was shown by needle electromyography; this upper and lower motor neuron involvement was suggestive of probable ALS. She presented with severe odor impairments but relatively preserved cognitive functions. Her autopsy findings revealed TDP-43-positive inclusions in the spinal motor neurons and cerebral limbic system without significant tau or alpha-synuclein deposits. DISCUSSION: This case showed evidence suggesting that olfactory dysfunction was probably related to limbic TDP-43 pathology and was possibly independent of her Alzheimer pathology. Olfactory dysfunction does not necessarily indicate the presence of tau or alpha-synuclein pathology and could be an early sign of ALS with the limbic involvement of TDP-43 pathology even when cognitive functions are preserved.

25340511|t|Mucuna pruriens (Velvet bean) rescues motor, olfactory, mitochondrial and synaptic impairment in PINK1B9 Drosophila melanogaster genetic model of Parkinson's disease.
25340511|a|The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) mutant for PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1B9) gene is a powerful tool to investigate physiopathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Using PINK1B9 mutant Dm we sought to explore the effects of Mucuna pruriens methanolic extract (Mpe), a L-Dopa-containing herbal remedy of PD. The effects of Mpe on PINK1B9 mutants, supplied with standard diet to larvae and adults, were assayed on 3-6 (I), 10-15 (II) and 20-25 (III) days old flies. Mpe 0.1% significantly extended lifespan of PINK1B9 and fully rescued olfactory response to 1-hexanol and improved climbing behavior of PINK1B9 of all ages; in contrast, L-Dopa (0.01%, percentage at which it is present in Mpe 0.1%) ameliorated climbing of only PINK1B9 flies of age step II. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of antennal lobes and thoracic ganglia of PINK1B9 revealed that Mpe restored to wild type (WT) levels both T-bars and damaged mitochondria. Western blot analysis of whole brain showed that Mpe, but not L-Dopa on its own, restored bruchpilot (BRP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression to age-matched WT control levels. These results highlight multiple sites of action of Mpe, suggesting that its effects cannot only depend upon its L-Dopa content and support the clinical observation of Mpe as an effective medication with intrinsic ability of delaying the onset of chronic L-Dopa-induced long-term motor complications. Overall, this study strengthens the relevance of using PINK1B9 Dm as a translational model to study the properties of Mucuna pruriens for PD treatment.

25369874|t|Caring for early-onset dementia with excessive wandering of over 30 kilometres per day: a case report.
25369874|a|Excessive wandering in people in dementia is associated with a severe care burden. However, the quantification of excessive wandering has not been described, and its cause and treatment have not been evaluated with objective measurements to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pharmacological treatments and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce excessive wandering in an early-onset Alzheimer disease patient with objective indicators. Wandering was quantified using an integrated circuit monitoring system that measured the distance moved and the location of the patient. Monitoring was conducted in the dementia ward of a general hospital in 2012. Sleep quality was measured by non-wear actigraphy. The study was approved by the ethics committees of the Osaka University School of Allied Health Science, and of the study hospital. The case involved a 62-year-old woman diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer disease and hospitalized in 2012 because of irritability and agitation; her Mini-Mental State Examination score was 5/30 and her Clinical Dementia Rating score was 3. When olanzapine (2.5 mg) was prescribed, she developed insomnia, and her wandering movements increased from 10 to 20 km/day. On some days, it exceeded 30 km/day, and she walked most of the night. She did not experience weight loss or physical exhaustion, but she sustained a minor injury in her left sole. Olanzapine was increased to 7.5 mg, but these problems persisted. Nursing staff discovered triggers for wandering and insomnia, including high sensitivity to odour and noise in the living room or her room. When the environment was changed to meet her needs, the distance moved per day decreased to <15 km and the sleep disturbances disappeared. This case demonstrated the difficulty in assessing the degree of ambulation and sleep disorder. Objective indicators are essential in evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

25933387|t|TDP-43 Pathology Progression Along the Olfactory Pathway as a Possible Substrate for Olfactory Impairment in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
25933387|a|Odor impairment and its relationship with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have not been fully elucidated. We performed the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) in 18 ALS patients and in 18 controls. The score was significantly decreased (6.6 +- 2.7) in the patients versus the controls (9.2 +- 2.4) (U = 77.0, p = 0.007). This decrement of the OSIT-J score paralleled the cognitive decline. We then studied samples from a series of 42 postmortem ALS cases. Quantitative analyses demonstrated that TDP-43-positive inclusions were most frequent in the hippocampus and least abundant in the olfactory bulb and were of intermediate density in the primary olfactory cortex. This centrifugal gradient suggests that TDP-43 pathology starts in the hippocampus, spreads into the primary olfactory center, and finally reaches the olfactory bulb. TDP-43, tau, and alpha-synuclein accumulations appeared to be independent. These observations suggest that impaired odor discrimination in ALS patients may be related to TDP-43-positive lesions affecting predominantly secondary olfactory centers (especially the hippocampus) in contrast to decreased odor sensitivity in Parkinson disease in which alpha-synuclein pathology mainly involves the peripheral region (i.e., olfactory bulb). We suggest that detectable odor impairments in ALS patients are useful for predicting the presence of TDP-43 pathology in the extramotor system.

26556259|a|Dementia is an umbrella term for a set of symptoms that include memory loss, changes in mood and problems with reasoning, attention and communication. It is a progressive condition and there is ample evidence that oral health declines as the severity of dementia increases. Most of this decline is attributable to the effects of cognitive impairment on oral hygiene capability and/or acceptance of help from others in supporting oral hygiene. Factors such as altered salivary flow, taste change, use of high-energy food supplements and syrup-based medications also contribute to the risk of oral and dental diseases. In its role as part of the wider health and social care network, the primary dental care team can make an important contribution to securing the oral health of people living with dementia.

26873234|t|[Impairment of Odor Recognition in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1].
26873234|a|There is evidence that impaired human cognitive abilities are reflected in loss of olfactory abilities. Declining olfactory perception may be a biomarker for impairment of cognitive function and of impending illnesses in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we reported that patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1) had lower sensitivity to emotional facial expressions as well as abnormal olfactory threshold or recognition level. In DM 1, pathological studies have reported neurofibrillary tangles in several temporal areas including the entorhinal cortex (ENT), hippocampus (HI), and the amygdala. We observed that patients with DM 1 showed signal abnormalities in the olfactory limbic areas on magnetic resonance imaging. Our findings underscore the need to pay careful attention to significant decreases in odor identification abilities caused by diverse forms of abnormal brain function, especially in the AMG, ENT and HI.

26876109|t|[A case of myasthenia gravis with transient taste disorders followed by aplastic anemia after thymectomy].
26876109|a|A 45-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of taste disorders in March 2014. He exhibited cervical muscle weakness and left eye ptosis, which responded to Tensilon test, and was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). He developed aspiration pneumonia and myasthenic crisis, which was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid pulse therapy. All symptoms disappeared. Oral administration of prednisolone and tacrolimus was started. Chest CT revealed thymoma and extended thymectomy was performed in May 2014. In December 2014, seven months after the thymectomy, hematological examination showed pancytopenia including severe neutropenia. We diagnosed his illness as aplastic anemia (AA). Cyclosporine therapy with transfusion was administerd and led to reticulocyte count recovery. Since May 2015, hemoglobin recovery reached a blood transfusion free period. To our knowledge, this is the first case report with the patient supposed of relationship among taste disorders, AA and thymoma-associated MG.

27637804|t|Chronic mild stress accelerates the progression of Parkinson's disease in A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice.
27637804|a|Daily stress is associated with increased risk for various diseases, and numerous studies have provided evidence that environmental stress leads to deleterious effects on the central nervous system. However, it remains unclear whether chronic stress exacerbates the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate this hypothesis, we determined the effect of chronic mild stress (CMS) on the pathogenesis of PD in a transgenic mice line that overexpresses the human A53T mutant alpha-synuclein (A53T Tg mice). We show that when exposed to CMS, male, but not female, A53T Tg mice developed profound motor disabilities and exhibited olfactory sensitivity deficits. Pathological analysis also identified robust dopaminergic neuron degeneration and strong reduction of dopamine levels in A53T Tg male mice who underwent CMS treatment. Systematic examination of the abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein revealed a profound increase of inclusion in A53T Tg male mice subject to CMS resembling key pathological changes of PD. An insight into the mechanism underlying stress leading to the acceleration of neurodegeneration in those with genetic susceptibility, was revealed by evidence of microglia activation and elevated pro-inflammatory factor levels in A53T Tg male mice following CMS. Notably, these effects of CMS on the pathogenesis of PD showed a remarkable sexual dimorphism: only male A53T Tg mice exhibited exacerbation of the progression of PD. However, the molecular and cellular bases for this difference remains to be elucidated. Our results indicate a causative role for chronic mild stress using a PD animal model. Based on these findings, we propose that CMS acts as an environmental risk factor that leads to neuroinflammation and progressive neurodegeneration on a background of PD susceptibility.

27890451|t|Sniffing the diagnosis: Olfactory testing in neurodegenerative parkinsonism.
27890451|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic utility of olfactory testing in patients with neurodegenerative parkinsonism. METHODS: The Sniffin' Sticks test battery for assessment of odor identification, discrimination, and threshold was applied to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) as well as healthy controls (HC). Two different cohorts were analyzed: A PD/healthy control that included PD patients and HC as well as a PD/diseased control cohort for which patients PD, MSA and PSP were recruited. The former cohort was exploited to calculate cut-off values that discriminate PD patients from HC with a sensitivity (sensitivity-weighted cut-off) or specificity (specificity-weighted cut-off) exceeding 95%, respectively. The PD/diseased controls cohort was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy using these cut-off values in discriminating patients with neurodegenerative parkinsonism. RESULTS: PD patients (n = 67) performed significantly worse in olfactory testing than HC (n = 41) and patients with MSA (n = 23) or PSP (n = 23). There was no significant difference in olfactory function between MSA and PSP patients. Diagnostic performance of the identification subscore was similar to the sum score of the Sniffin' Sticks test (AUC identification test 0.94, AUC sum score 0.96), while threshold and discrimination subscores were inferior. In patients with parkinsonism, the specificity-weighted cut-off predicted a diagnosis of PD with a sensitivity and specificity of 76.6 and 87.0%, respectively. The discriminative value of this cut-off in separating PD from MSA was 76.7% (sensitivity) and 95.7% (specificity). The corresponding, prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value of olfactory testing exceeded 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that assessment of olfactory function, particularly odor identification, can be useful to discriminate PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders, particularly MSA patients.

28112682|t|Nasal neuron PET imaging quantifies neuron generation and degeneration.
28112682|a|Olfactory dysfunction is broadly associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases and predicts increased mortality rates in healthy individuals. Conventional measurements of olfactory health assess odor processing pathways within the brain and provide a limited understanding of primary odor detection. Quantification of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which detect odors within the nasal cavity, would provide insight into the etiology of olfactory dysfunction associated with disease and mortality. Notably, OSNs are continually replenished by adult neurogenesis in mammals, including humans, so OSN measurements are primed to provide specialized insights into neurological disease. Here, we have evaluated a PET radiotracer, [11C]GV1-57, that specifically binds mature OSNs and quantifies the mature OSN population in vivo. [11C]GV1-57 monitored native OSN population dynamics in rodents, detecting OSN generation during postnatal development and aging-associated neurodegeneration. [11C]GV1-57 additionally measured rates of neuron regeneration after acute injury and early-stage OSN deficits in a rodent tauopathy model of neurodegenerative disease. Preliminary assessment in nonhuman primates suggested maintained uptake and saturable binding of [18F]GV1-57 in primate nasal epithelium, supporting its translational potential. Future applications for GV1-57 include monitoring additional diseases or conditions associated with olfactory dysregulation, including cognitive decline, as well as monitoring effects of neuroregenerative or neuroprotective therapeutics.

28174404|t|[Two Cases of Invasive Thymoma with Taste Disorder].
28174404|a|Two 50s female patients with the taste disorder of sweet taste loss and stage IV a type B2 invasive thymoma underwent surgery at our hospital. One patient with myasthenia gravis (MG) developed postoperative myasthenic crisis and recovered by the treatment with plasma apheresis and steroid pulse therapy. Her taste disorder fully recovered together with her MG symptom. The taste disorder of the other patient without MG had persisted for 3 years after the surgery. The taste disorder of sweet taste loss was reported as one of non-motor symptoms caused by MG-related autoimmune mechanisms associated with thymoma, improving with the therapy for MG. Anti-Kv 1.4 antibody was reported to be positive in nearly half patients with the taste disorder and MG and is speculated to affect selectively the sweet taste receptor.

28180961|t|Dermal phospho-alpha-synuclein deposits confirm REM sleep behaviour disorder as prodromal Parkinson's disease.
28180961|a|Phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-alpha-syn) deposits, one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD), have recently been detected in dermal nerve fibres in PD patients with good specificity and sensitivity. Here, we studied whether p-alpha-syn may serve as a biomarker in patients with a high risk of developing PD, such as those with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We compared the presence and distribution of p-alpha-syn deposits in dermal nerve fibres in 18 patients with RBD, 25 patients with early PD and 20 normal controls. Skin biopsy was taken at C7, Th10, and the upper and lower leg. Presynaptic dopamine transporter imaging using FP-CIT-SPECT was performed in all patients with RBD and in 11 patients with PD. All RBD patients underwent olfactory function testing. The likelihood ratio (LR) for prodromal PD was calculated for each patient based on published research criteria. Skin serial sections were assessed by double-immunofluorescence labelling with antibodies to pSer129-alpha-syn under blinded conditions. P-alpha-syn was visualized in 10/18 patients with RBD (sensitivity of 55.6%) and in 20/25 early PD patients (sensitivity of 80%) but in none of the controls (specificity of 100%). The percentage of dermal structures innervated by p-alpha-syn-positive fibres was negatively correlated with dopamine transporter binding in the FP-CIT-SPECT (rho = -0.377, p = 0.048), with olfactory function (rho = -0.668, p = 0.002), and positively correlated with the total LR for RBD to present prodromal PD (rho = 0.531, p = 0.023). Dermal p-alpha-syn can be considered a peripheral histopathological marker of synucleinopathy and can be detected in a subgroup of RBD patients presumably representing prodromal PD. Dermal p-alpha-syn is detectable in RBD patients without PD motor symptoms, thereby stratifying a patient group that is of great interest for clinical trials testing disease-modifying drugs.

28576705|t|The pathogenic LRRK2 R1441C mutation induces specific deficits modeling the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease in the mouse.
28576705|a|The aim of the present study was to further explore the in vivo function of the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-gene, which is mutated in certain familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). We generated a mouse model harboring the disease-associated point mutation R1441C in the GTPase domain of the endogenous murine LRRK2 gene (LRRK2 R1441C line) and performed a comprehensive analysis of these animals throughout lifespan in comparison with an existing knockdown line of LRRK2 (LRRK2 knockdown line). Animals of both lines do not exhibit severe motor dysfunction or pathological signs of neurodegeneration neither at young nor old age. However, at old age the homozygous LRRK2 R1441C animals exhibit clear phenotypes related to the prodromal phase of PD such as impairments in fine motor tasks, gait, and olfaction. These phenotypes are only marginally observable in the LRRK2 knockdown animals, possibly due to activation of compensatory mechanisms as suggested by in vitro studies of synaptic transmission. Thus, at the organismal level the LRRK2 R1441C mutation does not emerge as a loss of function of the protein, but induces mutation specific deficits. Furthermore, judged by the phenotypes presented, the LRRK2-R1441C knock-in line is a valid preclinical model for the prodromal phase of PD.

28679601|t|Prospective clinical and DaT-SPECT imaging in premotor LRRK2 G2019S-associated Parkinson disease.
28679601|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of baseline clinical and imaging biomarkers in a cohort of asymptomatic LRRK2 G2019S carriers for predicting conversion to Parkinson disease (PD) at 4 years. METHODS: Thirty-two asymptomatic carriers of LRRK2 G2019S mutation underwent baseline and 4-year evaluation including clinical examination (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III, olfaction University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT]) and dopamine transporter (DaT) SPECT (123I-ioflupane). Visual and semiquantitative analysis of images was performed. The specific striatal binding ratio was calculated (striatal region of interest [ROI] - occipital ROI/occipital ROI). RESULTS: Three carriers, asymptomatic at baseline, had converted to PD at 4-year evaluation. Twenty-three participants were fully evaluated. PD converters had lower striatal DaT binding at baseline than nonconverters (p = 0.002). A baseline scan with a ratio of bilateral striatal uptake below 1 predicted conversion to PD within the 4-year period with high sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve 1; p = 0.006). The slope of DaT binding decline between the 2 scans was similar in PD converters and nonconverters. Age-adjusted UPSIT score at baseline and at 4 years was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative DaT-SPECT could be used to predict early conversion to PD in asymptomatic carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. Rate of conversion to PD at 4 years in this cohort aged ~64 years was 12%. The slope of DaT binding decline on DaT-SPECT imaging seems to be similar across different stages of the premotor period.

28805588|t|Weight in Parkinson's Disease: Phenotypical Significance.
28805588|a|Body weight in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a significant nonmotor feature. Weight homeostasis is a complex physiological process and gets deranged in PD patients leading to changes in weight. While both the low and high body weight have been reported as risk factors for PD, the majority of PD patients have a lower weight and a subset of patients lose weight during the course of the disease, while a small proportion gain weight. A number of clinical parameters such as older age, impaired cognition, severity of disease, and an imbalance of food intake determined by satiety and hunger hormones have been reported to be associated with but not the cause of weight change. Low body weight and weight loss have a negative impact on disease severity, dyskinesia quality of life, and mortality indicative of disease progression. An early assessment of olfactory impairment seems to identify patients at risk of weight loss, the patients with more severe olfactory loss-anosmic group, lose weight as compared to the patients with some preservation of olfaction, the hyposmic group. Higher levodopa dose per kilogram body weight increases the risk of dyskinesia, higher body weight seems to be protective against this complication. The identification of PD patients according to the nonmotor phenotype of "Park-olfaction-weight-phenotype" and the "olfaction-weight-dyskinesia" triad should help to develop strategies to prevent weight reduction and improve general health and complications of PD patients. The phenotype seems to reflect a differential prodromal pathology and influence clinical disease. Higher body weight patients would benefit from life style changes to achieve a healthy profile. Weight monitoring and weight orientated approach to management of PD patients should help to improve their outcome. Body weight change might be a surrogate to disease progression and may be used to investigate neuroprotection strategies.

28918258|t|Olfactory function in an excitotoxic model for secondary neuronal degeneration: Role of dopaminergic interneurons.
28918258|a|Secondary neuronal degeneration (SND) occurring in Traumatic brain injury (TBI) consists in downstream destructive events affecting cells that were not or only marginally affected by the initial wound, further increasing the effects of the primary injury. Glutamate excitotoxicity is hypothesized to play an important role in SND. TBI is a common cause of olfactory dysfunction that may be spontaneous and partially recovered. The role of the glutamate excitotoxicity in the TBI-induced olfactory dysfunction is still unknown. We investigated the effects of excitotoxicity induced by bilateral N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) OB administration in the olfactory function, OB volumes, and subventricular zone (SVZ) and OB neurogenesis in rats. NMDA OB administration induced a decrease in the number of correct choices in the olfactory discrimination tests one week after lesions (p<0.01), and a spontaneous recovery of the olfactory deficit two weeks after lesions (p<0.05). A lack of correlation between OB volumes and olfactory function was observed. An increase in SVZ neurogenesis (Ki67+ cells, PSANCAM+ cells (p<0.01) associated with an increase in OB glomerular dopaminergic immunostaining (p<0.05) were related to olfactory function recovery. The present results show that changes in OB volumes cannot explain the recovery of the olfactory function and suggest a relevant role for dopaminergic OB interneurons in the pathophysiology of recovery of loss of smell in TBI.

29164380|t|Correlation between the availability of dopamine transporter and olfactory function in healthy subjects.
29164380|a|OBJECTIVES: Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is usually prodromal to other symptoms. In this study, we aimed to explore the association of olfactory function with the availabilities of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) in healthy subjects. METHODS: Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database ( www.ppmi-info.org/data ). The study population consisted of healthy controls with screening 123I-FP-CIT single photon emission tomography (SPECT). University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was assessed to evaluate the olfactory function. RESULTS: Totally, 181 healthy subjects (117 male, 64 female) with 123I-FP-CIT SPECT data were included in this study. Specific binding ratios (SBRs) of the caudate nucleus (rho = -0.4217, p < 0.0001), putamen (rho = -0.2292, p = 0.0019), and striatum (rho=-0.3425, p < 0.0001) showed a reduction with ageing. SBRs of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and striatum were positively correlated with UPSIT (rho = 0.3716, p < 0.0001; rho = 0.3655, p < 0.0001; rho = 0.3880, p < 0.0001). After controlling for age by partial correlation, SBRs of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and striatum showed an influence on UPSIT (rho = 0.3288, p < 0.0001; rho = 0.3374, p < 0.0001; rho = 0.3511, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Olfactory function is associated with the availability of striatal DAT independent of age in healthy subjects. KEY POINTS:   Olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is prodromal to other symptoms.   The availability of dopamine transporter showed a reduction with ageing.   Olfactory function is associated with the availability of dopamine transporter.

30222597|t|Olfaction in female Wistar rats is influenced by dopaminergic periglomerular neurons after nigral and bulbar lesions.
30222597|a|Hyposmia is found in Parkinsonian patients decades before the onset of motor disorders. The same occurs with sleep disorders, especially infuencing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which affect a large percentage of people who have Parkinson's disease. These two disturbances presumably are closely related to a dopaminergic dysfunction. Therefore, we propose that selective lesions, induced by rotenone, of the periglomerular neurons within the olfactory bulb or of the nigrostriatal pathway could result in hyposmia. In addition, we hypothesized that REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) could have potential to generate a synergistic olfactory impairment in both lesion paradigms. The results indicated that rotenone-induced nigrostriatal lesions in female Wistar rats were associated with odor preference changes, similar to hedonic tone impairment, but without a supposed potentiation triggered by REMSD. The nigrostriatal injury negatively affected olfaction performance, which was counteracted, functionally, by REMSD. However, injury to periglomerular neurons was less influenced by REMSD, as olfactory performance was restored after rebound sleep. We conclude that female rats present a pattern of olfactory discrimination/preference that is dependent on the activities of the nigrostriatal and the main olfactory pathways.

30651382|t|Impaired olfaction is associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in the brain.
30651382|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine whether impaired olfaction is associated with cognitive decline and indicators of neurodegeneration in the brain of dementia-free older adults. METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 380 dementia-free participants (mean age = 78 years) were followed for up to 15 years, and underwent MRI scans. Olfactory function was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) at baseline, and categorized as anosmia (B-SIT <6), hyposmia (B-SIT 6-10 in men and 6-10.25 in women), and normal (B-SIT 10.25-12 in men and 10.5-12 in women). Cognitive function was annually assessed with a battery of 21 tests, from which composite scores were derived. Structural total and regional brain volumes were estimated. Data were analyzed using linear regression and mixed-effects models. RESULTS: At study entry, 138 (36.3%) had normal olfactory function, 213 (56.1%) had hyposmia, and 29 (7.6%) had anosmia. In multiadjusted mixed-effects models, hyposmia (beta = -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.05 to -0.02) and anosmia (beta = -0.13, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.09) were associated with faster rate of cognitive decline compared to normal olfaction. On MRI, impaired olfaction (hyposmia or anosmia) was related to smaller volumes of the hippocampus (beta = -0.19, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.05), and in the entorhinal (beta = -0.16, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.08), fusiform (beta = -0.45, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.14), and middle temporal (beta = -0.38, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.01) cortices. CONCLUSION: Impaired olfaction predicts faster cognitive decline and might indicate neurodegeneration in the brain among dementia-free older adults.

31035288|t|Relationship Between Poor Olfaction and Mortality Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Cohort Study.
31035288|a|Background: Poor olfaction is common among older adults and has been linked to higher mortality. However, most studies have had a relatively short follow-up and have not explored potential explanations. Objective: To assess poor olfaction in relation to mortality in older adults and to investigate potential explanations. Design: Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting: 2 U.S. communities. Participants: 2289 adults aged 71 to 82 years at baseline (37.7% black persons and 51.9% women). Measurements: Brief Smell Identification Test in 1999 or 2000 (baseline) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality at 3, 5, 10, and 13 years after baseline. Results: During follow-up, 1211 participants died by year 13. Compared with participants with good olfaction, those with poor olfaction had a 46% higher cumulative risk for death at year 10 (risk ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.67]) and a 30% higher risk at year 13 (risk ratio, 1.30 [CI, 1.18 to 1.42]). Similar associations were found in men and women and in white and black persons. However, the association was evident among participants who reported excellent to good health at baseline (for example, 10-year mortality risk ratio, 1.62 [CI, 1.37 to 1.90]) but not among those who reported fair to poor health (10-year mortality risk ratio, 1.06 [CI, 0.82 to 1.37]). In analyses of cause-specific mortality, poor olfaction was associated with higher mortality from neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Mediation analyses showed that neurodegenerative diseases explained 22% and weight loss explained 6% of the higher 10-year mortality among participants with poor olfaction. Limitation: No data were collected on change in olfaction and its relationship to mortality. Conclusion: Poor olfaction is associated with higher long-term mortality among older adults, particularly those with excellent to good health at baseline. Neurodegenerative diseases and weight loss explain only part of the increased mortality. Primary Funding Source: National Institutes of Health and Michigan State University.

31221723|t|Evolution of prodromal parkinsonian features in a cohort of GBA mutation-positive individuals: a 6-year longitudinal study.
31221723|a|OBJECTIVES: GBA1 mutations are a frequent risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical features in a group of GBA1 mutation-positive individuals over a 6-year follow-up. METHODS: This is a longitudinal study on a cohort of GBA1-positive carriers. We enrolled 31 patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD), 29 GBA1 heterozygous carriers (Het GBA group) and 30 controls (HC) at baseline and followed them for 6 years. We assessed baseline motor and non-motor signs of PD in all subjects using clinical questionnaires and scales (reduced Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS), Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCA), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), REM Sleep Behavior Disorder screening questionnaire (RBDsq), Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscale (MDS-UPDRS III) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We repeated these at the 6-year follow-up alongside venous blood sampling for measurement of glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity (GCase). We explored whether the GCase activity level was altered in leucocytes of these subjects and how it was related to development of PD. RESULTS: We observed a significant worsening in UMSARS, RBDsq, MDS-UPDRS III and BDI scores at the 6-year follow-up compared with baseline in both the GD and Het GBA groups. Intergroup comparisons showed that GD subjects had significantly worse scores in UPSIT, UMSARS, MoCA and MDS-UPDRS III than HC, while Het GBA displayed worse outcomes in UPSIT and MDS-UPDRS III compared with HC. In GBA1 mutation-positive individuals (Het GBA and GD), an UPSIT score of 23 at baseline was correlated with worse outcome at 6 years in UPSIT, MoCA, MDS-UPDRS III and BDI. CONCLUSION: In this 6-year-long longitudinal study, GBA1 mutation-positive subjects showed a worsening in motor and non-motor prodromal PD features.

31468077|t|Influence of intranasal exposure of MPTP in multiple doses on liver functions and transition from non-motor to motor symptoms in a rat PD model.
31468077|a|Besides the effects on the striatum, the impairment of visceral organs including liver functions has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, it is yet unclear if liver functions are affected in the early stage of the disease before the motor phase has appeared. The aim of our present study was thus to assess the effect of intranasal administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in different doses on striatum and liver functions. Deterioration of non-motor activities appeared on single exposure to MPTP along with rise in striatum oxidative stress and decline in antioxidant levels. Decreases in dopamine, noradrenaline, and GABA and increase in serotonin were detected in striatum. Motor coordination was impaired with a single dose of MPTP, and with repeated MPTP exposure, there was further significant impairment. Locomotor activity was affected from second exposure of MPTP, and the impairment increased with third MPTP exposure. Impairment of liver function through increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was observed after first MPTP insult, and it worsened with second and third administrations. First administration of MPTP triggered systemic inflammation showing significant increase in inflammatory markers in the liver. Our data shows for the first time that an intranasal route of entry of MPTP affects liver from the non-motor phase of PD itself, occurring concomitantly with the reduction of striatal dopamine. It also suggests that a single dose is not enough to bring about progression of the disease from non-motor to locomotor deficiency, and a repeated dose is needed to establish the motor severity phase in the rat intranasal MPTP model.

31535271|t|Neocortical Lewy bodies are associated with impaired odor identification in community-dwelling elders without clinical PD.
31535271|a|BACKGROUND: The association of Lewy bodies (LBs) with olfactory dysfunction was investigated in community-dwelling elders without clinical Parkinson's disease (PD) using the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), a standard measure of odor identification. METHODS: 280 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project completed the BSIT annually. Lewy bodies were detected in 13 brain regions by immunohistochemistry and were assigned to the Braak PD stages 1-6. RESULTS: Of the 280 participants, 101 (36.1%) had LBs which were maximal in the olfactory bulb and tract (85.1%) and least in Heschl's cortex (21.8%). Due to the small number of cases in Braak PD stages 2, 3 and 5, the distribution of LBs in the 6 Braak PD stages was contracted into 3 main LB stages: (1) LBs in olfactory bulbs and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, (2) further extension of LBs to limbic and other brainstem regions and (3) additional extension of LBs to neocortical areas. MMSE, global cognition and odor test scores were lower and frequency of dementia was higher at the time of the last valid BSIT, in cases with LBs as compared to those without LBs. Linear regression analyses showed that LBs were associated with impaired olfaction. However, on stratification of LBs into 3 stages, only the stage 3 cases were independently associated with impaired olfaction. CONCLUSION: Although LB pathology was detected in olfactory bulbs in the early stage of LB progression (stage 1), the strongest association of LBs with olfactory dysfunction was observed in the late pathological stage (stage 3) when LBs extended to neocortical areas.

32529488|t|Upregulation of Cathepsins in Olfactory Bulbs Is Associated with Transient Olfactory Dysfunction in Mice with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.
32529488|a|Cathepsins are a family of lysosomal/endosomal proteolytic enzymes that include serine, aspartate, and cysteine proteases. The role of cathepsin in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, remains elusive. We evaluated the expression level and localization of different cathepsins in the olfactory bulbs of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of human multiple sclerosis. Quantitative real-time PCR results and Western blotting analyses revealed that serine, aspartate, and cysteine cathepsins are expressed at significantly higher levels in the olfactory bulbs of mice with EAE in the paralytic stage compared with those of control mice. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that cathepsin A, D, and S were expressed in the glomerulus layer, external plexiform layer, and mitral cell layer. Furthermore, cathepsins were detected in astrocytes, microglia, inflammatory cells, and vascular cells in the olfactory bulb of EAE mice at the paralytic stage. Collectively, these results suggest that the upregulation of cathepsins in the olfactory bulb of mice with EAE is associated with transient olfactory dysfunction in autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

32631425|t|The insula, a grey matter of tastes: a volumetric MRI study in dementia with Lewy bodies.
32631425|a|BACKGROUND: Despite the growing number of discoveries during the past decades about its functions, the insula remains a mysterious 'island'. In addition to its involvement in basic functions such as gustation and interoception, the insular cortex is now considered a key region for integrated functions such as emotion/motivation processing, decision-making and self-consciousness. We hypothesized that this structure, standing at the crossroads of such functions, could ground personal tastes in general, beyond food preferences and aesthetic judgements. Given that dementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by a focal atrophy within the insular cortex from the early stages, this condition provides an opportunity to test such a hypothesis. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire to assess potential changes in personal tastes, submitted it to a cohort of 23 patients with early-stage dementia with Lewy bodies and compared their questionnaire results to those of 20 age-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, we performed a global and regional neuroimaging study to test for a potential correlation between the patients' scores for changes in personal tastes and their insular cortex volumes. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the patients presented significant changes in personal tastes compared to the controls, in both food and non-food domains. Moreover, imaging analyses confirmed the involvement of the insular cortex atrophy in the changes in personal tastes using global analysis, and in both food and non-food domains using regional analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results bring new insights into the role of the insula as a 'grey matter of tastes', this structure supporting personal preferences in general, beyond the food domain. The insular cortex could be involved through its role in motivational processes by the representation of subjective awareness of bodily states during the phenomenological experience of stimulus appraisal. However, we also argue that it could support the abstract representations of personal tastes as self-concepts, acutely exemplifying embodied cognition. Finally, the questionnaire on changes in tastes could constitute an interesting tool to help early diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies and to assess insular dysfunction more generally.

32697344|t|COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: A possible associative approach towards neurodegenerative diseases.
32697344|a|The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has kept the globe in disquiets due to its severe life-threatening conditions. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath. According to the anecdotal reports from the health care workers, it has been suggested that the virus could reach the brain and can cause anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and hypopsia. Once the SARS-CoV-2 has entered the central nervous system (CNS), it can either exit in an inactive form in the tissues or may lead to neuroinflammation. Here, we aim to discuss the chronic infection of the olfactory bulb region of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 and how this could affect the nearby residing neurons in the host. We further review the probable cellular mechanism and activation of the microglia 1 phenotype possibly leading to various neurodegenerative disorders. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 might probably infect the olfactory bulb neuron enervating the nasal epithelium accessing the CNS and might cause neurodegenerative diseases in the future.

32946938|t|Genetic variants of TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor associate with distinct gut microbiota traits in Parkinson's disease: A pilot study.
32946938|a|The non-tasting form of the bitter taste receptor, TAS2R38, has been shown as a genetic risk factor associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Specific taste receptors that are expressed in the lower gastrointestinal tract may respond to alteration in gut microbiota composition, detecting bacterial molecules, and regulate immune responses. Given the importance of brain-gut-microbiota axis and gene-environment interactions in PD, we investigate the associations between the genetic variants of TAS2R38 and gut microbiota composition in 39 PD patients. The results confirm that the majority of PD patients have reduced sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and are carriers of at least one non-functional TAS2R38 AVI haplotype. Moreover, we found this correlation to be associated with a reduction in bacteria alpha-diversity with a predominant reduction of Clostridium genus. We hypothesised that the high frequency of the non-taster form of TAS2R38 associated with a diminuition of Clostridium bacteria in PD might determine a reduction in the activation of protective signalling-molecules useful in preserving gut homeostasis. This pilot study, by identifying a decrease in specific bacteria associated with a reduced sensitivity to PROP, adds essential information that opens new avenues of research into the association of PD microbiota composition and sensory modification.

33521981|t|Dysphagia management in Parkinson's disease: Comparison of the effect of thickening agents on taste, aroma, and texture.
33521981|a|Dysphagia is a frequent symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Thickening liquids facilitates safe swallowing, however, low treatment compliance is a major issue, due to patients' dislike of thickened liquids. Some studies suggest a negative impact of gum-based thickeners, currently most used in clinical practice, on sensory properties compared to starch-based thickeners. This has not yet been investigated in PD. This study's aim was to compare taste, texture, and aroma of gum-based and starch-based thickened soups in participants with PD. Gum-based resource thicken up clear (RTUC) and starch-based kitchen products potato starch (PS) and quinoa flour (QF) were evaluated in broccoli soup. Texture, aroma, and taste were characterized by rheology, volatile, and sensory profiling. Thickened soups were evaluated in participants with PD and controls through a paired comparison test. Reduced release of 61.4%, 46.2%, and 38.5% of volatiles was observed after thickening with RTUC, PS, and QF, respectively. Overall taste intensity was reduced in RTUC- and PS-thickened soup, respectively. Taste and aroma of PS-thickened soup were considered more intense by 70.3% and 63.8% of all participants, respectively (n = 36 PD, n = 41 controls), 56.3% preferred the PS-thickened soup's texture . Taste and aroma of QF-thickened soup were considered more intense by 68.1% and 65.6% of all participants, respectively (n = 47 PD, n = 31 controls), 58.0% preferred the QF-thickened soup's texture. Starch-based thickeners demonstrated higher taste and aroma intensity. However, volatile and sensory profiling demonstrated reduced taste and aroma in all thickeners. Combining kitchen products with flavor enhancers may increase palatability of thickened beverages.

34227728|t|'They're getting a taste of our world': A qualitative study of people with multiple sclerosis' experiences of accessing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Australian Capital Territory.
34227728|a|BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (MS), who are often immunocompromised, require complex care and engage with a variety of health-care providers to manage their health. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate people with MS' experiences of accessing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. DESIGN: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Eight adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS participated in telephone or video call interviews between June and July 2020. RESULTS: Participants were aware that having MS made them more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19. In some cases, usual care was postponed or not sought. Some circumstances warranted the risk of a face-to-face consultation. Benefits of telehealth consultations included improved access, convenience and being contact-free. In comparison with video consultations, those via telephone were considered less personal and limited capacity to read body language, and for physical examination. Most participants hoped to incorporate telehealth into their future health-care routines. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Personal risk assessment and trust in health-care professionals are determinants of the mode through which people with MS accessed health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has been a valuable tool to mitigate COVID-19 transmission through enabling contact-free consultations. People with MS may find specific value in video consultations, which enable visualization of physical function. There is a need for training and support for all clinicians to conduct remote consultations. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was conducted by a team comprised of four people with MS, a neurologist and four health services researchers.

34232538|t|Sensory perception of environmental cues as a modulator of aging and neurodegeneration: Insights from Caenorhabditis elegans.
34232538|a|Environmental stimuli such as temperature, food, and smell significantly influence the physiology and behavior of animals. Animals are differentially adapted to maintain their internal body functions in response to varied environmental conditions. These external cues are sensed by specialized neurons which are a part of the chemosensory and thermosensory systems. The inability to respond correctly to varied environmental conditions may result in compromised bodily functions and reduced longevity. For example, the ability to sense food is derived from the integrated action of olfactory and gustatory systems. The damage to the olfactory system will affect our decision of palatable food items which in turn can affect the response of the gustatory system, ultimately causing abnormal feeding habits. Recent studies have provided evidence that aging is regulated by sensory perception of environment. Aging is one of the most common causes of various neurodegenerative diseases and the perception of environmental cues is also found to regulate the development of neurodegenerative phenotype in several animal models. However, specific molecular signaling pathways involved in the process are not completely understood. The research conducted on one of the best-studied animal models of aging, Caenorhabditis elegans, has demonstrated multiple examples of gene-environment interaction at the neuronal level which affects life span. The findings may be useful to identify the key neuronal regulators of aging and age-related diseases in humans owing to conserved core metabolic and aging pathways from worms to humans.

34348192|t|Olfaction, cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration, and cognition in early Parkinson disease.
34348192|a|INTRODUCTION: Impaired olfaction and reduced cholinergic nucleus 4 (Ch4) volume both predict greater cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined the relationship between olfaction, longitudinal change in cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei and their target regions, and cognition in early PD. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 97 PD participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative with brain MRIs at baseline, 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years. Using probabilistic maps, regional grey matter density (GMD) was calculated for Ch4, cholinergic nuclei 1, 2, and 3 (Ch123), and their target regions. RESULTS: Baseline University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test score correlated with change in GMD of all regions of interest (all p < 0.05). Rate of change of Ch4 GMD was correlated with rate of change of Ch123 (p = 0.034), cortex (p = 0.001), and amygdala GMD (p < 0.001), but not hippocampus GMD (p = 0.38). Rate of change of Ch123 GMD was correlated with rate of change of cortex (p = 0.001) and hippocampus (p < 0.001), but not amygdala GMD (p = 0.133). In a linear regression model including change in GMD of all regions of interest and age as predictors, change in cortex GMD (beta slope= 38.2; 95 % CI: [0.47, 75.9]) and change in hippocampus GMD (beta slope= 24.8; 95 % CI: [0.80, 48.8]) were significant predictors of Montreal Cognitive Assessment score change over time. CONCLUSION: Impaired olfaction is associated with degeneration of the cholinergic basal forebrain and bilateral cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus in PD. The relationship between impaired olfaction and cognitive decline may be mediated by greater atrophy of the cortex and hippocampus.

34837250|t|Dysprosody in Isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder with Impaired Olfaction but Intact Nigrostriatal Pathway.
34837250|a|BACKGROUND: Impairments of olfactory and speech function are likely early prodromal symptoms of alpha-synucleinopathy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess whether dysprosody is present in isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) with hyposmia/anosmia and a normal nigrostriatal system. METHODS: Pitch variability during speech was investigated in 17 iRBD subjects with normal olfactory function (iRBD-NOF), 30 iRBD subjects with abnormal olfactory function (iRBD-AOF), and 50 healthy controls. iRBD subjects were evaluated using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and [123I]-2ss-carbomethoxy-3ss-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT). All iRBD subjects completed the 24-month follow-up with DAT-SPECT, speech, and olfactory testing. RESULTS: At baseline, only iRBD-AOF showed monopitch when compared to iRBD-NOF (P = 0.04) and controls (P = 0.03), with no difference between iRBD-NOF and controls (P = 1). At follow-up, dysprosody progressed only in iRBD-AOF with abnormal DAT-SPECT (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Prosody is impaired in hyposmic but not in normosmic iRBD subjects before the nigrostriatal dopaminergic transmission is affected (Braak stage 2).   2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

34874063|t|Dementia screening in rural-dwelling Chinese older adults: The utility of a smell test and the self-rated AD8.
34874063|a|BACKGROUND: Olfactory impairment is associated with dementia in clinical settings. We examined the relationship of olfactory identification function with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) and assessed the discriminative ability of the Sniffin' Sticks Identification Test (SSIT), the self-rated Ascertain Dementia 8-item Questionnaire (AD8), and their combination for dementia detection among rural-dwelling older adults in China. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 4481 participants (age >= 65 years; 56.8% women; 38.1% illiteracy) living in rural communities. The 16-item SSIT was performed to assess olfactory identification function. The self-rated AD8 was administered to participants for cognitive status. We diagnosed dementia, AD, and VaD following the international criteria. Data were analyzed with logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Of the 4481 participants, dementia was diagnosed in 139 persons (3.1%), including 92 with AD and 42 with VaD. The SSIT score (range, 0-16) was associated with multiadjusted odds ratios of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.88) for dementia, 0.84 (0.79-0.90) for AD, and 0.79 (0.71-0.87) for VaD. The area under the curve for the discrimination between participants with and without dementia was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.69-0.77) for SSIT score <= 8 alone, 0.86 (0.82-0.89) for self-rated AD8 score >= 3 alone, and 0.89 (0.86-0.92) for their combination using a logistic model. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory impairment is a clinical marker for all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD. The smell identification test, in combination with the brief self-rated cognitive screening tool, is accurate for screening dementia among rural-dwelling Chinese older adults with no or limited education.

35027385|t|An unusual presentation of thymoma: dysgeusia, ulcerative colitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, autoimmune retinopathy and myasthenia gravis.
35027385|a|A 41-year-old female presented with dysgeusia, dry eyes, nyctalopia with progressive visual field constriction (due to autoimmune retinopathy) and gastrointestinal symptoms (due to ulcerative colitis). She was subsequently admitted to intensive care with a myasthenic crisis, and CT of the thorax demonstrated a thymoma.Following thymectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy, she has remained in complete remission from her ulcerative colitis and myasthenia gravis, her retinopathy has stabilised and there has been no thymoma recurrence over a 10-year postoperative period. There was a brief relapse of her dysgeusia (causing weight loss) and dry eye symptoms 3 years after her surgery, which resolved 8 months later. While the association of thymomas with paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) is well established, it is unusual to present with multiple PNS, and some of these have only been documented in sparse case reports to date. Thymectomy played a crucial role in improvement and stabilisation of her PNS.

35263848|t|The Significance of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder in Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Updated Review.
35263848|a|Background: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a parasomnia, after being diagnosed, can predict the emergence of an alpha-synuclein-associated neurodegenerative disease (NDD) in 20-45% and 92% of patients within 5 and 14 years, respectively. RBD is less common in tauopathies, and the studies to evaluate its association with polyglutamine diseases have been very few. Objective: To revisit our knowledge on the significance of RBD in the emergence of NDDs and to review the recent updates in the potential biomarkers, which can help predict the risk of phenconversion into NDDs in idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients. We also aimed to look at the potential neuroprotective therapies that can potentially be used earlier in iRBD patients. Methods: We conducted a review of the papers, after selecting them from the PubMed database. After a thorough screening, 51 articles were chosen to be included in this review. Results and Conclusion: The prospective studies showed that the risk of phenoconversion of iRBD into overt NDDs increased over the longer duration of follow up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, Electroencephalographic findings along with subtle motor signs, autonomic dysfunction, impaired olfaction, and color vision, among others, can be used to predict the onset of an NDD in iRBD. Phytocannabinoids showed a possible neuroprotective effect in animal studies. Considering how RBD is the antecedent of NDDs, there is a need for additional studies to better understand the utility of the aforementioned biomarkers and institute potential neuroprotective therapies early in the process.

35435041|t|Olfactory stimulation for people with dementia: A rapid review.
35435041|a|There is a growing interest in using olfactory (smell) stimulation in dementia care. This study aims to extend current knowledge by synthesising the evidence on the efficacy of interventions using olfactory stimulation for people with dementia and to assess the effects of different types of odours and administration methods using a mixed methods approach. The rapid review was conducted based on searches in six electronic databases. A narrative approach was applied to assess 20 studies included in the review. Fourteen studies used a quasi-experimental design, five studies used an experimental design and one was a case study. High heterogeneity was found on odours and methods of application used, with the majority of studies administering lavender oil using a diffuser. Mixed results were reported on the benefits of olfactory stimulation on responsive behaviours and cognitive function. Although the evidence available is limited, encouraging results were found regarding olfactory stimulation and increased sleep duration, food intake and improved balance. It was not possible to draw any overall conclusion in relation to the effect of olfactory stimulation. However, this review shows promising results that support further investigation of olfactory stimulation as a nonpharmacological intervention for people with dementia. The review is limited due to the low to moderate quality of studies included. Furthermore, the broad range of approaches was employed, and comparison between the studies was difficult. Further high-quality mixed method studies using robust and detailed protocols are needed to clarify the effects of olfactory stimuli and any other factors that may influence the responses of people with dementia.

35618982|t|Trehalose ameliorates prodromal non-motor deficits and aberrant protein accumulation in a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
35618982|a|Trehalose has been recently revealed as an attractive candidate to prevent and modify Parkinson's disease (PD) progression by regulating autophagy; however, studies have only focused on the reduction of motor symptoms rather than the modulation of disease course from prodromal stage. This study aimed to evaluate whether trehalose has a disease-modifying effect at the prodromal stage before the onset of a motor deficit in 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice exposed to rotenone. We found significant decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and motor dysfunction after 2 weeks rotenone treatment. Mice exposed to rotenone for a week showed an accumulation of protein aggregates in the brain and prodromal non-motor deficits, such as depression and olfactory dysfunction, prior to motor deficits. Trehalose significantly improved olfactory dysfunction and depressive-like behaviors and markedly reduced alpha-synuclein and p62 deposition in the brain. Trehalose further ameliorated motor impairment and loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in rotenone-treated mice. We demonstrated that prodromal non-motor signs in a rotenone-induced PD mouse model are associated with protein aggregate accumulation in the brain and that an autophagy inducer could be valuable to prevent PD progression from prodromal stage by regulating abnormal protein accumulation.

35886975|t|Differential Cellular Balance of Olfactory and Vomeronasal Epithelia in a Transgenic BACHD Rat Model of Huntington's Disease.
35886975|a|Background. For neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), early diagnosis is essential to treat patients and delay symptoms. Impaired olfaction, as observed as an early symptom in Parkinson s disease, may also constitute a key symptom in HD. However, there are few reports on olfactory deficits in HD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate, in a transgenic rat model of HD: (1) whether general olfactory impairment exists and (2) whether there are disease-specific dynamics of olfactory dysfunction when the vomeronasal (VNE) and main olfactory epithelium (MOE) are compared. Methods. We used male rats of transgenic line 22 (TG22) of the bacterial artificial chromosome Huntington disease model (BACHD), aged 3 days or 6 months. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and macrophage activity were examined with immunohistochemistry in the VNE and MOE. Results. No differences were observed in cellular parameters in the VNE between the groups. However, the MOE of the 6-month-old HD animals showed a significantly increased number of mature olfactory receptor neurons. Other cellular parameters were not affected. Conclusions. The results obtained in the TG22 line suggest a relative stability in the VNE, whereas the MOE seems at least temporarily affected.

38335267|t|Multiple Early Biomarkers to Predict Cognitive Decline in Dementia-Free Older Adults.
38335267|a|INTRODUCTION: Baseline olfactory impairment, poor performance on cognitive test, and medial temporal lobe atrophy are considered biomarkers for predicting future cognitive decline in dementia-free older adults. However, the combined effect of these predictors has not been fully investigated. METHODS: A group of 110 participants without dementia were continuously recruited into this study, and underwent olfactory, cognitive tests and MRI scanning at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Olfactory function was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Participants were divided into the cognitive decliners and non-decliners. RESULTS: Among 87 participants who completed the 5-year follow-up, cognitive decline was present in 32 cases and 55 remained stable. Compared with non-decliners, cognitive decliners presented lower scores on both the UPSIT and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and smaller hippocampal volume at baseline (all P < .001). The logistic regression analysis revealed that lower scores on UPSIT and MoCA, and smaller hippocampal volume were strongly associated with subsequent cognitive decline, respectively (all P < .001). For the prediction of cognitive decline, lower score on UPSIT performed the sensitivity of 63.6% and specificity of 81.2%, lower score on MoCA with the sensitivity of 74.5% and specificity of 65.6%, smaller hippocampal volume with the sensitivity of 70.9% and specificity of 78.1%, respectively. Combining three predictors resulted in the sensitivity of 83.6% and specificity of 93.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of olfactory test, cognitive test with structural MRI may enhance the predictive ability for future cognitive decline for dementia-free older adults.

38664714|t|Taste disorders and alopecia in myasthenia gravis.
38664714|a|BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms in myasthenia gravis (MG) are rarely confirmed. Although there are some small cohort studies, a large-systemic survey has not yet been performed. METHODS: We investigated the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with MG who had taste disorders and alopecia using data of 1710 patients with MG enrolled in the Japan MG Registry 2021. RESULTS: Among them, 104 (6.1%) out of 1692 patients and 138 (8.2%) out of 1688 patients had histories of taste disorders and alopecia, respectively. Among the patients with MG, taste disorders were significantly more common in women, those with severe symptoms, refractory MG, or thymoma-associated MG, and were less common in those with ocular MG. The taste disorders often occurred after the onset of MG and often responded to MG treatments. Alopecia was more common in MG patients with a history of bulbar palsy and thymoma, and it often occurred before the onset of MG and sometimes responded to MG treatments. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed taste disturbance was associated with worst quantitative MG score and thymoma-associated MG; and alopecia was associated with thymoma-associated MG. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the non-motor symptoms in MG, especially in patients with severe myasthenic symptoms and thymoma-associated MG.

Its clinical diagnosis depends on the association of pigmented retinitis, polyneuritis and cerebellar syndrome. It is confirmed beyond doubt by the increased C.S.F. protein and phytanemia. A full family history is necessary for it is possible to detect heterozygous carriers of the defect by enzyme studies on fibroblast cultures.

1801759|t|Olfactory identification deficits in HIV infection.
1801759|a|OBJECTIVE: Impaired odor identification is described in a number of CNS disorders, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects the CNS in a large percentage of patients. To evaluate whether impaired olfaction may indicate CNS disease, the authors measured odor identification in patient groups defined along a continuum of progressive immunodeficiency and in a comparison group. METHOD: Most of the 42 HIV-infected patients in the study were outpatients in a clinic specializing in treatment of HIV-infected individuals. The comparison subjects were 37 healthy age- and sex-matched individuals who were recruited from hospital and medical school personnel. Ten of the patients were HIV-seropositive but had no symptoms, 24 had clinical evidence of immunocompromise, and eight had HIV dementia. All subjects were given the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, which presents common odorants and requires the subject to identify the odor from a four-item word list. The data were analyzed by using analysis of variance after arc-sine transformation and Scheffe post hoc analysis. RESULTS: All patients scored significantly lower on the Smell Identification Test than did the comparison subjects. The patients with HIV dementia had significantly lower scores than did the other two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, impaired olfaction might serve as a marker of early CNS HIV involvement. Future studies should attempt to match comparison and experimental populations for socioeconomic status and HIV risk behavior.

1857494|t|Juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus and optic atrophy (Wolfram syndrome)--neurological findings and prognostic implications.
1857494|a|The authors report on one case of Wolfram syndrome, a rare condition, which is characterized by juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy and sensorineural deafness. The findings of this 13-year follow-up show that this patient developed typical neurological complications of long-standing diabetes mellitus as in the common type 1 variant. Moreover, some peculiar signs occurred such as anosmia, ophthalmoplegia interna, and central nystagmus. Since Wolfram syndrome is probably part of a more generalized neurodegenerative disorder, long-term prognosis will depend both upon the severity of chronic diabetic complications and upon the rapidity, by which degeneration of cerebellar, pontine and brain stem structures appear. Prognosis of the cardinal clinical signs is such that optic atrophy, though usually quite rapid in the beginning, generally does not lead to complete blindness. Sensorineural hearing loss progresses very slowly so that deafness might be expected exceptionally only. The hearing deficit in classical diabetics, however, is of retrocochlear origin. Therefore, in Wolfram syndrome, a combined inner-ear and retrocochlear hearing loss may occur.

The female patient of 39 presented all characteristic symptoms of the disease, which had developed progressively starting at the age of 25: atypical retinitis pigmentosa with nightblindness and concentric constriction of the visual fields, cataracts, peripheral polyneuropathy with reduced nerve conduction velocity, ataxia, high protein level in CSF, ichthyosis-like cutaneous manifestations, sceletal anomalies, progressive sensorineural deafness, anosmia. Refsum's disease is a metabolic disorder based on an inborn enzyme defect, inherited by autosomal recessive transmission. It causes storage of phytanic acid in the body. Treatment consists in diet low in phytol and phytanic acid as well as large volume plasma exchanges.

6531052|t|Animal models of infantile amnesia, benign senescent forgetfulness, and senile dementia.
6531052|a|The Jacksonian principle of hierarchical development and dissolution of function was applied to infantile amnesia and memory loss in senescence. When the Jacksonian model is generalized to include life-span changes in memory it predicts a last-in, first-out appearance and disappearance of memory processes. Those memory capacities that are the last to appear in ontogeny should be the first to be compromised in aging. To evaluate this proposition in a specific context, the rodent literature on long-term memory in infant, adult, and aged animals was surveyed. Three types of memorial processes that emerged sequentially in development were identified and then examined in adult and aged rats. Although strong support of the Jacksonian principle did not emerge from this analysis, the data were sufficiently positive to suggest that the theory was still viable and even vigorous enough to guide future research on both the normal and pathological processes of development and aging.

7059836|a|Female rats immunized with mouse nerve growth factor develop an antibody (anti-NGF) which reaches offspring through the placenta and via the milk. Pups exposed to maternal anti-NGF have fewer dorsal root and sympathetic neurons. When the offspring are examined on a wide variety of behavioral tests, they exhibit severe deficits in response to stress (ulceration, corticosterone levels), and mild deficits on some sensory and cognitive tasks. Exploratory and motor functions, however, are relatively normal. The pathologic and behavioral profiles of the animals closely mimic the sensory and sympathetic aspects of familial dysautonomia.

8673478|t|Late-onset hereditary ataxia with global thermoanalgesia and absence of fungiform papillae on the tongue in a Japanese family.
8673478|a|Two Japanese male siblings, aged 68 and 59 years, affected by late-onset progressive ataxia distinguished by extensive sensory and mild autonomic disturbances are described. They had global thermoanalgesia, positive Romberg signs, sensorineural deafness, canal paresis and ageusia. Their autonomic disturbances consisted of absence of overflow tears with usual stimuli, dysphagia, blood pressure and vasomotor instability, diarrhoea/constipation, and urinary frequency. Sensory nerve action potentials were completely absent, whereas motor conduction velocity was slightly reduced only in the lower extremities. Sural nerve biopsy on the younger brother demonstrated a marked loss of myelinated fibres and a reduction in the number of unmyelinated axons. Tongue histology revealed absence of fungiform papillae and taste buds. Autonomic function tests showed widespread but mild sympathetic and parasympathetic failures. Neuro-imaging studies revealed atrophy of the spinal cord, cerebellum, brainstem and corpus callosum, and enlargement of the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. These siblings represent a previously unrecognized variant of late-onset hereditary spinocerebellar degeneration with global thermoanalgesia and absence of fungiform papillae on the tongue.

9339337|t|Sniffing behaviour, or recognizing a lily by smell, but not recognizing a sock on sight.
9339337|a|We report a 65-year-old man with a post-anoxic encephalopathy who showed compulsive sniffing at available objects. This stereotyped environment-driven behaviour has not been previously described. Other compulsive environment-driven responses, such as manipulation and utilization of tools and hyperlexia, were also present. The disorder shared several features with the Kluver-Bucy syndrome where mouthing of objects, rather than smelling them, is common. The patient had a severe dementia, with amnesia, anomia, apraxia, and visual agnosia. Whereas he could not recognize very familiar objects on sight, he could in contrast correctly identify several familiar odours. Although sniffing was a compulsive and purposeless environment-driven behaviour, the question may be asked whether a relatively preserved olfactory recognition, in the presence of a severe disorder of visual recognition and knowledge, could have favoured a stereotyped exploration of objects by smelling.

9527894|t|Olfactory disorder in motor neuron disease.
9527894|a|In Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease there is profound disorder of olfaction. The extent to which this modality is involved in motor neuron disease (MND) has been studied little. To address this further we assessed olfaction by three methods-a smell identification test ("UPSIT") in 58 patients and 135 controls; olfactory-evoked response (OEP) to H2S in 15 patients, and pathological examination of olfactory bulbs obtained from 8 cadavers. It was found that smell identification compared with the controls was slightly worse overall in the MND group as a whole, but only the bulbar patients scored significantly less on the UPSIT. Patients displayed a subtle defect in cheese odor recognition. OEPs were normal in 9 subjects and delayed in 1 subject. The remaining 5 OEPs were unsuccessful. Histopathological studies of olfactory bulbs showed excess lipofuscin deposition in all 8 cases examined, indicating subclinical neuronal damage. Olfactory neurons with a degree of antioxidant defect may be more susceptible to cellular damage than other neuronal groups because of their direct relationship to environmental agents. Overall we found the degree of olfactory dysfunction in MND to be mild and in contrast with the marked changes described by others.

10526195|t|Olfactory loss in multiple sclerosis.
10526195|a|The objectives of the present study were to test odor identification ability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to examine possible correlations between smell identification test scores and various clinical variables. We performed a case-control study comparing the Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test scores of 40 patients with definite multiple sclerosis with those obtained in 40 age-, sex- and smoking-habit-matched healthy controls. The neurological impairment, the disability, the cognitive performances and the psychological functioning were also assessed. Patients with multiple sclerosis scored significantly poorer than controls on the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (P<0.001). Olfactory function was borderline normal in four (10%) and abnormal in five (12.5%) MS patients, whereas it was normal in all controls (P<0.02). Significant correlations between the smell identification score and symptoms of anxiety (r=-0.43, P=0.006), depression (r=-0.42, P=0. 008) and severity of neurological impairment (r=-0.32, P=0.05) were found. Only two (5%) patients with multiple sclerosis reported having episodes of smell loss, suggesting a low level of awareness of this problem. Although smell changes are rarely reported, olfactory function is impaired in a considerable number of patients with MS. The observed association between decreased odor identification ability and symptoms of anxiety and depression in our patients suggests that mood and anxiety disorders have to be considered in assessing olfaction in MS patients. Clearly, smell disturbances deserve greater attention from health professionals and caregivers dealing with such patients.

11312139|t|Hormones and the hippocampus.
11312139|a|Hippocampal lesions produce memory deficits, but the exact function of the hippocampus remains obscure. Evidence is presented that its role in memory may be ancillary to physiological regulation. Molecular studies demonstrate that the hippocampus is a primary target for ligands that reflect body physiology, including ion balance and blood pressure, immunity, pain, reproductive status, satiety and stress. Hippocampal receptors are functional, probably accessible to their ligands, and mediate physiological and cognitive changes. This argues that an early role of the hippocampus may have been in sensing soluble molecules (termed here 'enteroception') in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, perhaps reflecting a common evolutionary origin with the olfactory system ('exteroception'). Functionally, hippocampal enteroception may reflect feedback control; evidence is reviewed that the hippocampus modulates body physiology, including the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, blood pressure, immunity, and reproductive function. It is suggested that the hippocampus operates, in parallel with the amygdala, to modulate body physiology in response to cognitive stimuli. Hippocampal outputs are predominantly inhibitory on downstream neuroendocrine activity; increased synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus (e.g. long-term potentiation) could facilitate throughput inhibition. This may have implications for the role of the hippocampus and long-term potentiation in memory.

12446953|t|Theoretical accounts of Gulf War Syndrome: from environmental toxins to psychoneuroimmunology and neurodegeneration.
12446953|a|Non-specific illness includes a wide variety of symptoms: behavioural (e.g., reduced food and water intake), cognitive (e.g., memory and concentration problems) and physiological (e.g., fever). This paper reviews evidence suggesting that such symptoms can be explained more parsimoniously as a single symptom cluster than as a set of separate illnesses such as Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This superordinate syndrome could have its biological basis in the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines (in particular interleukin-1: IL-1), that give rise to what has become known as the 'sickness response'. It is further argued that the persistence of non-specific illness in chronic conditions like GWS may be (in part) attributable to a bio-associative mechanism (Ferguson and Cassaday, 1999). In the case of GWS, physiological challenges could have produced a non-specific sickness response that became associated with smells (e.g., petrol), coincidentally experienced in the Persian Gulf. On returning to the home environment, these same smells would act as associative triggers for the maintenance of (conditioned) sickness responses. Such associative mechanisms could be mediated through the hypothalamus and limbic system via vagal nerve innervation and would provide an explanation for the persistence of a set of symptoms (e.g., fever) that should normally be short lived and self-limiting. We also present evidence that the pattern of symptoms produced by the pro-inflammatory cytokines reflects a shift in immune system functioning towards a (T-helper-1) Th1 profile. This position contrasts with other immunological accounts of GWS that suggest that the immune system demonstrates a shift to a Th2 (allergy) profile. Evidence pertaining to these two contrasting positions is reviewed.

14635519|t|[Wilson's disease associated with olfactory paranoid syndrome and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura].
14635519|a|In this study we report an individual of Wilson's disease associated with olfactory paranoid syndrome and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The initial symptom of this female patient was olfactory paranoia at age 17. Although that psychiatric symptom was well controlled under pharmacological treatment for two years, she developed olfactory paranoia as well as sialorrhea, dysarthria and finger tremor at age 20. A year later rigidity was also present in the extremities. At age 23, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was found based on hematological examinations. Because her extrapyramidal symptoms were progressive, she was referred to our department to evaluate her neurologic condition. She was diagnosed as having Wilson's disease based on (1) the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, (2) extrapyramidal signs, and (3) a decreased level of serum copper and ceruloplasmin. T2 and FLAIR images of brain MRI showed hyperintense lesions in the putamen, thalamus and pontine tegmentum. Diffusion-weighted images also showed hyperintense lesions in the thalamus and pontine tegmentum. The biopsy specimen of the liver revealed chronic hepatitis with copper accumulation. Since D-penicillamine treatment was initiated, she has shown no olfactory paranoia and exacerbation of ITP. Her gait disturbance has also improved. Olfactory paranoia and ITP are rare clinical complications of Wilson's disease. Further analysis may warrant consideration of the pathophysiological mechanism of the psychiatric, hematological and neuroradiological condition seen in Wilson's disease.

14984801|t|Olfactory deficits in HIV-infected patients with and without AIDS dementia complex.
14984801|a|The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of HIV infection on odour memory. Recognition and identification olfactory tests were administered to six groups of patients defined according to a decrease in cellular immunity: asymptomatic HIV seropositive (HIV+), symptomatic HIV+, HIV+ AIDS, and three groups with a mild, moderate, and severe degree of dementia (AIDS dementia complex [ADC]). Consistent with the literature, the general results show that HIV infection is associated with a decrease in olfactory ability. In addition, a polynomial linear trend analysis indicates a constant decrease in performance from the first to the sixth group of patients, related to the number of CD4 T lymphocytes circulating and to the severity of the pathology. An interesting result regards the drop in performance exhibited by ADC patients on the identification task. Reasonably, such an effect is not attributable to a decline in olfactory ability only, bit rather to a severe semantic memory deficit. It follows that the two tasks used here can be useful clinical supports to discriminate between the mental operations involved in a low cognitive demand task (recognition) and in a high cognitive demand task (identification).

15049515|t|Expression of expanded polyglutamine protein induces behavioral changes in Drosophila (polyglutamine-induced changes in Drosophila).
15049515|a|Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by triplet nucleotide expansion. The expansion of the polyglutamine tract near the C terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3, above a threshold of 40 glutamine repeats causes neuronal loss and degeneration. The expanded ataxin-3 forms aggregates, and nuclear inclusions, within neurons, possibly due to the misfolding of mutant proteins. Here we report upon the behavioral test changes related to truncated and expanded forms of MJD protein (MJDtr) in Drosophila, and show that expanded MJDtr, when expressed in the nervous system, causes characteristic locomotor dysfunction and anosmia. This phenomenon has not been previously reported in humans or in transgenic Drosophila models. In addition, the in vivo expression of the antiapoptotic gene bcl-2 showed no evidence of ameliorating the deleterious effect of MJDtr-Q78s, either in the eye or in the nervous system. The study shows that such Drosophila transgenic models express olfactory dysfunction and ataxic behavior as observed in human patients.

15056457|t|Accelerated extinction of conditioned taste aversion in P301L tau transgenic mice.
15056457|a|Neurofibrillary tangles, insoluble protein deposits composed of filamentous tau aggregates, are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and familial frontotemporal dementia (FTDP-17). Transgenic mice expressing the FTDP-17 mutation P301L of tau recapitulate key features of the human pathology, that is, tau proteins aggregate and neurofibrillary tangles begin to appear in the amygdala at 6 months of age. To detect early signs of tau aggregate-associated changes, we investigated behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits in such mice using an amygdala-specific test battery for anxiety-related and cognitive behavior. P301L mice had anxiety levels not different from wild-types, but their exploratory behavior was significantly increased. Acquisition of a fear response to tone and context as well as taste aversion was comparable to wild-types. However, extinction of a conditioned taste aversion was significantly accelerated. We conclude that already aggregation of tau proteins not yet accompanied by massive formation of neurofibrillary tangles causes selective behavioral deficits.

15314127|t|Smell testing: an additional tool for identification of adult Refsum's disease.
15314127|a|BACKGROUND: Adult Refsum's disease (ARD) is characterised by the presence of retinitis pigmentosa, ataxia, deafness, sensory neuropathy, and bony changes. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of phytanic acidaemia. Although reduced smell function has been described in ARD, its value in the diagnosis of the condition has not been fully evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and degree of olfactory dysfunction in patients with ARD. METHOD: The olfactory function of 16 patients with ARD was assessed using the quantitative University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). RESULTS: All patients had complete anosmia or grossly impaired smell function with a mean UPSIT score of 14.7 (SD 4.7) (normal > 34) despite having been treated with an appropriate diet for a median of 15 years (range 1-25). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of ARD patients can be facilitated by using the UPSIT in combination with the presence of retinitis pigmentosa, even if they have no neurological or bony features. Phytanic acid screening should be performed in any patient manifesting these two signs.

15595933|t|Does L-dopa treatment contribute to reduction in body weight in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease?
15595933|a|OBJECTIVE: Many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) lose weight also early during the disease. The objective of the study was to investigate possible causative factors for this loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this report, 28 PD patients and 28 age- and sex-matched controls were repeatedly assessed with the focus on body weight, body fat mass, dysphagia, olfaction, physical activity, PD symptomatology and drug treatment. RESULTS: Weight loss was seen in PD patients both before and during L-dopa treatment. CONCLUSION: The underlying disease could play a role, but our results also suggest that L-dopa per se could contribute to the weight loss.

16060817|t|Olfactory and auditory event-related potentials in Huntington's disease.
16060817|a|The influence of Huntington's disease (HD) on the olfactory event-related potential (OERP), an electrophysiological measure of olfactory information processing, has not been reported to date. In the present study, olfactory and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded monopolarly from Fz, Cz, and Pz electrode sites in 8 patients with HD and 8 age- and gender-matched control participants. Results demonstrated that individuals with HD were delayed compared with controls on the P3 component of the OERP (p<.001), with a trend toward a significant delay on the auditory ERP P3 (p<.06). The effect size for OERP P3 latency (pi(2)=.72) was larger than that for the auditory P3 (pi(2)=.24), which has previously been shown to be delayed in HD. Patients performed significantly worse than controls did on all neuropsychological measures. These measures significantly correlated with several components of the OERP. These findings extend the understanding of olfactory deficits in HD.

18069020|t|Rigidity in social and emotional memory in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.
18069020|a|Four experiments were conducted to examine social and emotional memory in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease. First, R6/2 mice were tested in a social transmission of food preference task where they had to acquire a preference for a flavoured food (acquisition) and subsequently to learn a preference for a different flavour (shifted reinforcement). R6/2 mice performed well in the acquisition trial. However, they were impaired in the shifted reinforcement trial and perseverated on the first preference learned. Second, mice were trained in an inhibitory avoidance paradigm, with either one or two footshocks delivered during the training. WT mice given one footshock showed retention levels lower than those of mice trained with two footshocks. By contrast, there was no difference in retention levels of R6/2 mice given either one or two footshocks. Third, mice were tested in an active avoidance task that paired a mild footshock with a warning light. R6/2 mice had a strong age-dependent deficit in this task. Finally, mice were tested in a conditioned taste aversion task that paired a saccharine solution with a nausea-inducing agent (LiCl). R6/2 mice displayed normal aversion, however this was not extinguished following repeated exposure to saccharine solution alone. Our data show that while R6/2 mice have functional hippocampus-based memory, they have deficits in striatum-based memory skills. Further, social and emotional memories appear to be encoded in a rigid way that is not influenced by subsequent learning or by arousal levels.

18792015|t|Curcumin and the cellular stress response in free radical-related diseases.
18792015|a|Free radicals play a main pathogenic role in several human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and cancer. Although there has been progress in treatment of these diseases, the development of important side effects may complicate the therapeutic course. Curcumin, a well known spice commonly used in India to make foods colored and flavored, is also used in traditional medicine to treat mild or moderate human diseases. In the recent years, a growing body of literature has unraveled the antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antinfectious activity of curcumin based on the ability of this compound to regulate a number of cellular signal transduction pathways. These promising data obtained in vitro are now being translated to the clinic and more than ten clinical trials are currently ongoing worldwide. This review outlines the biological activities of curcumin and discusses its potential use in the prevention and treatment of human diseases.

18814199|t|Smell test predicts performance on delayed recall memory test in elderly with depression.
18814199|a|INTRODUCTION: Elderly with depression are at increased risk for cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Smell tests are correlated with performance on cognitive tests in the elderly and therefore might serve as a screening test for cognitive impairment in depressed elderly. PURPOSE: To assess the validity of the CC-SIT (Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test) as a screening test for cognitive impairment in elderly with depression. METHODS: Forty-one patients, aged 60 and over, were assessed with the CC-SIT and CVLT (California Verbal Learning Test) after 3 months treatment of a Major Depressive Episode (DSM-IV) at the Day Hospital for Depression, Baycrest. Patients already diagnosed with dementia, or other psychiatric and neurological disorders, were excluded. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied to assess the CC-SIT's accuracy in identifying individuals with impairment (2 SD below the mean for age and education or less) on CVLT delayed recall trials. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (33 women and eight men) were assessed. Mean age was 76.8 (SD: 6.5), mean HRSD scores before treatment was 22.0 (SD: 5.1). Nine patients had impairment on CVLT delayed recall measures. The area under the ROC curve was 0.776 (95% CI = 0.617-0.936). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of the CC-SIT as a screening tool for cognitive impairment among elderly with depression as an indicator for the need of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Replication with larger samples is necessary.

19728279|t|[Sense of smell, physiological ageing and neurodegenerative diseases: I. Anatomy and clinical examination].
19728279|a|INTRODUCTION: Different studies on normal and pathological ageing have shown structural and functional impairment by means of psychophysical measures, electrophysiological studies and brain imaging studies. Lower sensory perception from peripheral olfactory structures, together with alterations in the medulla oblongata and cortex, are the most frequent causes of olfactory impairment in ageing. AIM: To outline the most important tests that can be applied in clinical evaluation. DEVELOPMENT: The article begins by reviewing concepts involved in olfactory anatomy and physiology and then goes on to describe the different methods of examination and their applicability to medical diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating olfactory tests into clinical practice makes it possible to study the presence of sensory and cognitive impairment in greater depth, especially in ageing and in neurodegenerative diseases; this will allow a possible diagnosis to be expanded and completed.

20351282|t|PI3 kinase signaling is involved in Abeta-induced memory loss in Drosophila.
20351282|a|Multiple intracellular signals are altered in Alzheimer's disease brain tissues, including the PI3K/Akt pathway. However, the pathological relevance of such alterations is poorly understood. In vitro studies yield results that seem to be consistent with the conventional perception in which an up-regulation of the cell survival pathway, PI3K pathway, is protective in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The current in vivo genetic approach, however, reveals that inhibition of the PI3K pathway leads to rescuing of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)-induced memory loss in the Drosophila brain. We began our inquiry into the molecular basis of this memory loss by studying Abeta42-induced enhancement of long-term depression. We found that long-term depression is restored to a normal level through inhibition of PI3K activity. Abeta42-induced PI3K hyperactivity is directly confirmed by immunostaining of the PI3K phosphorylation targets, phospholipids. Such observations lead to the following demonstration that Abeta42-induced memory loss can be rescued through genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of PI3K functions. Our data suggest that Abeta42 stimulates PI3K, which in turn causes memory loss in association with an increase in accumulation of Abeta42 aggregates.

20668197|t|A distinct set of Drosophila brain neurons required for neurofibromatosis type 1-dependent learning and memory.
20668197|a|Nonspecific cognitive impairments are one of the many manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A learning phenotype is also present in Drosophila melanogaster that lack a functional neurofibromin gene (nf1). Multiple studies have indicated that Nf1-dependent learning in Drosophila involves the cAMP pathway, including the demonstration of a genetic interaction between Nf1 and the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase (Rut-AC). Olfactory classical conditioning experiments have previously demonstrated a requirement for Rut-AC activity and downstream cAMP pathway signaling in neurons of the mushroom bodies. However, Nf1 expression in adult mushroom body neurons has not been observed. Here, we address this discrepancy by demonstrating (1) that Rut-AC is required for the acquisition and stability of olfactory memories, whereas Nf1 is only required for acquisition, (2) that expression of nf1 RNA can be detected in the cell bodies of mushroom body neurons, and (3) that expression of an nf1 transgene only in the alpha/beta subset of mushroom body neurons is sufficient to restore both protein synthesis-independent and protein synthesis-dependent memory. Our observations indicate that memory-related functions of Rut-AC are both Nf1-dependent and -independent, that Nf1 mediates the formation of two distinct memory components within a single neuron population, and that our understanding of Nf1 function in memory processes may be dissected from its role in other brain functions by specifically studying the alpha/beta mushroom body neurons.

21187979|t|Olfactory stem cells, a new cellular model for studying molecular mechanisms underlying familial dysautonomia.
21187979|a|BACKGROUND: Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a hereditary neuropathy caused by mutations in the IKBKAP gene, the most common of which results in variable tissue-specific mRNA splicing with skipping of exon 20. Defective splicing is especially severe in nervous tissue, leading to incomplete development and progressive degeneration of sensory and autonomic neurons. The specificity of neuron loss in FD is poorly understood due to the lack of an appropriate model system. To better understand and modelize the molecular mechanisms of IKBKAP mRNA splicing, we collected human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (hOE-MSC) from FD patients. hOE-MSCs have a pluripotent ability to differentiate into various cell lineages, including neurons and glial cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We confirmed IKBKAP mRNA alternative splicing in FD hOE-MSCs and identified 2 novel spliced isoforms also present in control cells. We observed a significant lower expression of both IKBKAP transcript and IKAP/hELP1 protein in FD cells resulting from the degradation of the transcript isoform skipping exon 20. We localized IKAP/hELP1 in different cell compartments, including the nucleus, which supports multiple roles for that protein. We also investigated cellular pathways altered in FD, at the genome-wide level, and confirmed that cell migration and cytoskeleton reorganization were among the processes altered in FD. Indeed, FD hOE-MSCs exhibit impaired migration compared to control cells. Moreover, we showed that kinetin improved exon 20 inclusion and restores a normal level of IKAP/hELP1 in FD hOE-MSCs. Furthermore, we were able to modify the IKBKAP splicing ratio in FD hOE-MSCs, increasing or reducing the WT (exon 20 inclusion):MU (exon 20 skipping) ratio respectively, either by producing free-floating spheres, or by inducing cells into neural differentiation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: hOE-MSCs isolated from FD patients represent a new approach for modeling FD to better understand genetic expression and possible therapeutic approaches. This model could also be applied to other neurological genetic diseases.

21970782|a|Bilateral internal auditory canal (IAC) tumours are almost exclusively associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, and there is very little, if anything, that can mimic this appearance. We present a very rare case of a 75-year-old gentleman who initially presented with bilateral IAC tumours and later diagnosed as an isolated primary CNS myeloma without systemic involvement. This is a very rare presentation and has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. He was treated with a combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The treatment was well tolerated but with limited response. Although rare, metastasis should be considered as a differential diagnosis of IAC lesions.

22056384|t|Inflammation-induced subventricular zone dysfunction leads to olfactory deficits in a targeted mouse model of multiple sclerosis.
22056384|a|Neural stem cells (NSCs) persist in defined brain niches, including the subventricular zone (SVZ), throughout adulthood and generate new neurons destined to support specific neurological functions. Whether brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with changes in adult NSCs and whether this might contribute to the development and/or persistence of neurological deficits remains poorly investigated. We examined SVZ function in mice in which we targeted an MS-like pathology to the forebrain. In these mice, which we refer to herein as targeted EAE (tEAE) mice, there was a reduction in the number of neuroblasts compared with control mice. Altered expression of the transcription factors Olig2 and Dlx2 in the tEAE SVZ niche was associated with amplification of pro-oligodendrogenic transit-amplifying cells and decreased neuroblast generation, which resulted in persistent reduction in olfactory bulb neurogenesis. Altered SVZ neurogenesis led to impaired long-term olfactory memory, mimicking the olfactory dysfunction observed in MS patients. Importantly, we also found that neurogenesis was reduced in the SVZ of MS patients compared with controls. Thus, our findings suggest that neuroinflammation induces functional alteration of adult NSCs that may contribute to olfactory dysfunction in MS patients.

23082113|t|Profound olfactory dysfunction in myasthenia gravis.
23082113|a|In this study we demonstrate that myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease strongly identified with deficient acetylcholine receptor transmission at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, is accompanied by a profound loss of olfactory function. Twenty-seven MG patients, 27 matched healthy controls, and 11 patients with polymiositis, a disease with peripheral neuromuscular symptoms analogous to myasthenia gravis with no known central nervous system involvement, were tested. All were administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the Picture Identification Test (PIT), a test analogous in content and form to the UPSIT designed to control for non-olfactory cognitive confounds. The UPSIT scores of the myasthenia gravis patients were markedly lower than those of the age- and sex-matched normal controls [respective means (SDs) =20.15 (6.40) & 35.67 (4.95); p<0.0001], as well as those of the polymiositis patients who scored slightly below the normal range [33.30 (1.42); p<0.0001]. The latter finding, along with direct monitoring of the inhalation of the patients during testing, implies that the MG-related olfactory deficit is unlikely due to difficulties sniffing, per se. All PIT scores were within or near the normal range, although subtle deficits were apparent in both the MG and PM patients, conceivably reflecting influences of mild cognitive impairment. No relationships between performance on the UPSIT and thymectomy, time since diagnosis, type of treatment regimen, or the presence or absence of serum anti-nicotinic or muscarinic antibodies were apparent. Our findings suggest that MG influences olfactory function to the same degree as observed in a number of neurodegenerative diseases in which central nervous system cholinergic dysfunction has been documented.

23175856|t|Overlooked non-motor symptoms in myasthenia gravis.
23175856|a|Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) may have various non-motor symptoms in addition to fatigability and weakness of skeletal muscles. Thymomas contain abundant immature thymocytes and developing CD4 and CD8 T cells. Thymomas are found in 15-25% of patients with MG and are associated with severe symptoms. We suggest that non-motor symptoms are based on the autoimmune disorders probably owing to an abnormal T cell repertoire from thymomas. Using previously reported cases and cases from our multicentre cooperative study, we review the clinical characteristics of patients with thymoma-associated MG who have non-motor symptoms. CD8 T cell cytotoxicity against haematopoietic precursor cells in bone marrow and unidentified autoantigens in hair follicles lead to the development of pure red cell aplasia, immunodeficiency and alopecia areata. In contrast, neuromyotonia, limbic encephalitis, myocarditis and taste disorders are autoantibody-mediated disorders, as is MG. Autoantibodies to several types of voltage-gated potassium channels and the related molecules can evoke various neurological and cardiac disorders. About 25% of patients with thymoma-associated MG have at least one non-motor symptom. Non-motor symptoms affect many target organs and result in a broad spectrum of disease, ranging from the impairment of quality of life to lethal conditions. Since relatively little attention is paid to non-motor symptoms in patients with thymoma-associated MG, the symptoms may be overlooked by many physicians. Early diagnosis is important, since non-motor symptoms can be treatable. A complete understanding of non-motor symptoms is necessary for the management of patients with thymoma-associated MG.

23691255|t|Intact olfaction in a mouse model of multiple system atrophy.
23691255|a|BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that olfaction is largely preserved in multiple system atrophy while most patients with Parkinson's disease are hyposmic. Consistent with these observations, recent experimental studies demonstrated olfactory deficits in transgenic Parkinson's disease mouse models, but corresponding data are lacking for MSA models. METHODS: Olfactory function and underlying neuropathological changes were investigated in a transgenic multiple system atrophy mouse model based on targeted oligodendroglial overexpression of alpha-synuclein as well as wild-type controls. The study was divided into (1) a pilot study investigating olfactory preference testing and (2) a long-term study characterizing changes in the olfactory bulb of aging transgenic multiple system atrophy mice. RESULTS: In our pilot behavioral study, we observed no significant differences in investigation time in the olfactory preference test comparing transgenic with wild-type animals. These findings were accompanied by unaffected tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell numbers in the olfactory bulb. Similarly, although a significant age-related increase in the amount of alpha-synuclein within the olfactory bulb was detected in the long-term study, progressive degeneration of the olfactory bulb could not be verified. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental data show preserved olfaction in a transgenic multiple system atrophy mouse model despite alpha-synucleinopathy in the olfactory bulb. These findings are in line with the human disorder supporting the concept of a primary oligodendrogliopathy with variable neuronal involvement.

24009736|t|Impaired sense of smell in a Drosophila Parkinson's model.
24009736|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the clinical triad: tremor, akinesia and rigidity. Several studies have suggested that PD patients show disturbances in olfaction at the earliest onset of the disease. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is becoming a powerful model organism to study neurodegenerative diseases. We sought to use this system to explore olfactory dysfunction, if any, in PINK1 mutants, which is a model for PD. PINK1 mutants display many important diagnostic symptoms of the disease such as akinetic motor behavior. In the present study, we describe for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical results concerning the olfactory function in PINK1 mutant flies. Electroantennograms were recorded in response to synthetic and natural volatiles (essential oils) from groups of PINK1 mutant adults at three different time points in their life cycle: one from 3-5 day-old flies, from 15-20 and from 27-30 days. The results obtained were compared with the same age-groups of wild type flies. We found that mutant adults showed a decrease in the olfactory response to 1-hexanol, alpha-pinene and essential oil volatiles. This olfactory response in mutant adults decreased even more as the flies aged. Immunohistological analysis of the antennal lobes in these mutants revealed structural abnormalities, especially in the expression of Bruchpilot protein, a marker for synaptic active zones. The combination of electrophysiological and morphological results suggests that the altered synaptic organization may be due to a neurodegenerative process. Our results indicate that this model can be used as a tool for understanding PD pathogensis and pathophysiology. These results help to explore the potential of using olfaction as a means of monitoring PD progression and developing new treatments.

24179289|t|Antidepressants and REM sleep behavior disorder: isolated side effect or neurodegenerative signal?
24179289|a|OBJECTIVES: Antidepressants, among the most commonly prescribed medications, trigger symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in up to 6% of users. Idiopathic RBD is a very strong prodromal marker of Parkinson disease and other synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative syndromes. It is therefore critically important to understand whether antidepressant-associated RBD is an independent pharmacologic syndrome or a sign of possible prodromal neurodegeneration. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary sleep disorders center. PARTICIPANTS: 100 patients with idiopathic RBD, all with diagnosis confirmed on polysomnography, stratified to baseline antidepressant use, with 45 matched controls. MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS: Of 100 patients, 27 were taking antidepressants. Compared to matched controls, RBD patients taking antidepressants demonstrated significant abnormalities of 12/14 neurodegenerative markers tested, including olfaction (P = 0.007), color vision (P = 0.004), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale II and III (P < 0.001 and 0.007), timed up-and-go (P = 0.003), alternate tap test (P = 0.002), Purdue Pegboard (P = 0.007), systolic blood pressure drop (P = 0.029), erectile dysfunction (P = 0.002), constipation (P = 0.003), depression indices (P < 0.001), and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (13% vs. 60%, P < 0.001). All these abnormalities were indistinguishable in severity from RBD patients not taking antidepressants. However, on prospective follow-up, RBD patients taking antidepressants had a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative disease than those without antidepressant use (5-year risk = 22% vs. 59%, RR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with antidepressant-associated RBD have a lower risk of neurodegeneration than patients with "purely-idiopathic" RBD, markers of prodromal neurodegeneration are still clearly present. Development of RBD with antidepressants can be an early signal of an underlying neurodegenerative disease.

24278347|t|A broad phenotypic screen identifies novel phenotypes driven by a single mutant allele in Huntington's disease CAG knock-in mice.
24278347|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene encoding huntingtin. The disease has an insidious course, typically progressing over 10-15 years until death. Currently there is no effective disease-modifying therapy. To better understand the HD pathogenic process we have developed genetic HTT CAG knock-in mouse models that accurately recapitulate the HD mutation in man. Here, we describe results of a broad, standardized phenotypic screen in 10-46 week old heterozygous HdhQ111 knock-in mice, probing a wide range of physiological systems. The results of this screen revealed a number of behavioral abnormalities in HdhQ111/+ mice that include hypoactivity, decreased anxiety, motor learning and coordination deficits, and impaired olfactory discrimination. The screen also provided evidence supporting subtle cardiovascular, lung, and plasma metabolite alterations. Importantly, our results reveal that a single mutant HTT allele in the mouse is sufficient to elicit multiple phenotypic abnormalities, consistent with a dominant disease process in patients. These data provide a starting point for further investigation of several organ systems in HD, for the dissection of underlying pathogenic mechanisms and for the identification of reliable phenotypic endpoints for therapeutic testing.

24286859|t|Neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects of a multi-targeted food intervention in an animal model of neurodegeneration and depression.
24286859|a|Rising neurodegenerative and depressive disease prevalence combined with the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatments and dangerous side effects, has created an urgent need for the development of effective therapies. Considering that these disorders are multifactorial in origin, treatments designed to interfere at different mechanistic levels may be more effective than the traditional single-targeted pharmacological concepts. To that end, an experimental diet composed of zinc, melatonin, curcumin, piperine, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n-3), uridine, and choline was formulated. This diet was tested on the olfactory bulbectomized rat (OBX), an established animal model of depression and cognitive decline. The ingredients of the diet have been individually shown to attenuate glutamate excitoxicity, exert potent anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory properties, and improve synaptogenesis; processes that all have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and in the cognitive deficits following OBX in rodents. Dietary treatment started 2 weeks before OBX surgery, continuing for 6 weeks in total. The diet attenuated OBX-induced cognitive and behavioral deficits, except long-term spatial memory. Ameliorating effects of the diet extended to the control animals. Furthermore, the experimental diet reduced hippocampal atrophy and decreased the peripheral immune activation in the OBX rats. The ameliorating effects of the diet on the OBX-induced changes were comparable to those of the NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine, a drug used for the management of Alzheimer's disease. This proof-of-concept study suggests that a diet, which simultaneously targets multiple disease etiologies, can prevent/impede the development of a neurodegenerative and depressive disorders and the concomitant cognitive deficits.

24725416|t|Sweet taste loss in myasthenia gravis: more than a coincidence?
24725416|a|Sweet dysgeusia, a rare taste disorder, may be encountered in severe anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChRAb)-myasthenia gravis (MG). A 42 year-old man reported progressive loss of sweet taste evolving for almost 10 weeks, revealing an AChRAb-positive MG with thymoma. Improvement of sweet perception paralleled reduction of the MG composite score during the 15 months follow up period, with immunosuppressive and surgical treatments. We suggest that sweet dysgeusia is a non-motor manifestation of MG that may result from a thymoma-dependent autoimmune mechanism targeting gustducin-positive G-protein-coupled taste receptor cells, in line with recent data from MRL/MpJ-Fas lpr/ (MRL/lpr) transgenic mice with autoimmune disease.

25313987|t|Prognostic significance of weight changes in Parkinson's disease: the Park-weight phenotype.
25313987|a|Neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a changing profile of weight as the disease advances. Whilst some patients gain weight, a significant proportion of patients lose weight. PD patients have a lower body weight as compared with non-PD controls. Weight loss is not a benign phenomenon. Patients with lower initial body weight and weight losers have a higher risk of developing dyskinesia. There is a relationship between body weight and levodopa dose, patients with higher levodopa dose per kilogram are at a higher risk of dyskinesia, the risk escalates above 6 mg per kilogram. Lower weight patients have risk of undernutrition and the associated disease pathology due to frailty. Weight losers are at risk of higher mortality and poor quality of life. PD patients should be assessed for body weight and the dose of levodopa be adjusted according to periodic weight changes, supplemented by other dopaminergic medications. Patients at risk of weight loss may be identified by their severe loss of olfaction since there seems to exist the olfaction-weight-dyskinesia phenotype. Measures should be taken to prevent weight loss in at-risk patients to prevent low-weight-related adverse outcomes in PD patients. These measures may protect PD patients from motor and non-motor adverse effects as the disease advances.

25497594|t|Role of IP3 receptor signaling in cell functions and diseases.
25497594|a|IP3 receptor (IP3R) was found to release Ca(2+) from non-mitochondrial store but the exact localization and the mode of action of IP3 remained a mystery. IP3R was identified to be P400 protein, a protein, which was missing in the cerebellum of ataxic mutant mice lacking Ca(2+) spikes in Pukinje cells. IP3R was an IP3 binding protein and was a Ca(2+) channel localized on the endoplasmic reticulum. Full-length cDNA of IP3R type 1 was initially cloned and later two other isoforms of IP3R (IP3R type 2 and type 3) were cloned in vertebrates. Interestingly, the phosphorylation sites, splicing sites, associated molecules, IP3 binding affinity and 5' promoter sequences of each isoform were different. Thus each isoform of IP3 receptor plays a role as a signaling hub offering a unique platform for matching various functional molecules that determines different trajectories of cell signaling. Because of this distinct role of each isoform of IP3R, the dysregulation of IP3 receptor causes various kinds of diseases in human and rodents such as ataxia, vulnerability to neuronal degeneration, heart disease, exocrine secretion deficit, taste perception deficit. Moreover, IP3 was found not only to release Ca(2+), but also to release IRBIT (IP3receptor binding protein released with inositol trisphosphate) essential for the regulation of acid-base balance, RNA synthesis and ribonucleotide reductase.

26025012|t|Selective cognitive and psychiatric manifestations in Wolfram Syndrome.
26025012|a|BACKGROUND: Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is known to involve diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, vision loss, hearing impairment, motor abnormalities, and neurodegeneration, but has been less clearly linked to cognitive, sleep, and psychiatric abnormalities. We sought to determine whether these abnormalities are present in children, adolescents, and young adults with WFS compared to age- and gender-matched individuals with and without type 1 diabetes using standardized measures. METHODS: Individuals with genetically-confirmed WFS (n = 19, ages 7-27) were compared to age- and gender- equivalent groups of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; n = 25), and non-diabetic healthy controls (HC: n = 25). Cognitive performance across multiple domains (verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, memory, attention, smell identification) was assessed using standardized tests. Standardized self- and parent-report questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances were acquired from all groups and an unstructured psychiatric interview was performed within only the WFS group. RESULTS: The three groups were similar demographically (age, gender, ethnicity, parental IQ). WFS and T1DM had similar duration of diabetes but T1DM had higher HbA1C levels than WFS and as expected both groups had higher levels than HC. The WFS group was impaired on smell identification and reported sleep quality, but was not impaired in any other cognitive or self-reported psychiatric domain. In fact, the WFS group performed better than the other two groups on selected memory and attention tasks. However, based upon a clinical evaluation of only WFS patients, we found that psychiatric and behavioral problems were present and consisted primarily of anxiety and hypersomnolence. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that cognitive performance and psychological health were relatively preserved WFS patients, while smell and sleep abnormalities manifested in many of the WFS patients. These findings contradict past case and retrospective reports indicating significant cognitive and psychiatric impairment in WFS. While many of these patients were diagnosed with anxiety and hypersomnolence, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms indicated that the symptoms were not of grave concern to the patients. It may be that cognitive and psychiatric issues become more prominent later in life and/or in later stages of the disease, but this requires standardized assessment and larger samples to determine. In the relatively early stages of WFS, smell and sleep-related symptoms may be useful biomarkers of disease and should be monitored longitudinally to determine if they are good markers of progression as well.

26081353|t|[Evaluations of olfactory function for myasthenia gravis patients].
26081353|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the olfactory function of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and analyze the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and clinical characteristics. METHODS: A total of 61 MG patients from March to July 2014 and 32 healthy controls (HC) received T&T olfactometer test. Their clinical data were collected. And the relationship of T&T score and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The identification threshold of T&T olfactometer test was (2.07+-1.56) versus (0.31+-1.25) for healthy controls. MG patients had a worse performance on olfaction test than healthy controls (t=5.50, P<0.01). By Spearman's analysis, disease course (r=0.348, P=0.006), QMG scores (r=0.393, P=0.025), ADL scores (r=0.421, P=0.01) and dosing time of pyridostigmine (r=0.295, P=0.025) were positively correlated with T&T scores. However, the dosing times of prednisone (r=0.084, P=0.053) or immunodepressants (r=0.153, P=0.251) were not correlated with T&T scores. CONCLUSION: MG patients have poor olfactory sensation.And a potential involvement of non-motor system shall attract the attention of neurologists.

26111003|t|The loss of scents: do defects in olfactory sensory neuron development underlie human disease?
26111003|a|The olfactory system is a fascinating and beguiling sensory system: olfactory sensory neurons detect odors underlying behaviors essential for mate choice, food selection, and escape from predators, among others. These sensory neurons are unique in that they have dendrites contacting the outside world, yet their first synapse lies in the central nervous system. The information entering the central nervous system is used to create odor memories that play a profound role in recognition of individuals, places, and appropriate foods. Here, the structure of the olfactory epithelium is given as an overview to discuss the origin of the olfactory placode, the plasticity of the olfactory sensory neurons, and finally the origins of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuroendocrine cells. For the purposes of this review, the development of the peripheral sensory system will be analyzed, incorporating recently published studies highlighting the potential novelties in development mechanisms. Specifically, an emerging model where the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb develop simultaneously from a continuous neurectoderm patterned at the end of gastrulation, and the multiple origins of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuroendocrine cells associated with the olfactory sensory system development will be presented. Advances in the understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying olfactory sensory system development allows for a more thorough understanding of the potential causes of human disease.

26200050|t|Neurodegenerative changes in the brainstem and olfactory bulb in people older than 50 years old: a descriptive study.
26200050|a|With the increase in life expectancy in Brazil, concerns have grown about the most prevalent diseases in elderly people. Among these diseases are neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Protein deposits related to the development of these diseases can pre-date the symptomatic phases by years. The tau protein is particularly interesting: it might be found in the brainstem and olfactory bulb long before it reaches the limbic cortex, at which point symptoms occur. Of the 14 brains collected in this study, the tau protein was found in the brainstems of 10 (71.42%) and in olfactory bulbs of 3 out 11. Of the 7 individuals who had a final diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 6 presented tau deposits in some region of the brainstem. Our data support the idea of the presence of tau protein in the brainstem and olfactory bulb in the earliest stages of AD.

26205974|t|Detecting dementia in patients with normal neuropsychological screening by Short Smell Test and Palmo-Mental Reflex Test: an observational study.
26205974|a|BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) are in best position to suspect dementia. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) are widely used. Additional neurological tests may increase the accuracy of diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate diagnostic ability to detect dementia with a Short Smell Test (SST) and Palmo-Mental Reflex (PMR) in patients whose MMSE and CDT are normal, but who show signs of cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: This was a 3.5-year cross-sectional observational study in the Memory Clinic of the University Department of Geriatrics in Bern, Switzerland. Participating patients with normal MMSE (>26 points) and CDT (>5 points) were referred by GPs because they suspected dementia. All were examined according to a standardized protocol. Diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-IV TR criteria. We used SST and PMR to determine if they accurately detected dementia. RESULTS: In our cohort, 154 patients suspected of dementia had normal MMSE and CDT test results. Of these, 17 (11%) were demented. If SST or PMR were abnormal, sensitivity was 71% (95% CI 44-90%), and specificity 64% (95% CI 55-72%) for detecting dementia. If both tests were abnormal, sensitivity was 24% (95% CI 7-50%), but specificity increased to 93% (95% CI 88-97%). CONCLUSION: Patients suspected of dementia, but with normal MMSE and CDT results, may benefit if SST and PMR are added as diagnostic tools. If both SST and PMR are abnormal, this is a red flag to investigate these patients further, even though their negative neuropsychological screening results.

26411940|t|[Oxidative Stress Derived from Airborne Fine and Ultrafine Particles and the Effects on Brain-Nervous System: Part 2].
26411940|a|Traffic-related air pollution is a major contributor to urban air pollution. Diesel exhaust (DE) is its most important component of near-road and urban air pollutions and is commonly used as a surrogate model of air pollution in health effects studies. In particular, diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) and nanoparticles in DEPs are the components considered hazardous for health. It is widely known that exposure to DEPs is associated with mortality caused by respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, evidence has been accumulating showing that DEPs and nanoparticles may cause neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we introduce evidence suggesting their association with these disorders. The chemical components and the translocation of DEPs and nanoparticles to the brain are described in part 1. In part 2, we introduce the mechanism of development of neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease via oxidative stress and inflammatory events. Furthermore, there are many lines of epidemiological evidence showing that the particulates impair cognitive function and ability of memory through oxidative and inflammatory events in the brain. These lines of evidences are supported by many animal experiments on neurological disorders.

26783111|t|Increased Olfactory Bulb BDNF Expression Does Not Rescue Deficits in Olfactory Neurogenesis in the Huntington's Disease R6/2 Mouse.
26783111|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene. Mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt) interferes with the actions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and BDNF signaling is reduced in the diseased striatum. Loss of this trophic support is thought to contribute to loss of striatal medium spiny neurons in HD. Increasing BDNF in the adult striatum or ventricular ependyma slows disease progression in HD mouse models, and diverts subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived neuroblasts from their normal destination, the olfactory bulb, to the striatum, where some survive and develop features of mature neurons. Most neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb differentiate as granule cells, with approximately half surviving whereas others undergo apoptosis. In the R6/2 HD mouse model, survival of adult-born granule cells is reduced. Newly maturing cells express the BDNF receptor TrkB, suggesting that mhtt may interfere with normal BDNF trophic activity, increasing their loss. To determine if augmenting BDNF counteracts this, we examined granule cell survival in R6/2 mice that overexpress BDNF in olfactory bulb. Although we detected a decline in apoptosis, increased BDNF was not sufficient to normalize granule cell survival within their normal target in R6/2 mice.

26852411|t|Succinobucol, a Non-Statin Hypocholesterolemic Drug, Prevents Premotor Symptoms and Nigrostriatal Neurodegeneration in an Experimental Model of Parkinson's Disease.
26852411|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by non-motor and motor disabilities. This study investigated whether succinobucol (SUC) could mitigate nigrostriatal injury caused by intranasal 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration in mice. Moreover, the effects of SUC against MPTP-induced behavioral impairments and neurochemical changes were also evaluated. The quantification of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) cells was also performed in primary mesencephalic cultures to evaluate the effects of SUC against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity in vitro. C57BL/6 mice were treated with SUC (10 mg/kg/day, intragastric (i.g.)) for 30 days, and thereafter, animals received MPTP infusion (1 mg/nostril) and SUC treatment continued for additional 15 days. MPTP-infused animals displayed significant non-motor symptoms including olfactory and short-term memory deficits evaluated in the olfactory discrimination, social recognition, and water maze tasks. These behavioral impairments were accompanied by inhibition of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity (complex I), as well as significant decrease of TH and dopamine transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum. Although SUC treatment did not rescue NADH dehydrogenase activity inhibition, it was able to blunt MPTP-induced behavioral impairments and prevented the decrease in TH and DAT immunoreactivities in substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. SUC also suppressed striatal astroglial activation and increased interleukin-6 levels in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Furthermore, SUC significantly prevented the loss of TH+ neurons induced by MPP+ in primary mesencephalic cultures. These results provide new evidence that SUC treatment counteracts early non-motor symptoms and neurodegeneration/neuroinflammation in the nigrostriatal pathway induced by intranasal MPTP administration in mice by modulating events downstream to the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase inhibition.

27430424|t|Olfactory Function and Associated Clinical Correlates in Former National Football League Players.
27430424|a|Professional American football players incur thousands of repetitive head impacts (RHIs) throughout their lifetime. The long-term consequences of RHI are not well characterized, but may include olfactory dysfunction. RHI has been associated with changes to brain regions involved in olfaction, and olfactory impairment is common after traumatic brain injury. Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent early sequelae of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), and RHI is associated with the neurodegenerative disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We examined olfaction, and its association with clinical measures, in former National Football League (NFL) players. Ninety-five former NFL players (ages 40-69) and 28 same-age controls completed a neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric evaluation as part of a National Institutes of Health-funded study. The Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) assessed olfaction. Principal component analysis generated a four-factor structure of the clinical measures: behavioral/mood, psychomotor speed/executive function, and verbal and visual memory. Former NFL players had worse B-SIT scores relative to controls (p = 0.0096). A B-SIT cutoff of 11 had the greatest accuracy (c-statistic = 0.61) and specificity (79%) for discriminating former NFL players from controls. In the former NFL players, lower B-SIT scores correlated with greater behavioral/mood impairment (p = 0.0254) and worse psychomotor speed/executive functioning (p = 0.0464) after controlling for age and education. Former NFL players exhibited lower olfactory test scores relative to controls, and poorer olfactory test performance was associated with worse neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric functioning. Future work that uses more-comprehensive tests of olfaction and structural and functioning neuroimaging may improve understanding on the association between RHI and olfaction.

27697846|t|Mementos from Boots multisensory boxes - Qualitative evaluation of an intervention for people with dementia: Innovative practice.
27697846|a|This qualitative study explored a multisensory (including olfactory) intervention for people with dementia. Six themed boxes (e.g. Childhood) containing items chosen from the Boots archive designed to encourage conversation were used in weekly group sessions. Session participants were people with dementia and care staff from a local care home, a trained facilitator and archivists from Boots UK. Semi-structured interviews explored participants' experiences of the sessions. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The three major themes Engagement (subthemes: Inclusiveness; Emotional involvement; Factors that supported engagement), What's in the box (subthemes: Contents stimulate memories; Mystery, variety and age of items; Value of olfactory stimuli), and A conversation starter (subtheme: Opportunity for self-expression) reveal the success of the intervention and the value of olfactory stimuli. Multisensory boxes including olfactory stimulation can be an engaging intervention with scope to refine it for people with dementia and their carers in the wider community.

28256108|t|Prodromal spinocerebellar ataxia type 2: Prospects for early interventions and ethical challenges.
28256108|a|The characterization of prodromal stages in neurodegenerative disorders is becoming increasingly important because of the need for early neuroprotective therapies. Research during the past 3 decades in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 has revealed a large body of evidence suggesting that many disease features precede the manifest cerebellar syndrome, which delineates the prodromal stage of this disorder. This stage is defined by clinical, imaging, and functional criteria, which are supported by early molecular events demonstrated in animal models. Knowledge regarding prodromal spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 provides insight into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration from the early stages, which enables the design of promising disease-modifying clinical trials through the identification of the optimum moment to begin the therapies, the appropriate selection of individuals, and the identification of sensitive outcome measures. The management of patients in prodromal spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 may raise ethical dilemmas related to predictive diagnosis and early interventions, which impose new challenges to clinical and therapeutic research.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

28523557|t|Single-Cell Genomics Unravels Brain Cell-Type Complexity.
28523557|a|The brain is the most complex tissue in terms of cell types that it comprises, to the extent that it is still poorly understood. Single cell genome and transcriptome profiling allow to disentangle the neuronal heterogeneity, enabling the categorization of individual neurons into groups with similar molecular signatures. Herein, we unravel the current state of knowledge in single cell neurogenomics. We describe the molecular understanding of the cellular architecture of the mammalian nervous system in health and in disease; from the discovery of unrecognized cell types to the validation of known ones, applying these state-of-the-art technologies.

29654189|t|Restoring Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 Balance in the Neurodegenerative Brain Relieves Epigenetic Transcriptional Repression and Reinstates Cognition.
29654189|a|Cognitive decline is a debilitating hallmark during preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the causes remain unclear. Because histone acetylation homeostasis is critical for mediating epigenetic gene control throughout neuronal development, we postulated that its misregulation contributes to cognitive impairment preceding AD pathology. Here, we show that disruption of Tip60 histone acetlytransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) homeostasis occurs early in the brain of an AD-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) Drosophila model and triggers epigenetic repression of neuroplasticity genes well before Abeta plaques form in male and female larvae. Repressed genes display enhanced HDAC2 binding and reduced Tip60 and histone acetylation enrichment. Increasing Tip60 in the AD-associated APP brain restores Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance by decreasing HDAC2 levels, reverses neuroepigenetic alterations to activate synaptic plasticity genes, and reinstates brain morphology and cognition. Such Drosophila neuroplasticity gene epigenetic signatures are conserved in male and female mouse hippocampus and their expression and Tip60 function is compromised in hippocampus from AD patients. We suggest that Tip60 HAT/HDAC2-mediated epigenetic gene disruption is a critical initial step in AD that is reversed by restoring Tip60 in the brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mild cognitive impairment is a debilitating hallmark during preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its causes remain unclear. Although recent findings support elevated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) as a cause for epigenetic repression of synaptic genes that contribute to cognitive deficits, whether alterations in histone acetlytransferase (HAT) levels that counterbalance HDAC2 repressor action occur and the identity of these HATs remain unknown. We demonstrate that disruption of Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 homeostasis occurs early in the AD Drosophila brain and triggers epigenetic repression of neuroplasticity genes before Abeta plaques form. Increasing Tip60 in the AD brain restores Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance, reverses neuroepigenetic alterations to activate synaptic genes, and reinstates brain morphology and cognition. Our data suggest that disruption of the Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance is a critical initial step in AD.

29772202|t|RNP-Granule Assembly via Ataxin-2 Disordered Domains Is Required for Long-Term Memory and Neurodegeneration.
29772202|a|Human Ataxin-2 is implicated in the cause and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA-2). In Drosophila, a conserved atx2 gene is essential for animal survival as well as for normal RNP-granule assembly, translational control, and long-term habituation. Like its human homolog, Drosophila Ataxin-2 (Atx2) contains polyQ repeats and additional intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). We demonstrate that Atx2 IDRs, which are capable of mediating liquid-liquid phase transitions in vitro, are essential for efficient formation of neuronal mRNP assemblies in vivo. Remarkably, DeltaIDR mutants that lack neuronal RNP granules show normal animal development, survival, and fertility. However, they show defects in long-term memory formation/consolidation as well as in C9ORF72 dipeptide repeat or FUS-induced neurodegeneration. Together, our findings demonstrate (1) that higher-order mRNP assemblies contribute to long-term neuronal plasticity and memory, and (2) that a targeted reduction in RNP-granule formation efficiency can alleviate specific forms of neurodegeneration.

29874283|t|Olfactory functioning in adults with Tourette syndrome.
29874283|a|Tourette syndrome is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder can be found. The overlap between neuroanatomical regions and neurotransmitter systems in the olfactory system and the pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome let us hypothesize altered olfactory performance in Tourette syndrome. The main objective of this study was to systematically assess olfactory functioning in subjects with Tourette syndrome and to compare it to healthy controls. We assessed 28 adults with Tourette syndrome (age 33.1+-9.4 years, disease duration 23.7+-9.7 years) and 28 healthy controls (age 32.9+-9.0 years) matched in regard to age, sex, education and smoking habits. The "Sniffin Sticks" test battery was applied to assess odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Additionally, the combined score of the odor threshold test, the odor discrimination test and the odor identification test of the "Sniffin Sticks" test battery was calculated. Although it was not the primary aim of this study, we assessed whether tics and comorbidity could contribute to olfactory alterations in adults with Tourette syndrome. Therefore, clinical scores were used to assess severity of tics and co-morbidity such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression in subjects with Tourette syndrome. Pathology of the nasal cavities was excluded with rhinoendoscopy. Independent sample t-tests were applied to compare performance in olfactory tests. In the case of statistically significant differences (critical p-value: 0.05), multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to explore whether tic severity, social impairment, co-morbidity or medical treatment had an impact on the differences found. Descriptive values are reported as mean +- standard deviation. Tourette syndrome subjects showed lower combined scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 31.9 +- 5.1 versus healthy controls 35.0 +- 3.1; p = 0.007), odor identification scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.4 +- 2.0 versus healthy controls 13.7 +- 1.4; p = 0.008) and odor discrimination scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.1 +- 2.1 versus healthy controls 13.2 +- 1.6; p = 0.041) in comparison to healthy subjects, while there was no difference in odor threshold (Tourette syndrome subjects 7.3 +- 2.7 versus healthy controls 8.1 +- 2.2; p = 0.22). Seven out of 28 Tourette syndrome subjects (25%) scored in the range of the age- and sex-dependent combined score for hyposmia, while two of 28 healthy controls (7%) had a similar low combined score. None of the participants were found to have functional anosmia. Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that social impairment may a predictor for low combined score and odor identification score in Tourette syndrome subjects (p = 0.003). Compared to healthy controls, altered olfaction in adults with Tourette syndrome was found in this study. Normal odor threshold level but lower scores at tasks involving supra-threshold odor concentrations point towards a central-nervous alteration in the processing of olfactory information in Tourette syndrome.

30467777|t|Olfactory function and olfactory bulb volume in Wilson's disease.
30467777|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the olfactory function and the olfactory bulb (OB) volume changes in Wilson's Disease (WD) patients. METHODS: A prospective, controlled, single-blinded study was planned. 12 patients with WD (Group 1) and 12 healthy subjects (Group 2) were included in the study. Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test was applied to evaluate olfactory functions. OB volumes were measured with a 1.5 T General Electric Signa Excite MRI scanner. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the CCCRC scores of the two groups (p < 0.05). The difference of the OB volumes of the two groups was insignificant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WD patients are likely to experience olfactory dysfunction, so its assessment may be a useful tool to the follow-up care of these patients, although further studies are needed to evaluate correlations in WD evolution.

30501069|t|Iso-alpha-Acids, the Bitter Components of Beer, Suppress Microglial Inflammation in rTg4510 Tauopathy.
30501069|a|Due to the growth in aging populations, prevention for cognitive decline and dementia are in great demand. We previously demonstrated that the consumption of iso-alpha-acids (IAA), the hop-derived bitter compounds in beer, prevents inflammation and Alzheimer's disease pathology in model mice. However, the effects of iso-alpha-acids on inflammation induced by other agents aside from amyloid beta have not been investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that the consumption of iso-alpha-acids suppressed microglial inflammation in the frontal cortex of rTg4510 tauopathy mice. In addition, the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1beta and MIP-1beta, in the frontal cortex of rTg4510 mice were greater than those of wild-type mice, and were reduced in rTg4510 mice fed with iso-alpha-acids. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the expression of cells producing CD86, CD68, TSPO, MIP-1alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in microglia was increased in rTg4510 mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, the expression of CD86- and MIP-1alpha-producing cells was reduced in rTg4510 mice administered with iso-alpha-acids. Moreover, the consumption of iso-alpha-acids reduced the levels of phosphorylated tau in the frontal cortex. Collectively, these results suggest that the consumption of iso-alpha-acids prevents the inflammation induced in tauopathy mice. Thus, iso-alpha-acids may help in preventing inflammation-related brain disorders.

31104170|t|A semi-quantitative sport-specific assessment of recurrent traumatic brain injury: the TraQ questionnaire and its application in American football.
31104170|a|Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is very frequent and studied among contact sport players, above all American Football. Now, the defined diagnosis is only post-mortem and, consequently, more detailed diagnostic in-vivo instruments are needed to facilitate diagnosis and to allow a follow up. This clinical questionnaire (Trauma Questionnaire-TraQ) has been designed to investigate in parallel the traumatic load and clinical and cognitive subjective symptoms. It evaluates 4 anamnestic fields (specific sport activity, all previous pathological events, clinical manifestations compatible with TBI (traumatic brain injury) or CTE and subjective perception of personal memory efficacy with PRMQ questionnaire). The aim of TraQ questionnaire is to allow a standardized follow-up of active players and to identify subclinical disturbances that may become warnings. A pilot comparative study with TraQ on 105 subjects (75 AF players and 30 comparable people without a history of contact-sports activity) revealed that AF players have an increased amount of severe head trauma, an amplified level of subjective aggressiveness, more olfactory deficits but also more speech subjective problems, previously never related with CTE. In view of the obtained results, the TraQ seems to be useful (1) to obtain a better quantification of the traumatic load; (2) to differentiate the risk of long-term neurological consequences, allowing better management of different athletes right from the pre-symptomatic phases; (3) to manage prevention strategies if regularly applied to periodic visits to sports fitness; and (4) to identify the predisposing factors for the development of CTE and other neurological consequences of TBI with follow-up studies.

32436947|t|Early deficits in olfaction are associated with structural and molecular alterations in the olfactory system of a Huntington disease mouse model.
32436947|a|Olfactory dysfunction and altered neurogenesis are observed in several neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington disease (HD). These deficits occur early and correlate with a decline in global cognitive performance, depression and structural abnormalities of the olfactory system including the olfactory epithelium, bulb and cortices. However, the role of olfactory system dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HD remains poorly understood and the mechanisms underlying this dysfunction are unknown. We show that deficits in odour identification, discrimination and memory occur in HD individuals. Assessment of the olfactory system in an HD murine model demonstrates structural abnormalities in the olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex, the primary cortical recipient of OB projections. Furthermore, a decrease in piriform neuronal counts and altered expression levels of neuronal nuclei and tyrosine hydroxylase in the OB are observed in the YAC128 HD model. Similar to the human HD condition, olfactory dysfunction is an early phenotype in the YAC128 mice and concurrent with caspase activation in the murine HD OB. These data provide a link between the structural olfactory brain region atrophy and olfactory dysfunction in HD and suggest that cell proliferation and cell death pathways are compromised and may contribute to the olfactory deficits in HD.

33027749|t|Serum TNF-alpha and neurodegeneration in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder.
33027749|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum inflammatory cytokine profiles in patients with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and to explore whether these markers are associated with phenoconversion risk to alpha-synucleinopathies. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we analyzed serum samples from patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 12). We measured the following cytokines: interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). All patients underwent motor and non-motor evaluations and dopamine transporter imaging at baseline for predicting the phenoconversion risk. We followed the patients quarterly over up to 6 years to identify disease conversion. We also assessed longitudinal changes in cytokine levels from baseline at the 2- and 4-year follow-up visits. RESULTS: The baseline cytokine levels did not differ between the patients and controls. However, the TNF-alpha levels were significantly increased in a subgroup of the patients with multiple markers (>=3) for phenoconversion risk compared to those without (p = 0.008) and controls (p = 0.003). At longitudinal analyses, patients with TNF-alpha levels above the median showed a higher incidence of phenoconversion than those with lower TNF-alpha levels (47% vs. 7%; p = 0.008), and this significant association persisted after adjusting for covariates (p = 0.026). The cytokine levels over 4 years of follow-up period did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a possible link between serum TNF-alpha and phenoconversion risk in iRBD. Further studies are warranted to confirm the role of peripheral TNF-alpha in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in this disorder.

The rats were divided into three groups: six as the control, six as the SHAM, and 16 as the study group in which OBX was performed. The animals were followed for 10 weeks. After decapitation of the animals, olfactory bulb (OB) volumes, the olfactory glomerulus (OG), and the neuron density of the ON (Onuf nucleus) per cubic centimeter at the L4-S4 level were examined histopathologically and analyzed stereologically. RESULTS: The mean OB volume, remaining normal OG density, and degenerated neuron density (DND) of the ON was measured as 4.32 +- 0.21/mm3 , 1842 +- 114/mm3 , and 4 +- 1 /mm3 in the control (group I); 3.3 +- 0.14/mm3 , 1321 +- 114/mm3 , and 43 +- 8/mm3 in the SHAM (group II); and 1.672 +- 0.12/mm3 , 852 +- 93/mm3 , and 154 +- 11/mm3 in the study group (group III). There was a statistically significant difference between the SHAM and the study group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, histopathological bridging between ON-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and OBX was shown the first time. According to the findings, LUTS may be reversed by the protection of the affected spinal cord through the correction of olfaction impairment in neurodegenerative disease.

33374894|t|Sweet but Bitter: Focus on Fructose Impact on Brain Function in Rodent Models.
33374894|a|Fructose consumption has drastically increased during the last decades due to the extensive commercial use of high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener for beverages, snacks and baked goods. Fructose overconsumption is known to induce obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and inflammation, and its metabolism is considered partially responsible for its role in several metabolic diseases. Indeed, the primary metabolites and by-products of gut and hepatic fructolysis may impair the functions of extrahepatic tissues and organs. However, fructose itself causes an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion that triggers inflammation and oxidative stress. Many studies have dealt with the effects of this sugar on various organs, while the impact of fructose on brain function is, to date, less explored, despite the relevance of this issue. Notably, fructose transporters and fructose metabolizing enzymes are present in brain cells. In addition, it has emerged that fructose consumption, even in the short term, can adversely influence brain health by promoting neuroinflammation, brain mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, as well as insulin resistance. Fructose influence on synaptic plasticity and cognition, with a major impact on critical regions for learning and memory, was also reported. In this review, we discuss emerging data about fructose effects on brain health in rodent models, with special reference to the regulation of food intake, inflammation, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, insulin signaling and cognitive function.

33443872|t|Parosmia in Right-lateralized Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia: A Case Report.
33443872|a|Parosmia, defined as the distorted perception of an odor stimulus, has been reported to be associated with head trauma, upper respiratory tract infections, sinonasal diseases, and toxin/drug consumption. To date, little is known about parosmia in right-lateralized semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. A 60-year-old right-handed man presented with a 2-year history of parosmia and prosopagnosia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated severe atrophy of the right anterior and mesial temporal lobe, particularly in the fusiform cortex and the regions known as the primary olfactory cortex. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose position emission tomography showed asymmetric hypometabolism of the bilateral temporal lobes (right > left). We clinically diagnosed him with right-lateralized semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. As the right hemisphere is known to be more involved in the processing of pleasant odors than the left hemisphere, we speculate that the unique manifestation of parosmia observed in this patient might be associated with the lateralization of the olfactory system.

33731679|t|The additive effect of late-life depression and olfactory dysfunction on the risk of dementia was mediated by hypersynchronization of the hippocampus/fusiform gyrus.
33731679|a|Early detection of patients with late-life depression (LLD) with a high risk of developing dementia contributes to early intervention. Odor identification (OI) dysfunction serves as a marker for predicting dementia, but whether OI dysfunction increases the risk of dementia in LLD patients remains unclear. The present study aimed to explore the interactive effect of LLD and OI dysfunction on the risk of dementia and its underlying neuroimaging changes. One hundred and fifty-seven LLD patients and 101 normal controls were recruited, and data on their OI, cognition, activity of daily living (ADL), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were collected. Two x two factorial analyses were used to analyze the interactive effects of LLD and OI dysfunction on neuropsychological and neuroimaging abnormalities. Mediation analyses were used to explore whether abnormalities detected by neuroimaging mediated the the associations between OI and cognition/ADL. The results suggested that LLD and OI dysfunction exhibited additive effects on reduced ADL, global cognition and memory scores, as well as neuroimaging variables including (i) increased fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) in the right orbitofrontal cortex and right precentral cortex, and (ii) increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the left hippocampus/fusiform gyrus, etc. In addition, these increased fALFF and ReHo values were associated with reduced neuropsychological scores (ADL, global cognition, memory, and language). Moreover, ReHo of the left hippocampus/fusiform gyrus completely mediated the relationship between OI and ADL, and partially mediated the relationship between OI and global cognition. Overall, mediated by the hypersynchronization of the left hippocampus/fusiform gyrus, OI dysfunction may increase the risk of dementia in LLD patients.

34209997|t|The Olfactory System as Marker of Neurodegeneration in Aging, Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
34209997|a|Research studies that focus on understanding the onset of neurodegenerative pathology and therapeutic interventions to inhibit its causative factors, have shown a crucial role of olfactory bulb neurons as they transmit and propagate nerve impulses to higher cortical and limbic structures. In rodent models, removal of the olfactory bulb results in pathology of the frontal cortex that shows striking similarity with frontal cortex features of patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders. Widely different approaches involving behavioral symptom analysis, histopathological and molecular alterations, genetic and environmental influences, along with age-related alterations in cellular pathways, indicate a strong correlation of olfactory dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Indeed, declining olfactory acuity and olfactory deficits emerge either as the very first symptoms or as prodromal symptoms of progressing neurodegeneration of classical conditions. Olfactory dysfunction has been associated with most neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and communication disorders. Evidence revealing the dual molecular function of the olfactory receptor neurons at dendritic and axonal ends indicates the significance of olfactory processing pathways that come under environmental pressure right from the onset. Here, we review findings that olfactory bulb neuronal processing serves as a marker of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

34715608|t|Increased neural motor activation and functional reorganization in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
34715608|a|INTRODUCTION: Altered brain activity and functional reorganization patterns during self-initiated movements have been reported in early pre-motor and motor stages of Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether similar alterations can be observed in patients with idiopathic REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD). METHODS: 13 polysomnography-confirmed male and right-handed RBD patients and 13 healthy controls underwent a bilateral hand-movement fMRI task including internally selected (INT) and externally-guided (EXT) movement conditions for each hand. We examined functional activity and connectivity differences between groups and task-conditions, structural differences using voxel-based morphometry, as well as associations between functional activity and clinical variables. RESULTS: No group differences were observed in fMRI-task performance or in voxel-based morphometry. Both groups showed faster reaction times and exhibited greater neural activation when movements were internally selected compared to externally-guided tasks. Compared to controls, RBD patients displayed stronger activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and primary somatosensory cortex during INT-tasks, and in the right fronto-insular cortex during EXT-tasks performed with the non-dominant hand. Stronger activation in RBD patients was associated with cognitive and olfactory impairment. Connectivity analysis demonstrated overall less interregional coupling in patients compared to controls. In particular, patients showed reduced temporo-cerebellar, occipito-cerebellar and intra-cerebellar connectivity, but stronger connectivity in fronto-cerebellar and fronto-occipital pathways. CONCLUSION: The observed stronger activation during hand-movement tasks and connectivity changes in RBD may reflect early compensatory and reorganization patterns in order to preserve motor functioning. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding and prognosis of prodromal stages of alpha-synucleinopathies.

34900915|t|Is Olfactory Impairment Associated With 10-year Mortality Mediating by Neurodegenerative Diseases in Older Adults? The Four-Way Decomposition Analysis.
34900915|a|Background: Literature shows that olfactory impairment (OI) is associated not only with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), but also with increased mortality. In this study, we analyzed data collected from the prospective phase of the 10-year follow-up of the Shanghai Aging Study (SAS) to explore the mediation effect of NDDs on the OI-mortality relationship. Methods: We analyzed data collected from the prospective phase of the 10-year follow-up of the SAS. We included 1,811 participants aged 60 years or older who completed both an olfactory identification test and a cognitive assessment at baseline (2010-2011). Survival status of the participants from baseline to December 31, 2019 was obtained from the local mortality surveillance system. We used the four-way decomposition method to attribute effects to interaction and mediation and to explore the mediation effect of NDDs on the OI-mortality relationship. Results: The four-way decomposition method revealed a statistically significant association of OI with death. Overall, 43% higher risk for death was associated with OI [excess relative risk (ERR) = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.06-0.80, p = 0.023]. Excluding the mediation from NDDs and interaction between OI and NDDs, the controlled direct effect of OI on death was even higher in NDDs participants, with an ERR of 77% (95% CI: 0.00-1.55, p = 0.050). Statistically significant association was found for failure to identify coffee (ERR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.18-1.36, p = 0.010) and marginally significant associations were found for failure to identify cinnamon (ERR = 0.33, 95% CI: -0.02-0.68, p = 0.068) and rose (ERR = 0.33, 95% CI: -0.01-0.67, p = 0.054) with death. Conclusion: OI was associated with the long-term mortality in older adults and the association was even stronger in those with NDDs. Failure to identify coffee or rose was associated with a higher mortality risk, and the association was mediated by NDDs.

36702351|t|Relative size of fungiform papillae in patients with neurofibromatosis Type 1.
36702351|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore possible manifestations of neurofibromatosis on the tongue, especially, enlarged papillae fungiformes. According to the literature, enlarged fungiform papillae of the tongue are a very common oral finding in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, photos of 18 NF1 patients' tongues, taken at different times were compared to rule of possible fluctuating papillae size. Secondly, 60 photos of 60 patients with NF1 were age/sex matched, blinded and compared to 60 photos of 60 healthy patients. Three independent medical doctors rated the photos in regard of the fungiform papillae as smaller/same/larger at two different times. The inter- and intraindividual results were compared. Thirdly, fungiform papillae of 11 NF1 patients were quantitatively measured using the Denver protocol. RESULTS: The fungiform papillae showed a stable size. The comparison of the healthy individuals to the NF1 patients suggests that the larger papillae are significantly more frequent in NF1 patients than in age- and gender-matched non-NF1 individuals. The agreement between two ratings of each of the 3 raters at different time points was two moderate and one substantial, the agreement among raters was only fair, since the Fleiss' Kappa value of all 6 ratings was 0.38. CONCLUSION: Although this study confirms that the evaluation of the size of the fungiform papillae by visual inspection only is very subjective, the fungiform papillae in NF1 patients do seem to be enlarged at a statistically significant level. Nonetheless the statistical difference is not distinctive enough to establish this as a diagnostic tool in diagnosing NF1. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Facilitating the diagnosis of NF1 is an important factor in finding the correct treatment for these patients. A clinical inspection of the tongue is a simple and non-invasive procedure. This paper addresses the question if an inspection of the tongue, especially the fungiform papillae is a reliable indicator for the diagnosis of NF1.

37414570|t|Association of Performance on Olfactory and Cognitive Screening Tests With Conversion to Dementia in a Biracial Cohort of Older Adults.
37414570|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Odor identification deficits are associated with transition to dementia, whereas intact odor identification and global cognition test performance may identify lack of transition. The purpose of this study is to examine intact odor identification and global cognition as prognostic indicators of lack of transition to dementia in a biracial (Black and White) cohort. METHODS: In a community-dwelling sample of older adults from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, odor identification was measured using the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) and global cognition was measured using the Teng Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (3MS). Survival analyses for dementia transition over 4 and 8 years of follow-up utilized Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: The n=2240 participants had an average age of 75.5 years (SD 2.8). 52.7% were female. 36.7% were Black and 63.3% were White. Impaired odor identification (HR=2.29, 95% CI=1.79-2.94, p<0.001) and global cognition (HR=3.31, 95% CI=2.26-4.84, p<0.001) were each independently associated with transition to dementia (n=281). Odor identification remained robustly associated with transition to dementia for Black (HR=2.02, 95% CI=1.36-3.00, p<0.001, n=821) and White participants (HR=2.45, 95% CI=1.77-3.38, p<0.001, n=1419), whereas global cognition was associated with transition among Black participants only (HR=5.06, 95% CI=3.18-8.07, p<0.001). ApoE genotype was consistently associated with transition among White participants only (HR=1.75, 95% CI=1.20-2.54, p<0.01). Among participants with intact performance on both odor identification (BSIT >=9/12 correct) and global cognition (3MS >=78/100 correct), 8.8% transitioned to dementia over 8 years. Intact performance on both measures had high positive predictive value for identifying individuals who did not transition to dementia over 4 years (0.98 for ages 70-75 with only 2.3% transitioning, 0.94 for ages 76-82 with only 5.8% transitioning). DISCUSSION: Odor identification testing paired with a global cognitive screening test identified individuals at low risk for transition to dementia in a biracial community cohort with a pronounced effect in the eighth decade of life. Identification of such individuals can reduce the need for extensive investigation to establish a diagnosis. Odor identification deficits showed utility in both Black and White participants, unlike the race-dependent utility of a global cognitive test and ApoE genotype.

37541841|t|Association of Olfaction and Microstructural Integrity of Brain Tissue in Community-Dwelling Adults: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study.
37541841|a|OBJECTIVES: Research on olfaction and brain neuropathology may help understand brain regions associated with normal olfaction and dementia pathophysiology. To identify early regional brain structures affected in poor olfaction, we examined cross-sectional associations of microstructural integrity of the brain with olfaction in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study. METHODS: Participants were selected from a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults; selection criteria included: evidence of cognitive impairment, participation in a previous MRI study, and a random sample of cognitively normal participants. Microstructural integrity was measured by two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and olfaction by a 12-item odor-identification test at the same visit. Higher FA and MD values indicate better and worse microstructural integrity, respectively, and higher odor-identification scores indicate better olfaction. We used brain region-specific linear regression models to examine associations between DTI measures and olfaction, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 1,418 participants (mean age: 76+-5years, 41% male, 21% Black race, 59% with normal cognition), the mean olfaction score was 9+-2.3. Relevant to olfaction, higher MD in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions, namely, the hippocampus (beta: -0.79 (95%CI: -0.94, -0.65) units lower olfaction score per SD higher MD), amygdala, entorhinal area, and some white matter (WM) tracts connecting to these regions, was associated with olfaction. We also observed associations with MD and WM FA in multiple atlas regions that were not previously implicated in olfaction. The associations between MD and olfaction were particularly stronger in the MTL regions among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to those with normal cognition (e.g., betahippocampus: -0.75 (95%CI: -1.02, -0.49) and -0.44 (95%CI: -0.63, -0.26) for MCI and normal cognition, respectively, p-interaction=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal microstructural integrity in multiple brain regions, in particular the MTL (the regions known to be affected in early Alzheimer's), is associated with odor-identification ability. Differential associations in the MTL regions among cognitively normal individuals compared to those with MCI may reflect the earlier vs. later effects of the dementia pathogenesis. It is likely that some of the associated regions may not have any functional relevance to olfaction.

38277878|t|Wine tannins and their aggregation/release with lipids and proteins: Review and perspectives for neurodegenerative diseases.
38277878|a|Tannins are amphiphilic molecules, often polymeric, which can be generally described as a core containing hydrophobic aromatic rings surrounded by hydroxyl groups. They have been known for millennia and are part of human culture. They are ubiquitous in nature and are best known in the context of wine and tea tasting and food cultures. However, they are also very useful for human health, as they are powerful antioxidants capable of combating the constant aggressions of everyday life. However, their mode of action is only just beginning to be understood. This review, using physicochemical concepts, attempts to summarize current knowledge and present an integrated view of the complex relationship between tannins, proteins and lipids, in the context of wine drinking while eating. There are many thermodynamic equilibria governing the interactions between tannins, saliva proteins, lipid droplets in food, membranes and the taste receptors embedded in them. Taste sensations can be explained using these multiple equilibria: for example, astringency (dry mouth) can be explained by the strong binding of tannin micelles to the proline-rich proteins of saliva, suppressing their lubricating action on the palate. In the presence of lipid droplets in food, the equilibrium is shifted towards tannin-lipid complexes, a situation that reduces the astringency perceived when consuming a tannic wine with fatty foods, the so-called "camembert effect". Tannins bind preferentially to taste receptors located in mouth membranes, but can also fluidify lipids in the non-keratinized mucous membranes of the mouth, which can impair the functioning of taste receptors there. Cholesterol, present in large quantities in keratinized mucous membranes, stiffens them and thus prevents tannins from disrupting the conduction of information through other taste receptors. As tannins assemble and disassemble depending on whether they are in contact with proteins, lipids or taste receptors, a perspective on their potential use in the context of neurodegenerative diseases where fibrillation is a key phenomenon will also be discussed.
